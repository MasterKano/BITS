# S02 — s2g3 — hip jousting, over-under fundamentals

## Goal

- Use hip jousting as the second primary training method to develop upper-body takedown skill.
- Improve over-under fundamentals under movement and contact:
  - head position discipline
  - elbow position discipline (underhook depth + overhook heaviness)
  - footwork and angle creation without losing stance
- Establish simple, repeatable “win conditions” that can scale into later takedowns.

## Focus

- Hip jousting as a structured “alive” drill: constant contact, constant micro-adjustments, balance disruption without overcommitting.
- Control priorities in over-under:
  - head position
  - elbow line (inside line)
  - hip alignment (avoid squared or overextended base)
- Efficiency over force: small steps, incremental improvements, position stacking.

## Plan (60 min)

### 0–5 min — brief + standards

- Standards for the session:
  - “Head and elbows decide the exchange.”
  - “No leaning battles; stance stays functional.”
  - “If balance breaks, reset rather than scramble.”

### 5–15 min — warm-up (contact stance + hip awareness)

- 3 x 3-minute blocks:
  - Block 1: stance movement with light collar tie / wrist contact (no clinch lock).
  - Block 2: add light shoulder-to-shoulder pressure; maintain posture and base.
  - Block 3: enter over-under and hold while walking in a small circle.
- Cues:
  - “Feet carry the pressure, not your spine.”
  - “Head contact is constant once clinched.”

### 15–25 min — hip jousting introduction (static to moving)

- Define hip jousting for this session:
  - Over-under clinch, active movement, each person tries to:
    - off-balance partner
    - improve angle
    - improve head/elbow position
    - deny partner’s improvements
- Drill progression:
  - Round 1 (3 min): slow, cooperative, feel alignment and balance points.
  - Round 2 (3 min): moderate resistance, still controlled.
  - Round 3 (3 min): moderate-to-alive, but no takedowns yet.

### 25–40 min — hip jousting rounds (win conditions)

- 3 x 3-minute rounds with 1-minute rest (switch roles/strategy each round):
  - Win conditions (score 1 point each time):
    - Achieve clear head position dominance (under the chin / jawline control) and hold 2 seconds.
    - Achieve clear angle dominance (chest turned to partner’s side; partner’s shoulders rotated) and hold 2 seconds.
    - Achieve double-unders entry and hold 2 seconds.
- Constraints:
  - No throws.
  - No full snaps or aggressive yanks.
  - If posture collapses or stance breaks, stop and reset.

### 40–50 min — targeted fixes (micro-skill blocks)

Choose the two most common failures observed so far and run them as 2 x 5 minutes:

- Failure A: losing underhook depth
  - Fix drill: re-insert underhook with elbow tight, shoulder pressure, small step to angle.
- Failure B: losing head position
  - Fix drill: head pummel (temple-to-temple), regain inside head without giving up elbows.
- Failure C: leaning / squared stance
  - Fix drill: step-reset drill—whenever posture breaks, immediate step back to stance and re-enter.

### 50–60 min — constrained game + log

- Game: hip jousting to first-to-5 points
  - Start in over-under.
  - Use the same win conditions as above.
  - If either person gets a “would-have-been takedown,” note it verbally and reset (still no throws).
- Log (2 minutes):
  - Each person writes:
    - best cue today
    - most common failure
    - one specific intention for Session 03 (entries + shot defense into grips)
