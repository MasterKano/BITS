# S05 — s2g3 — cow catcher + front headlock takedowns

## Goal

- Integrate cow catcher as a reliable resolution from front headlock scenarios:
  - when partner drives in or squares up to recover posture
  - when go-behind is denied by base/hip positioning
- Improve “front headlock decision making”:
  - go-behind vs cow catcher vs reset
  - choose based on partner’s posture, pressure direction, and base

## Focus

- Front headlock as the hub:
  - control first (posture broken + head/arm connection)
  - angle second (off-centerline)
  - finish third (select resolution path)
- Cow catcher mechanics principles:
  - convert head/arm control into turning force
  - use hips/feet to rotate partner, not arm strength
  - land in stable top position with immediate control

## Plan (60 min)

### 0–5 min — recap + constraints

- Constraints:
  - “Cow catcher only counts if it starts from real front headlock control.”
  - “No diving without posture break; control precedes commitment.”
  - “Finish must land in stable top control for 2 seconds.”

### 5–12 min — warm-up: front headlock reacquisition

- 2 x 3-minute rounds:
  - start from standing tie-up
  - objective: snapdown or shot-defense conversion to front headlock
  - freeze 2 seconds each time to check:
    - head/arm connection
    - posture broken
    - feet positioned to angle
- 1 x 1-minute round:
  - quick angle steps from front headlock (left/right), maintaining connection

### 12–25 min — technical block A: cow catcher entry conditions (decision cues)

- Define three common “green lights” to cow catcher:
  - partner drives forward into you to re-posture
  - partner squares up and resists go-behind by tracking your angle
  - partner’s base becomes narrow/heavy on one leg during posture fight
- Drill (13 min total):
  - 6 minutes each role, alternating every rep:
    - Person A establishes front headlock and calls the cue (“drive”, “square”, “narrow”).
    - Person A initiates the cow catcher entry on that cue.
    - Person B gives realistic resistance consistent with the cue.
  - Success condition: controlled turn + stable top landing (2 seconds).

### 25–40 min — technical block B: cow catcher mechanics + landing control

- Drill 1 (7 min): entry → rotation → controlled landing
  - start from front headlock control (pre-set)
  - execute cow catcher turn with emphasis on:
    - hips and feet doing the work
    - head/arm connection maintained through the rotation
  - freeze on landing and check:
    - chest-to-chest or chest-to-shoulder control
    - head position safe
    - immediate control of near hip/arm to prevent scramble
- Drill 2 (8 min): partner attempts to post / base out
  - same start
  - Person B adds realistic posting and base widening
  - Person A adjusts with:
    - tighter rotation path
    - re-angle step before committing
    - maintaining connection rather than yanking

### 40–52 min — integration block: go-behind vs cow catcher

- 3 x 4-minute rounds (short rest):
  - start from standing range
  - objective: achieve front headlock
  - once front headlock is achieved, Person A must choose:
    - go-behind finish, OR
    - cow catcher finish
  - scoring:
    - +1 for establishing front headlock with broken posture held 2 seconds
    - +2 for finishing (either path) to stable top control held 2 seconds
  - reset after any +2, or after 10 seconds of stalled control

### 52–58 min — constrained game: “force the decision”

- 2 x 3-minute rounds:
  - start from front headlock (pre-set)
  - Person B’s job: deny one pathway each round:
    - Round 1: deny go-behind (hip tracking, square)
    - Round 2: deny cow catcher (post/base, resist rotation)
  - Person A’s job: pick the correct answer quickly and finish to top control.

### 58–60 min — log + next session target

- Each person logs:
  - which cue reliably triggered cow catcher success (drive/square/narrow)
  - which failure pattern caused stalled finishes
  - one concrete adjustment for S06 (sacrifice throws from head/arm)
