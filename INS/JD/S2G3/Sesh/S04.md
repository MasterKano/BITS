# S04 — s2g3 — front headlock: snapdowns, control, basic finishes

## Goal

- Build a functional front headlock (FHL) platform:
  - acquire from tie-ups and shot defense
  - maintain control (head/arm connection, posture breaking)
  - finish the takedown into stable top position (or force a reliable reset)

## Focus

- Acquisition: snapdown mechanics + head position leverage; sprawl-to-front-head conversion.
- Control: head/neck posture break + shoulder line control; deny re-shot and re-stand.
- Resolution: go-behind style finishes and simple directional takedowns from FHL control (no complex throw chains yet).

## Plan (60 min)

### 0–5 min — recap + constraints

- Constraints:
  - “FHL only counts if posture is broken and held for 2 seconds.”
  - “No yanking the neck; break posture with whole-body movement.”
  - “Finish must land in stable top control (2 seconds) or reset.”

### 5–12 min — warm-up: tie-up to posture break

- 2 x 3-minute rounds:
  - start from light collar-tie / wrist contact
  - objective: create visible posture compromise (head down, shoulders forward) without overreaching
- 1 x 1-minute round:
  - quick re-stance and re-grip resets (hands active, feet stable)

### 12–25 min — technical block A: snapdown to front headlock acquisition

- Setup: start from neutral tie-up (collar tie / inside ties).
- Drill 1 (6 min): snapdown entry reps (alternating)
  - Person A: snapdown attempt → catch head + control near-side arm/shoulder line → freeze 2 seconds.
  - Person B: provide realistic resistance (posture fight, step back, re-square).
  - Key criteria:
    - feet step as the snap happens (don’t pull with arms only)
    - head stays connected; don’t create space while “snapping”
    - immediate re-grip to keep posture broken
- Drill 2 (7 min): snapdown with angle finish set-up (no finish yet)
  - same entry, but after freeze:
    - take a small angle step to one side (get off the centerline)
    - keep head down and shoulders controlled
    - freeze again 2 seconds

### 25–37 min — technical block B: shot defense to front headlock conversion

- Setup: structured shot entries at moderate intensity.
- Drill (12 min total): 6 minutes each role
  - Person A shoots consistently (same entry each rep).
  - Person B defends:
    - sprawl/posture control → head control established → FHL hold 2 seconds.
  - Quality criteria:
    - no panic backing straight up; sprawl hips back, weight down
    - hands climb to a controlling grip while feet rebase
    - deny immediate re-shot by maintaining head/arm connection

### 37–50 min — technical block C: basic finishes from FHL control

- Choose two finishes only (keep it tight):
  - Finish 1: go-behind / angle to back exposure into top control
  - Finish 2: front-head steering to force hands/mat contact → circle behind
- Drill (13 min total):
  - 5 minutes: Finish 1 reps (alternate)
  - 5 minutes: Finish 2 reps (alternate)
  - 3 minutes: mixed choice (call “1” or “2” mid-exchange)
- Success condition:
  - land in stable top position and hold 2 seconds, then reset to standing.

### 50–58 min — game: FHL scoring rounds

- 2 x 4-minute rounds (short rest between):
  - start from standing range (light tie-ups allowed)
  - scoring:
    - +1 for establishing FHL with broken posture held 2 seconds
    - +2 for completing a finish to stable top control held 2 seconds
  - resets:
    - after any +2
    - or after 10 seconds of stalled control

### 58–60 min — log + next session target

- Person A and Person B each log:
  - best entry (snapdown vs shot defense)
  - biggest leak (lost posture break, lost angle, lost rebase)
  - one cue to carry into S05 (cow catcher integration)
