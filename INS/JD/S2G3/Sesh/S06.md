# Session 06 — s2g3 — Shot-Defense Counters: Sumi Gaeshi / Ude Gaeshi

## Goal
- Build a reliable counter-offense layer when the opponent commits to leg attacks: convert shot defense into immediate takedown + top control (or immediate head/upper-body control on landing).

## Focus
- Defensive frames/grips that *become* the attack:
  - Whizzer + wrist control → Sumi Gaeshi line
  - Lat control + wrist control → Sumi Gaeshi line
  - Chest-wrap control → Butterfly Sumi line
  - When arm/shoulder alignment favors it → Ude Gaeshi option
- Sacrifice-throw safety + landing priority: finish in top control (chest-to-chest or chest-to-back bias), not a scramble.

## Plan (60 min)

### 0) Setup + Safety (3 min)
- Safety rules for sacrifice throws:
  - No “half-commit” falls: either commit to the throw angle or bail cleanly back to base.
  - Partner protects head/neck on descent; attacker does not crank head/arm while falling.
  - Landing priority: settle hips + chest before chasing anything else.

### 1) Warm-up (movement + connection) (7 min)
- 2 min: stance + sprawl entries (light), then immediately reconnect to a controlling tie (no extended disengagement).
- 3 min: pummel-to-shot contact drill
  - Person A pummels to contact → Person B “touch-shot” (single/double/high-crotch feel) without full blast → Person A establishes one of the three control frames (whizzer+wrist / lat+wrist / chest-wrap).
- 2 min: “angle-on-contact” reminder
  - Every time you catch the shot: create an angle before initiating the counter (don’t stay square unless the specific variation demands it).

### 2) Technical Block A — Sumi Gaeshi decision tree vs shots (18 min)

#### 2.1 Inputs (what you must feel first)
- Opponent commits to legs (single / double / high crotch) and you win one of these control situations:
  - Whizzer + wrist
  - Lat control + wrist
  - Chest-wrap (tight chest-to-shoulder/upper-back connection)

#### 2.2 Whizzer + wrist → Sumi Gaeshi (core mechanics)
- Controls
  - Whizzer: shoulder pressure + overhook line to deny them climbing posture.
  - Wrist: keep their hand from posting/peeling and to steer their shoulder line.
- Alignment cues
  - Keep their shoulder line “captured” so their hips cannot freely square and drive through.
  - Your hips under you long enough to set the angle; do not fall straight back without steering.
- Throw action (high-level sequence)
  - Angle off their drive line.
  - Load them onto your connection (upper body control first) before the fall.
  - Fall/rotate on the line that puts their base “behind” them (deny easy post/step).
- Finish priority
  - Land chest-heavy and immediately stabilize (do not chase legs on landing unless the pin is already secure).

#### 2.3 Lat + wrist → Sumi Gaeshi (core mechanics)
- Controls
  - Lat grip: clamp and “lock” torso connection so the opponent can’t freely retract/turn out.
  - Wrist: same anti-post/anti-peel function; also helps steer the fall direction.
- Key distinction vs whizzer+wrist
  - Lat grip increases torso immobilization; use it to reduce their ability to rotate out mid-fall.
- Finish priority
  - Use chest pressure to prevent them turning into you; if they try turning away, their own arm position should make it difficult (you stay connected and settle).

#### 2.4 Chest-wrap → Butterfly Sumi (core mechanics)
- Controls
  - Chest wrap: tight upper-body wrap that prevents them from “escaping your chest” as you counter.
  - Butterfly hook (as applicable): used as the lifting/tilting engine rather than relying on pure backward fall.
- Cues
  - Your hook is a lever; your chest-wrap is the steering wheel.
  - Do not separate chest-to-shoulder contact before the lift/tilt is established.
- Finish priority
  - Land with upper body already in a scoring/control-friendly relationship (don’t accept a loose scramble).

#### 2.5 Mini-drill (all Sumi entries) — “3 reps each, then switch” (6 min)
- Start: Person B initiates a *clean* shot entry at ~50–60%.
- Person A must:
  - Catch the shot and *choose* one branch (whizzer+wrist / lat+wrist / chest-wrap).
  - Execute the correct Sumi line to controlled landing.
- Coaching constraint:
  - If Person A cannot clearly name which grip branch they are on within 1 second, reset (decision latency is the failure).

### 3) Technical Block B — When to choose Ude Gaeshi (12 min)

#### 3.1 Trigger condition (decision rule)
- Choose Ude Gaeshi when:
  - The opponent’s arm/shoulder line is presented in a way that makes arm-leverage the dominant steering mechanism (i.e., you can meaningfully “turn the body through the arm/shoulder line” rather than needing classic Sumi loading).

#### 3.2 Ude Gaeshi (core mechanics cues)
- Initial control priorities
  - Secure the relevant arm/shoulder line (you need structure, not a loose grip).
  - Ensure your body position is close enough that the opponent cannot simply post and re-drive through you.
- Action cues
  - Direction is dictated by the arm/shoulder alignment: you flip them where their structure is weak, not where their base is strongest.
  - Commit to the throw only once the arm line is trapped and your angle is established.
- Finish priority
  - Land with immediate stabilization; if the landing is messy, default to chest pressure + head control rather than continuing to roll.

#### 3.3 Contrast drill — “Same shot, two answers” (6 min)
- Person B repeats the same shot entry.
- Person A runs:
  - Rep 1: Sumi branch (best-fit grip)
  - Rep 2: Ude option (only if alignment is clearly available; otherwise do Sumi again)
- Coaching constraint:
  - No forcing Ude: if alignment isn’t obvious, you must default to the reliable Sumi branch.

### 4) Game — “Shot to score” (15 min)
- Start: neutral stance at arm’s length.
- Objective:
  - Person B’s only goal: commit to a clean shot (single/double/high-crotch feel; rotate types each rep).
  - Person A’s goal: convert to takedown via Sumi/Ude and **stabilize top** for 3 seconds.
- Rounds
  - 5 x 90 seconds with 30 seconds rest/notes.
- Constraints (to force correct behavior)
  - Person A cannot sprawl and disengage: must connect and counter (if you disengage, it’s a loss of rep).
  - Person B must continue driving for 2 seconds after contact (no fake-outs) so Person A learns timing under pressure.
- Scoring
  - Person A scores only if:
    - The counter produces a clear takedown *and*
    - Top stabilization occurs (no immediate scramble escape).
  - Person B scores if:
    - They finish the legs and come up with control, or
    - Person A’s counter results in loss of position (typical sacrifice-throw failure).

### 5) Cooldown + Capture (5 min)
- Write 3 bullets each:
  - Best branch today (which grip choice worked most and why).
  - One consistent failure (decision, angle, or landing).
  - One adjustment for next session (single actionable rule).
