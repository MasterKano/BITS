# S03 — s2g3 — entries (legs → upper body), shot defense → upper body grips

## Goal

- Rehearse the 3 main entry pathways into upper body grips, with emphasis on:
  - using the legs as a gateway to upper body contact
  - converting shot defense into stable upper body grips
- Build a repeatable “get-to-grips” sequence you can apply under resistance.

## Focus

- Entry categories (train as separate modules, then blend):
  - direct upper body grip fighting → clinch
  - legs as a gateway → come up to upper body grips
  - defend a shot → climb to upper body grips
- Conversion quality:
  - after contact, immediately stabilize posture + head contact + elbow position
  - avoid “winning the grip” but losing stance/balance

## Plan (60 min)

### 0–5 min — recap + constraints

- Constraints for today:
  - “Entry only counts if you can hold the resulting clinch for 2 seconds.”
  - “If posture breaks, reset immediately.”
  - “No throwing yet; today is acquisition and conversion.”

### 5–12 min — warm-up: pummelling reacquire

- 2 x 3-minute rounds:
  - start from light tie-up → pummel to over-under
  - freeze 2 seconds every time over-under is achieved to check:
    - stance
    - head contact
    - elbows/inside position
- 1 x 1-minute round:
  - pummel while moving (circle + small angle steps)

### 12–22 min — technical block A: entry method 1 (direct grip fighting)

- Drill: 4 x 90 seconds (switch roles each rep)
  - Start from neutral hand-fighting range.
  - Objective: establish upper body grips that lead to over-under.
  - Success condition: hold stable over-under for 2 seconds (then reset).
- Coaching checks:
  - do not reach with straight posture
  - win with feet + angle rather than arm wrestling
  - head contact begins as soon as clinch is made

### 22–34 min — technical block B: entry method 2 (legs as a gateway)

- Drill: “threaten legs → come up to grips” (structured)
  - 5 minutes each role:
    - Person A initiates the leg-based entry attempt (as a gateway, not a finish).
    - Person B responds realistically.
    - Person A’s objective: convert into upper body grips and settle into over-under.
  - Swap roles.
- Constraints:
  - The gateway attempt must lead directly into upper body contact (no prolonged stalling on the legs).
  - If the conversion stalls, reset immediately and repeat.
- Quality criteria:
  - conversion is smooth (no pause between leg contact and upper body grip acquisition)
  - upper body grips are stabilized before any further action

### 34–46 min — technical block C: entry method 3 (defend shot → upper body grips)

- Drill: “shot defense → climb to grips” (structured)
  - 5 minutes each role:
    - Person A shoots (controlled intensity, consistent repetition).
    - Person B defends and immediately converts to upper body grips.
    - Success condition: person B establishes and holds over-under (or equivalent upper body control) for 2 seconds.
  - Swap roles.
- Constraints:
  - Defender prioritizes: posture recovery → upper body grip acquisition → stabilization.
  - Attacker continues to provide realistic follow-through pressure (no collapsing).

### 46–57 min — blended rounds (decision making under resistance)

- 3 x 3-minute rounds (short rest)
  - Start from standing range.
  - Each exchange:
    - attacker chooses one of the three entry methods
    - defender aims to prevent stable grip acquisition
  - Scoring:
    - 1 point for stable over-under held 2 seconds
    - reset after each score
- Coaching emphasis:
  - select entry method based on what partner gives you (don’t force one pattern)
  - if the entry fails, immediately transition to another entry category (no dead wrestling)

### 57–60 min — log + next session target

- Each person logs:
  - best entry pathway today (A/B/C)
  - biggest failure pattern (what caused the entry to stall)
  - one concrete fix to apply in S04 (front headlock theme)
