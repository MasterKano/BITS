# S01 — s2g3 — stance, central problem, pummelling core

## Goal

- Establish a shared stance/posture standard for standup exchanges.
- Encode the “central problem” framing for BJJ takedowns (control + scoring aftermath).
- Build a functional baseline pummelling skillset (structure, head position, elbow discipline, footwork) to support later systems.

## Focus

- Stance integrity under contact (no posture collapse, no overreaching).
- Head position as a primary control lever in upper-body grip fighting.
- Over-under pummelling as the foundational training method.
- Efficiency: small adjustments, constant structure, no dead time.

## Plan (60 min)

### 0–5 min — brief + standards

- Agree the standards for the session:
  - “Stay in stance while hands fight.”
  - “Head contact is continuous once clinched.”
  - “Win by structure and position, not by squeezing.”

### 5–15 min — solo movement (stance + level + angles)

- 2-minute blocks, alternating roles (observe / perform):
  - Stance: knees flexed, hips under shoulders, spine long.
  - Movement: forward/back/lateral without crossing feet (except purposeful pivots).
  - Level change: controlled drop and recover (no folding at waist).
  - Angle steps: small outside step + pivot to change alignment without losing base.
- Cues:
  - “If frozen, you should be ready to sprawl, pummel, or snap.”
  - “Hands move, but posture stays.”

### 15–25 min — concept block (central problem)

- 3-minute demonstration + 7 minutes of guided rehearsal:
  - Central problem: takedowns must produce stable, scoreable control in grappling contexts.
  - Why upper-body emphasis: control the torso/head first, then deliver the takedown with better aftermath.
- Quick rehearsal:
  - Start in stance → light tie-up → freeze and check:
    - posture
    - head height/alignment
    - base and balance

### 25–35 min — structure drill (static over-under integrity)

- Start in a neutral tie, then arrive to over-under (mirror clinch):
  - Person A: underhook on one side, overhook on the other.
  - Person B mirrors.
- 3 x 2-minute rounds:
  - Round 1: static hold + micro-adjustments (elbows, head, hips).
  - Round 2: add slow circling footwork.
  - Round 3: add light push/pull for balance testing (no throws yet).
- Constraints:
  - No yanking the head.
  - No breaking posture to “win” an exchange; win by improving position.

### 35–50 min — pummelling mechanics (progressive)

- Drill 1 (5 min): slow pummel, one change at a time
  - Inside arm swims for underhook insertion.
  - Overhook side stays heavy and closed (elbow down).
  - Head stays connected.
- Drill 2 (5 min): moving pummel
  - Circle both directions.
  - Add small angle steps while maintaining structure.
- Drill 3 (5 min): pummel to a “clean win condition”
  - Win conditions (choose 1–2 for simplicity):
    - clear double-unders position for 2 seconds
    - clear head position dominance + posture break for 2 seconds
  - Reset immediately after each win.

### 50–60 min — constrained game + log

- 2–3 rounds of 2–3 minutes:
  - Start from light tie-up.
  - Objective: arrive at over-under and win via selected win conditions (no throws).
  - Keep intensity moderate; prioritize quality.
- Log (2 minutes):
  - Each person writes:
    - 1 cue that worked
    - 1 recurring failure
    - 1 adjustment to try next session
