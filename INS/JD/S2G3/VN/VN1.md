# VIEWING NOTES – STANDING TO GROUND – UPPER BODY TAKEDOWNS

## 1.0 Volume 1

### 1.1 Introduction (0:00–4:30)

**Key concepts**
- Upper body takedowns can be extremely effective in a Jiu Jitsu ruleset when taught with correct constraints and mechanics.
- Leg tackles (single, double, high crotch) are statistically dominant, but often fail to convert into points.
- The real problem is not “can you put them down” but “can you hold them in a scoring position” under Jiu Jitsu rules.

**Position / structure**
- Lower-body control:
  - Typical leg tackle endpoint: chest-to-thigh, hands around the legs.
- Upper-body control:
  - Desired endpoints: chest-to-chest or chest-to-back.
  - Finishing positions that already match scoring criteria:
    - Chest-to-chest pin.
    - Chest-to-back / back exposure.

**Key cues / phrases**
- “Upper body control comes first before the takedown.”
- “Start with the part of the body that actually scores.”
- “Takedown plus immediate chest-to-chest/back is the real goal, not just knocking them down.”

**Drills / progressions**
- Conceptual – contrast only, no hard drill prescribed here.

### 1.2 Upper Body Takedown Concepts – The Central Problem of Takedowns in Jiu Jitsu (4:30–14:52)

**Key concepts**
- Central problem:
  - Most successful takedowns in grappling (leg tackles) give chest-to-thigh control.
  - Jiu Jitsu points require chest-to-chest, chest-to-back, or controlling hips/back on the floor for ~3 seconds.
- Scoring criteria (simplified):
  - Opponent controlled on both hips for ~3 seconds.
  - Or majority of back on floor with guard/legs passed.
  - Or back control with at least one of your knees on the ground for ~3 seconds.
- Against trained opponents:
  - Very fast escapes from scoring positions:
    - Turning to knees (turtle).
    - Turning away to get back off floor.
    - Posting to four-point from knees.
- Leg tackles:
  - Initial win at the legs.
  - The “scramble gap” between legs and upper body is where scores are lost.
- Upper body takedowns:
  - Reverse the sequence:
    - Start in chest-to-chest or chest-to-back.
    - Throw from there, landing directly into scoring control.
- Mixed strategy:
  - Must be competent in both leg tackles and upper body throws.
  - Ability to switch domains (legs ↔ upper body) is a major tactical advantage.

**Position / structure**
- Leg tackles:
  - Entry endpoint: chest-to-thigh, head often low.
  - Required progression: legs → hips/waist → chest/back.
- Upper body takedowns:
  - Entry: clinch with chest-to-chest or chest-to-back ties.
  - Finish: land with chest already dominating torso, making three-second control much easier.

**Key cues / phrases**
- “Leg tackles start at chest-to-thigh; scores come from chest-to-chest or chest-to-back.”
- “The scramble between legs and chest is where scores are lost.”
- “Upper body takedowns reverse the order of operations.”
- “Begin in the position that scores, then throw from there.”

**Drills / progressions**
- Concept drill:
  - A: Start from a shot position (chest-to-thigh). Practise climbing:
    - Chest-to-thigh → chest-to-hip → chest-to-chest/back and hold.
  - B: Start in chest-to-chest clinch. Practise simple forward throw into pin.
  - Compare ease of achieving and holding scoring control.

### 1.3 Advantages of Upper Body Takedowns (14:52–19:32)

**Key concepts**
- Main advantages vs leg tackles in Jiu Jitsu:
  1. **Start and finish in upper body control**
     - Begin with chest and grips already on torso.
     - Land directly into chest-to-chest/back control, easier three-second holds.
  2. **Reduced submission exposure**
     - Leg tackles expose:
       - Neck: guillotine, D’arce, anaconda.
       - Arms/shoulders: Kimura, armlocks.
     - Upper body posture (head level or above opponent) typically reduces these exposures.
  3. **Reduced sprawl/weight risk**
     - Failed leg tackles → you under sprawl, extended posture, easy counters.
     - Failed upper body throws less often create a “sprawl-on-neck” situation.
- Tactical advantage:
  - Opponents often specialise defensively against one domain (shots or throws).
  - Switching domains can break that specialisation.

**Position / structure**
- Upper body clinch:
  - Chest-to-chest or chest-to-back, head usually at or above opponent’s.
  - Grips around trunk/shoulders.
- Comparison:
  - Leg tackles:
    - Head often low, spine extended.
    - Arms deep around legs/hips, easy access for front headlocks and Kimura grips.
  - Upper body:
    - More upright spine, better vision and posture.
    - Arms wrapped around torso/shoulders rather than diving for ankles/hips.

**Key cues / phrases**
- “Start chest-to-chest, land chest-to-chest.”
- “Less neck and arm exposure.”
- “Avoid getting caught underneath a failed sprawl.”

**Drills / progressions**
- A/B comparison rounds:
  - Round A: Only leg tackles allowed; partner actively looks for guillotines, sprawls, turtles.
  - Round B: Only upper body throws from clinch; partner tries to turn to knees/4-point or escape.
  - Compare relative scoring success and submission/sprawl exposure.

### 1.4 Disadvantages of Upper Body Takedowns (19:32–25:44)

**Key concepts**
- Upper body throws carry specific risks:
  1. **All-or-nothing throws**
     - Tight upper body engagement gives both players strong throwing potential.
     - A failed entry can instantly reverse who gets thrown.
  2. **Roll-through problem**
     - Effective throws require momentum.
     - Excess momentum can let the opponent roll-through and reverse to top.
- Defensive solution against roll-through:
  - Post-throw body alignment:
    - Land perpendicular to opponent (forming a “T”).
    - Hips down, head up.
  - Avoid aligning your spine parallel to theirs.
  - Use posting hand and sprawl if bridge/roll threatens.

**Position / structure**
- Throw contact:
  - Close chest-to-chest, hips in, good head position.
- Ideal landing:
  - Your body across their torso (T-shape).
  - Hips heavy towards mat.
  - Head higher than hips.
- Roll-through danger:
  - If your spine is parallel with theirs and hips pop up/head drops:
    - Their bridge can reverse you to bottom.

**Key cues / phrases**
- “Close distance = both athletes have huge throwing potential.”
- “Form a T, not a line.”
- “Head up, hips down.”
- “If in doubt, post and sprawl off their bridge.”

**Drills / progressions**
- Roll-through awareness drill:
  - Start from finished-throw positions.
  - Bottom player attempts hard bridge/roll.
  - Top player practises:
    - Rotating perpendicular.
    - Head-up, hips-down posture.
    - Posting hand + small sprawl to kill momentum.
- Parallel vs perpendicular drill:
  - Deliberately land parallel and feel the roll-through.
  - Then land perpendicular and defend the same bridge.

### 1.5 Minimum Athletic Requirements to Perform the Moves in This Video (25:44–31:16)

**Key concepts**
- Throws selected for this instructional are chosen for **low athletic requirement**.
- Aim: almost anyone can perform them with modest physical preparation.
- Focus on simple, testable attributes:
  - Basic forward flexibility.
  - Simple stepping patterns (back step, inside step).
  - One-leg balance with trunk hinge.
  - Comfort entering and falling with partner support.

**Position / structure**
- Flexibility test:
  - Knees locked, back flexed, touch floor with palms or backs of hands.
- Back step pattern:
  - Step in, step back, step across (hip throw style footwork).
- Inside step pattern:
  - Turn feet and stab a foot between opponent’s legs for inside hip throws.
- One-leg balance:
  - Stand on one leg, opposite hand touches the floor; return to stance with control.
- Supported entry:
  - From clinch, partner supports bodyweight as you:
    - Step between legs.
    - Rotate trunk and look away.
    - Fall to your side, not your back.

**Key cues / phrases**
- “Minimum requirements, not athletic feats.”
- “Lock knees, touch the mat with your hands.”

### 1.6 Entering Into Upper Body Grips: The 3 Main Methods – The Legs as a Gateway to the Upper Body (31:16–33:39)

**Key concepts**
- Three main routes to upper body grips:
  1. Your own leg attacks (single, double, high shots).
  2. Opponent’s leg attacks (defending their shots).
  3. Direct upper body grip fighting.
- Legs as a gateway:
  - Leg attacks often force opponent to sprawl or stand tall.
  - Either response opens a path from legs → waist → upper body grips.

**Position / structure**
- Gateway path from shot:
  - Penetrate on legs → opponent sprawls/backs hips away.
  - Your hands climb from behind knees to hips/waist.
  - Continue up to underhooks or body lock.
- High shots:
  - Driving them upward allows you to wrap around hips/waist.
  - Leg is a handle that helps bring torso into range.

**Key cues / phrases**
- “Legs are the gateway to the upper body.”
- “Attack the legs to climb to the waist.”
- “Draw the leg in; when they sprawl, come up to grips.”

**Drills / progressions**
- Integration drill:
  - Shooter:
    - Attacks single/double.
    - On sprawl/hip back, must always climb to upper body grips rather than disengage.
  - Defender:
    - Gives realistic sprawl/hip reactions without heavy counters.

### 1.7 Defending a Shot (33:39–35:22)

**Key concepts**
- Every defended shot is an opportunity for upper body control.
- Two core patterns:
  1. **Single-leg defence → overhook/whizzer tie**
     - Whizzer + wrist control.
     - Free the leg and climb to over-under / overhook-based clinch.
  2. **Double-leg defence → underhook tie**
     - Turn towards the head.
     - Scoop underhook and lift them back to standing into clinch.

**Position / structure**
- Single leg:
  - Opponent has one leg.
  - You establish:
    - Strong overhook/whizzer on near arm.
    - Wrist control on their attacking hand.
  - Leg is pulled free; transition into over-under or similar.
- Double leg:
  - Opponent on both legs.
  - You turn towards their head.
  - Thread underhook and bring them upright.
  - Convert to body lock or over-under.

**Key cues / phrases**
- “Whizzer plus wrist; leg back, climb up.”
- “Always turn towards the head on doubles.”
- “Every defended shot is an opportunity for upper body grips.”

**Drills / progressions**
- Defence-to-clinch drill:
  - Partner starts with controlled single or double.
  - Defender runs the appropriate chain:
    - Single → whizzer + wrist → free leg → clinch.
    - Double → turn-in + underhook → stand-up clinch.
  - Reset each rep.

### 1.8 Upper Body Grip Fighting (35:22–40:56)

**Key concepts**
- Primary upper body grip families:
  - Underhooks.
  - Overhooks.
  - Two-on-one.
  - Arm drag & lat grip.
- Secondary families:
  - Double underhooks.
  - Double overhooks.
  - Special grips (covered later).
- Concept of upgrading grips:
  - Turn “good” grips into “great” grips:
    - Wrist control → two-on-one → arm drag & lat.
    - Collar tie → underhook.
    - Intentionally expose ribs to invite underhook → convert to overhook.

**Position / structure**
- Underhook entries:
  - From collar tie:
    - Wedge your elbow/shoulder inside their arm.
    - Punch hand through to underhook.
  - “Knock and punch”:
    - Knock biceps/forearm to open line.
    - Shoot underhook immediately.
- Overhook entries (baiting underhook):
  - Flare elbow and show “space”.
  - When they underhook, clamp into overhook.
- Two-on-one / arm drag:
  - When you gain two-on-one on wrist/arm:
    - Rotate and step to create drag.
    - Progress to arm drag with shoulder contact and lat grip.

**Key cues / phrases**
- “Elbow inside, then punch for the underhook.”
- “Knock to open, then shoot the underhook.”
- “Expose your ribs to get an overhook.”
- “Any two-on-one can become arm drag and lat.”

**Drills / progressions**
- Underhook entry drill:
  - Partner gives collar ties.
  - You alternate:
    - Wedge-and-punch underhook.
    - Knock-and-punch underhook.
- Overhook bait drill:
  - You offer underhook; partner takes it.
  - You clamp and stabilise overhook; reset.
- Two-on-one drill:
  - Partner alternates:
    - Wrist grabs.
    - Collar ties.
  - You must convert each into two-on-one → brief arm drag position → reset.

### 1.9 The First Great Training Method to Develop Upper Body Skills: Pummelling (40:56–50:49)

**Key concepts**
- Pummelling is a primary **skill-development tool**, not just a warm-up.
- Layers of learning:
  1. Head movement (side-to-side, shoulder-to-shoulder).
  2. Arm threading and inside control.
  3. Elbow management:
     - Wide elbows = easy.
     - Tight elbows = realistic, competitive inside fight.
  4. Double underhooks:
     - Close elbows to prevent opponent inserting underhook and win both.
  5. Head control integration:
     - When they drop level, access front headlock-type grips.
  6. Scoring behaviours:
     - Lifting feet.
     - Putting hand(s) to the mat.
     - Achieving double underhooks or head control.

**Position / structure**
- Stance:
  - Hips back, shoulders forward, knees bent, weight towards toes.
- Base pummelling:
  - One underhook, one overhook each.
  - Heads active, not static.
- Elbow closure:
  - Use your ribs/lat to block their arm’s path.
  - Creates double underhooks for you.

**Key cues / phrases**
- “Head moves first, arm follows.”
- “Elbows wide is easy, elbows tight is real.”
- “Close your elbow to steal the second underhook.”
- “Count double underhooks, front headlock, and off-balances as points.”

**Drills / progressions**
- Progressive pummelling:
  1. Head-only:
     - Just move heads shoulder-to-shoulder.
  2. Easy pummelling:
     - Wide elbows, smooth exchanges.
  3. Tight pummelling:
     - Elbows closed, both trying to gain double unders / deny inside path.
  4. Head-control integration:
     - Any time partner drops level, snap/head-pull moments into front headlock.
  5. Scoring game:
     - +1 double underhooks.
     - +1 front headlock.
     - +1 lifting both feet.
     - +1 forcing a clean hand to the mat.

### 1.10 The Second Great Training Method to Develop Upper Body Skills: Hip Jousting (50:49+)

**Key concepts**
- Hip jousting = lower-body complement to pummelling:
  - Pummelling: inside control with arms and head.
  - Hip jousting: control of hip relationship in underhook–whizzer ties.
- Core problem:
  - In underhook–whizzer, opponent needs **space in front of your hips** for many throws.
  - Your job: remove that space by “checking” with your hip.
- Shoulder–hip relationship:
  - Shoulders in front of hips → more vulnerable to forward throws.
  - Shoulders behind hips, hips forward → more vulnerable to backward throws.
- Dilemma:
  - If opponent hollows hips back and leans forward → forward throws.
  - If opponent drives hips in and shoulders back → backward throws.
- Hip check:
  - Acts like a “sprawl” for upper body:
    - When they step hips in, you meet them with your hip instead of yielding space.

**Position / structure**
- Base tie:
  - You have underhook/tight waist.
  - Opponent has strong whizzer.
- Hip check:
  - As they step their hips into the gap:
    - You step your hip into that same space, touching hips.
    - Keep shoulders slightly behind hips to avoid forward throw vulnerability.
- Counteroffence:
  - After a solid hip check and off-balance:
    - Step across or around into the space they vacated.
    - Choose forward/backward attacks based on their shoulder–hip alignment.

**Key cues / phrases**
- “Never present empty space in front of your hips.”
- “Touch your hip to their hip.”
- “Shoulders in front of hips = forward throw; shoulders behind hips = backward throw.”
- “Hip check is your upper-body sprawl.”

**Drills / progressions**
- Static hip check:
  - Start in underhook–whizzer.
  - Whizzer player steps hips in.
  - Underhook player practises hip checking every entry.
- Semi-live hip jousting game:
  - Underhook vs whizzer, light to moderate resistance.
  - Whizzer player:
    - Repeatedly tries to step in for entries.
  - Underhook player:
    - Hip checks every step-in.
    - Walks across them after successful checks to off-balance.
- Directionality drill:
  - Partner alternates between:
    - Hips back, shoulders forward.
    - Hips forward, shoulders back.
  - You choose appropriate forward or backward entry after hip check.
