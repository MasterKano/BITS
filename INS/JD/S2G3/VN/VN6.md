Viewing Notes – S2G – Volume 6: Double Overhooks & Double Underhooks

6.1 Double Overhooks – Understanding Double Overhooks (0:00–5:07)
- Goal
  - Understand when double overhooks are actually functional instead of “inferior”.
  - Learn how to neutralise an opponent’s double underhooks and convert to your offense.

- Key concepts
  - Double underhooks are only dominating if they get angle (behind you) or level (down to your lumbar/hips).
  - If you square up, drop level and keep hips back, the position becomes much more neutral.
  - Trapping both of their arms with your overhooks denies them the ability to post when they fall.
  - Make them carry your weight to fatigue the arms and grip.

- Positional landmarks
  - Opponent starts underneath your arms with double underhooks/body lock pressure.
  - Your hips are back, shoulders roughly over hips (not folded).
  - Elbows dropped to their elbows or hips, hands/forearms posting on hips if necessary.
  - Hands join in front of their chest/ribs (fists together or clasp), locking their arms in.

- Mechanics & details
  - Immediately prevent angle: circle and square up each time they try to move behind you.
  - Immediately prevent deep level: shove hips back and down; if they chase, thumb-posts inside hip bones.
  - Slide elbows down to meet their elbows and clamp in; then join hands to trap their underhooks.
  - Once arms are stuck, walk back and circle so they carry your weight and cannot easily lift.
  - Keep head position neutral or slightly offset to the side you expect to throw to.

- Coaching cues
  - “No angle, no level” – square and drop before doing anything else.
  - “Hands in, hips back” – post on hips early, then clamp.
  - “Make him hold you” – let him get tired holding your weight.
  - “Arms stuck = no posts” – once you lock the overhooks, think about throws immediately.

- Common errors
  - Letting them sink to your hips before reacting.
  - Staying tall so they can lift your feet off the mat.
  - Allowing them to run behind you while you stay planted.
  - Overreaching with arms so your own posture collapses.

6.2 Ouchi Gari (Inside Trip) from Double Overhooks (5:07–10:00)
- Goal
  - Use double overhooks to hit a strong inside trip where the opponent cannot post.

- Key concepts
  - The overhooks and hand lock hold them in front of you and stop arm posting.
  - Hips must stay back until you are ready to step; then step in with the reaping leg.
  - Head direction determines where they fall: look in the direction of the throw.

- Positional landmarks
  - Start from squared stance with double overhooks and hands joined in front of their chest.
  - Your hips back, their shoulders roughly above or slightly in front of their hips.
  - Trip leg steps slightly forward and inside their foot on the chosen side.

- Mechanics & details
  - Load weight onto the non-reaping leg; the reaping leg steps deep between their feet.
  - Hook behind their heel/calf with the inside of your foot (classic ouchi path).
  - As you reap, pull their upper body forward and slightly across the tripping leg.
  - Turn your head and chest toward the side you want them to land; keep elbows tight.
  - Land chest-to-chest or in a strong top position (often half guard or side control type alignment).

- Coaching cues
  - “Hips back, then step in” – do not bring hips forward before the step.
  - “Hook, then head turns” – leg hooks as the head and chest rotate.
  - “No space in the arms” – keep overhooks tight so they cannot free an arm.

- Common errors
  - Trying to reap before off-balancing the upper body.
  - Letting your head drift backward (you fall instead of them).
  - Leaving elbow space so they can whizzer or pummel out mid-entry.

6.3 Step-Around Kosoto Gake from Double Overhooks (10:00–14:53)
- Goal
  - Use a step-around outside trip to take them straight back while maintaining overhooks.

- Key concepts
  - Same principle as ouchi: arms control posting, legs create the off-balance.
  - Safety footwork: “step, step” so both sets of knees face the same safe direction.
  - Sit into an imaginary chair – you drop them backwards, not straight sideways.

- Positional landmarks
  - Double overhooks locked; opponent upright in front of you.
  - Your near leg steps around their near side; second step brings you to a safe alignment.
  - Your outside leg reaps behind both of their legs.

- Mechanics & details
  - Start by making them carry weight – lean them slightly forward so they brace.
  - Step the near foot around and behind their heel line.
  - Second “safety step” aligns both sets of knees to face the same direction, preventing awkward twisting.
  - Sit back as if into a chair while pulling their upper body over the reap.
  - Keep chest heavy as you land; follow their fall into a pinning position.

- Coaching cues
  - “One, two, sit” – step around, safety step, sit into the throw.
  - “Knees same way” – check both partners’ knees point in the same direction before you sit.
  - “Look where you want them to land.”

- Common errors
  - Rotating before the second safety step is in place.
  - Letting the reaping leg stay too shallow (you just bump, don’t reap).
  - Falling sideways with no chest connection so they can scramble.

6.4 Calf-to-Calf Kosoto Gake from Double Overhooks (14:53–20:55)
- Goal
  - Create a more locked, stable variation of kosoto by gluing your calf to theirs.

- Key concepts
  - Calf-to-calf contact locks their leg so it cannot step out.
  - You still rely on the same overhook control and step-around mechanics.
  - Throw angle is more directly backward, giving a strong pinning finish.

- Positional landmarks
  - Double overhooks locked; you’ve stepped around to their back line.
  - Your calf is pressed directly against theirs, almost shin-to-shin from the rear.
  - Both of you facing the same general direction before you drop.

- Mechanics & details
  - Step deep so your calf is fully behind and against their calf.
  - Slightly flex the knee to “hook” behind their knee line, not just the ankle.
  - Pull shoulders back while driving hips forward to bring their weight onto the trapped leg.
  - Drop your weight and rotate them over that fixed point.
  - Land with your chest covering their chest or upper torso; arms still controlling.

- Coaching cues
  - “Calf glued to calf” – no daylight between the lower legs.
  - “Trap the knee line, not just the heel.”
  - “Pull with the upper body, reap with the lower body.”

- Common errors
  - Staying too shallow and only catching the heel.
  - Not aligning your hips, so you twist their knee instead of cleanly toppling them.
  - Letting go of the overhooks during the fall.

6.5 Uki Waza Lateral Drop from Double Overhooks (20:55–24:21)
- Goal
  - Use a sacrifice-style lateral drop when they drive in hard against your overhooks.

- Key concepts
  - Use their forward pressure as the engine of the throw.
  - Fall to your side, not your back, so you stay on top or in a dominant scramble.
  - Control their posting arm(s) via the overhooks and head/shoulder rotation.

- Positional landmarks
  - Double overhooks, opponent driving in or trying to lift.
  - Your hips slightly back but ready to drop under them.
  - Your throwing-side hip is close to their hip.

- Mechanics & details
  - Encourage them to drive: pull slightly in, then redirect.
  - Step in with the foot on the throwing side, placing your hip close to theirs.
  - Sit/fall to the side, not straight back, rotating so their shoulder heads toward the mat.
  - Use the overhooks to pull their upper body over you, lifting with the head turn.
  - Keep at least one overhook as you land to control top position or immediate follow-up.

- Coaching cues
  - “Side, not back” – lateral drop angle, not straight sacrifice.
  - “Let him push, then disappear.”
  - “Turn your head to throw the shoulder.”

- Common errors
  - Falling straight back and ending in a 50/50 scramble.
  - Not stepping in close enough – you end up dragging instead of throwing.
  - Loosening the overhooks mid-fall and letting them post.

6.6 Double Underhooks – Understanding Double Underhooks (24:21–33:16)
- Goal
  - Understand the offensive strengths of double underhooks/body lock and how to structure throws from there.

- Key concepts
  - Control of both sides of their body and, critically, the lumbar region.
  - Putting their shoulders behind their hips is the central off-balancing theme.
  - Body lock is extremely reliable in sweaty, late-match situations where other grips slip.

- Positional landmarks
  - Your arms are under both of theirs, hands locked around their torso.
  - Head tight to chest/shoulder; hips in, back straight.
  - Their feet still on the floor but balance compromised as you start to arch.

- Mechanics & details
  - “Clamp and curl” – tighten the body lock and curl them in so hips come to you.
  - Use small steps to walk their shoulders behind their heels.
  - Keep your head tight – no space for them to pummel or spin.
  - Prepare to chain into step-around trips, backbend takedowns, or ken ken entries.

- Coaching cues
  - “Hands locked beats slippery opponents.”
  - “Hips in, chest up.”
  - “Move their shoulders behind their hips.”

- Common errors
  - Standing too tall so they underhook you back or pummel out.
  - Letting your hips drift away so the lock becomes weak.
  - Trying big throws without first moving their weight onto one leg.

6.7 Step-Around Kosoto from Double Underhooks (33:16–39:33)
- Goal
  - Apply an outside trip while maintaining a strong body lock.

- Key concepts
  - Same kosoto mechanics, but now with the strongest possible upper-body control.
  - Emphasis on turning their shoulders and “pinning” them with the body lock as they fall.

- Positional landmarks
  - Double underhooks locked, head tight.
  - One of their legs is targeted as the reaped leg; weight shifted onto it.
  - Your stepping leg passes behind their heel line.

- Mechanics & details
  - Pull them slightly forward and toward the target leg to load their weight.
  - Step your outside leg behind theirs, heel-to-heel or slightly deeper.
  - As you reap, rotate your torso to turn their back toward the mat.
  - Maintain body lock throughout; follow them down into top control (often half guard/passing position).

- Coaching cues
  - “Body lock then reap.”
  - “Turn the shoulders as you trip.”
  - “Stay glued – don’t reach with your upper body.”

- Common errors
  - Reaping without first loading their weight onto the leg.
  - Letting the body lock slip to one side and losing chest contact.
  - Overstepping so you end up off-balance when they fall.

6.8 Calf-to-Calf Kosoto from Double Underhooks (39:33–19:19 – time misprint; later section)
- Goal
  - Apply a very stable outside trip from body lock with maximum leg control.

- Key concepts
  - Calf-to-calf contact prevents their leg from escaping.
  - Body lock controls their torso while the legs act as a fixed hinge.

- Positional landmarks
  - Double underhooks/body lock.
  - Your calf pressed firmly behind their calf on the target leg.
  - Their base narrowed, weight committed.

- Mechanics & details
  - Walk them until they take a short, narrow step with the target leg.
  - Slide your calf directly behind theirs; clamp by flexing your knee.
  - Arch and rotate so their hips and shoulders go over the trapped leg.
  - Fall with them in a controlled way, keeping the body lock until you pin or pass.

- Coaching cues
  - “Trap the whole leg, not just ankle.”
  - “Narrow their base, then reap.”
  - “Keep your lock; don’t open your hands in mid-throw.”

- Common errors
  - Going calf-to-calf before you’ve narrowed their stance.
  - Keeping your knee too straight, so the leg can slip out.
  - Throwing only with upper body and not rotating your hips.

6.9 Back Bend Takedown from Double Underhooks (19:19–22:32)
- Goal
  - Have a low-athleticism, high-control takedown option from the body lock.

- Key concepts
  - Simple step forward and backbend – no hopping, no big reaps.
  - Ideal for less mobile or older athletes and for safe training-room takedowns.

- Positional landmarks
  - Strong body lock around their torso, head tight.
  - They are resisting, making themselves heavy and stiff.
  - Your stance is slightly staggered, ready to step.

- Mechanics & details
  - Suck their hips in, putting their weight on your body.
  - Step your lead leg deep between theirs into a lunge, keeping chest up.
  - Arch back (“back bend”) while dropping your rear or lead knee toward the mat.
  - Use the arch and step to pull their hips past their heels so they tip backward.
  - Land with your knee on the mat and their back on the floor, still in body lock, then transition to pin.

- Coaching cues
  - “Step deep, then bend.”
  - “Shoulders behind hips = fall.”
  - “Smooth, not explosive.”

- Common errors
  - Trying to throw without a deep enough step.
  - Dropping straight down without arching, so they just sag on top of you.
  - Letting your head float away from their chest (space to pummel).

6.10 Ken Ken Uchi Mata from Double Underhooks (22:32–53:08)
- Goal
  - Use a hopping uchi mata from body lock to finish strong takedowns into passing positions.

- Key concepts
  - Uchi mata leg lifts between their legs while the other leg hops.
  - Body lock maximises control and prevents spin-outs.
  - Finish with your throwing leg landing between their legs to avoid being rolled through.

- Positional landmarks
  - Double underhooks/body lock, head tight on one side.
  - One of their legs becomes the “inside” leg you’ll lift.
  - Your hips are already in, close to theirs.

- Mechanics & details
  - Pull them slightly off-balance to the throwing side to expose the target leg.
  - Insert your uchi mata leg deep between their thighs, thigh contact high.
  - Lock your hands tight and begin small, tight hops on the support leg, circling toward their base.
  - Use the hops to progressively remove their posts and force their weight onto the lifted leg.
  - As they go over, land with your uchi mata leg between their legs, hips facing down into a strong top position (often half guard/passing).

- Coaching cues
  - “Leg in, then hop.”
  - “Small hops, big rotation.”
  - “Land with your leg between theirs.”

- Common errors
  - Trying to throw with a single big lift instead of progressive hopping.
  - Leaving your throwing leg outside their legs (easier for them to roll you).
  - Letting your chest drift away from the body lock during the hops.

6.11 Uki Goshi (Hip Throw) from Double Underhooks (53:08–56:03)
- Goal
  - Apply a classic hip throw using the body lock as the control mechanism.

- Key concepts
  - Same body lock; you step across to load them onto your hip.
  - Emphasis on getting your hip across the line of their feet.

- Positional landmarks
  - Double underhooks locked, stance slightly staggered.
  - Their weight is being drawn forward and slightly to the throwing side.
  - Your hip is primed to step all the way across in front of their center.

- Mechanics & details
  - Pull them forward so they step; as they step, turn and insert your hip in front of theirs.
  - Lock your feet roughly perpendicular to theirs; your belt line across their pelvis.
  - Lift slightly with your thighs/hips while rotating with the upper body.
  - Guide them over your hip in an arc to the mat.

- Coaching cues
  - “Hip across the line.”
  - “Turn, then lift.”
  - “Throw with the hip, steer with the lock.”

- Common errors
  - Starting to turn before you’ve truly loaded them onto your hip.
  - Keeping your hips too far from theirs, so they slide off.
  - Forgetting to rotate your head and shoulders toward the throw.

6.12 High-Lock Uki Goshi (56:03–1:02:19)
- Goal
  - Use a higher body lock (around upper ribs/chest) to create a powerful, upright hip throw.

- Key concepts
  - High lock gives more shoulder control and rotational torque.
  - Works well when you’ve climbed your hands up from a lower body lock.

- Positional landmarks
  - Hands locked high on their torso, near armpits/upper ribs.
  - Their posture somewhat upright; your chest tight to theirs.
  - Feet in close, ready to pivot.

- Mechanics & details
  - From the high lock, pull them slightly up and onto your toes, then step across.
  - Turn so your hip cuts in front of theirs while your lock lifts their ribs.
  - Rotate your torso aggressively, using the high lock as a steering wheel.
  - Finish with them rotating over your hip and landing flat.

- Coaching cues
  - “Climb the lock, then throw.”
  - “Lift with the lock, turn with the hips.”
  - “Keep elbows tight; don’t let the grip slide down.”

- Common errors
  - Letting the high lock drift down to mid-torso during the turn.
  - Failing to step deep enough, resulting in a side bump rather than a hip throw.
  - Over-bending at the waist instead of turning the whole body.

6.13 Tai Otoshi High Lock (1:02:19–1:05:44)
- Goal
  - Combine a high body lock with a blocking leg to execute tai otoshi.

- Key concepts
  - Unlike hip throws, your hips do not fully turn under; the leg becomes a barrier.
  - High lock controls their upper body; the blocking leg removes their base.

- Positional landmarks
  - High body lock, chest to chest.
  - Your lead leg ready to step across and slightly in front of their near leg.
  - Their weight slightly forward and to the side of the blocking leg.

- Mechanics & details
  - Rotate and step across so your blocking leg is straight and slightly bent at the knee line.
  - Keep your hips back relative to classic hip throws; you’re blocking, not loading.
  - Pull and twist their upper body over the blocking leg, dropping your weight slightly.
  - Aim to rotate them so they fly over the leg and land flat.

- Coaching cues
  - “Block with the leg, throw with the upper body.”
  - “Leg is a bar, not a reap.”
  - “High lock steers the fall.”

- Common errors
  - Bending the blocking leg too much, turning it into a weak reap.
  - Not turning enough with the upper body so they simply step around your leg.
  - Standing too tall; you need a modest level change to make the block effective.

6.14 Sasae Foot Sweep (1:05:44+)
- Goal
  - Use a forward-prop foot sweep from the high lock when they step around or resist other throws.

- Key concepts
  - Sasae works when they step and bear weight on the stepping leg.
  - High lock redirects their upper body while your foot blocks and lifts the ankle.

- Positional landmarks
  - High body lock, they are stepping forward or circling.
  - You time the sweep as their foot is about to take weight.
  - Your sweeping foot targets just above the ankle on the front/side of their shin.

- Mechanics & details
  - Encourage a step by pulling or circling them.
  - As their foot lands, place your foot on the front/side of their ankle/shin.
  - Simultaneously pull their upper body over the blocked foot and slightly down.
  - Keep your own base slightly back so you don’t fall with them.

- Coaching cues
  - “Catch the step, don’t chase the leg.”
  - “Upper body pulls, foot blocks.”
  - “Small, sharp sweep – not a big kick.”

- Common errors
  - Trying to sweep after the foot is fully weighted.
  - Kicking too hard and losing balance.
  - Forgetting to pull with the high lock (no upper-body off-balance).
