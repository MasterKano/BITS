# Viewing Notes – Standing to Ground 3 – Volume 4 (Sumi Gaeshi & Ude Gaeshi)

## 4.1 Special Study: Sumi Gaeshi – Whizzer and Wrist vs Single Leg (0:00–10:40)

- Goal
  - Use Sumi Gaeshi as a high-percentage counter to a single leg by combining:
    - A whizzer on the outside arm, and
    - Correct wrist control to remove their main post.

- Core scenario
  - Opponent attacks single leg (standing or on a knee).
  - Your outside arm (same side as trapped leg) becomes a whizzer.
  - Same-side hand controls the wrist of that outside arm.

- Key mechanical themes
  - Correct wrist:
    - Always grab the wrist of the arm on the outside of your body.
    - If you grab the inside arm, they can still post with the outside arm and stop the throw.
  - Two posts to remove:
    - Their outside hand (wrist you’re gripping).
    - Their outside foot (the foot you will throw past).
  - Directionality:
    - Throw along the line of their toes, not straight back.
    - If you fall straight back, you pull guard into their post; if you hop across the line of the toes, you remove the foot as a post.

- Foot and hop details
  - Your free foot steps/hops so that:
    - It crosses in front of, and inside, their outside foot.
    - Think of your shoelaces jumping past the line of both of their ankles.
  - Body does a small quarter turn as you hop:
    - Hips and shoulders turn so you are more across their body than directly in front.

- Upper body and head position
  - Head close to their head:
    - The closer your head is to theirs, the stronger the connection.
    - If your head drifts away, the linkage is weak and the throw loses power.
  - Whizzer:
    - Shallow but tight.
    - Acts like a strap pulling their upper body over you when you drop.

- Landing and follow-up
  - Aim to land with chest higher than theirs:
    - Immediately sit up so your chest is above theirs.
    - Underhook appears naturally; transition directly to side pin or mount.
  - If they keep a “death grip” on your leg:
    - You often land straight into mount.
  - If they let go:
    - You usually land in a strong side pin.

- Key cues
  - “Correct wrist, correct direction” – outside wrist and along the line of the toes.
  - “Jump past the ankle line” – your foot must go past their feet, not stop next to them.


## 4.2 Lat and Wrist vs Single Leg (10:40–15:07)

- Goal
  - Present a more secure, slip-resistant grip combination for Sumi Gaeshi against single leg, emphasising lat and wrist control.

- Problem being solved
  - Under sweat, grips can slip:
    - If your hand slides off the body mid-throw, you may fall with no upper-body control.
  - You need a grip configuration that:
    - Holds even if they let go of your leg.
    - Maintains a powerful “strap” across their upper body.

- Grip configuration
  - One hand on the wrist (still the correct outside wrist).
  - Other arm wraps deeper, connecting into lat/upper back (“lat and wrist”).
  - Together:
    - The wrist grip removes the post.
    - The lat grip keeps their torso attached to you through the throw.

- Mechanical implications
  - Even if they release the single leg mid-air:
    - You still maintain two-on-one style control of the arm and upper body.
    - You can finish the throw cleanly into a pin.
  - Less chance of “slipping out” at the crucial moment:
    - The lat connection is harder to lose than a shallow body grab.

- Direction and footwork
  - Direction remains the same as previous section:
    - Hop across so your throwing foot points along the line of their toes.
  - Same emphasis on:
    - Removing outside hand as a post.
    - Jumping foot past their ankle line.

- Comparison to whizzer + wrist alone
  - Whizzer + wrist:
    - Very strong, but more vulnerable to slipping if contact on the torso is shallow.
  - Lat + wrist:
    - Slightly more mechanical complexity to set up.
    - Better insurance against slippage in long, sweaty matches.

- Viewing focus
  - Watch how the wrist and lat grips stay connected even if he hypothetically lets go of the leg.
  - Observe that directionality and hop mechanics do not change; only the upper-body connection gets an upgrade.


## 4.3 Chest Wrap Sumi Gaeshi vs Double Leg (15:07–21:05)

- Goal
  - Adapt Sumi Gaeshi to defend a double leg, using a chest wrap configuration instead of a classic whizzer.

- Core scenario
  - Opponent shoots a double leg, gets deep on both legs.
  - You cannot simply shuffle out; you need a throw that turns their shot into a takedown for you.

- Key position
  - Chest wrap:
    - Arm passes over their back and wraps around chest/lat area.
    - Other arm controls wrist / elbow to limit posting.
  - Head position:
    - Head close to opponent’s head or shoulder line for a strong connection.

- Mechanics
  - From the double:
    - You establish chest wrap and wrist/arm control.
    - Step your throwing foot in deep, across the line of their toes.
    - Drop underneath in Sumi Gaeshi fashion, projecting them forward in the direction they are driving.
  - Legs:
    - One leg acts as pivot/drive.
    - Other leg slides in as the blocking/throwing leg that lifts them over.

- Landing and finishes
  - Aim for:
    - Strong side pin if they release the legs.
    - Mount or near-mount if they persist gripping the legs.
  - Immediate requirement:
    - Sit up quickly, get chest higher than their chest, and use underhook/head control to stabilise.

- Theme
  - “Use their commitment to the double against them.”
  - The more they drive, the more energy feeds into the Sumi Gaeshi direction.


4.4 Butterfly Sumi Gaeshi vs Double Leg (21:05–25:17)

- Goal
  - Add a butterfly-hook-based Sumi Gaeshi option versus the double leg, providing more lift and control.

- Scenario
  - Opponent on a double; your hips are partly in front.
  - You have the chance to insert a butterfly hook instead of pure “shin block” style.

- Main mechanics
  - Butterfly hook:
    - Instep or shin placed high inside their thigh/hip.
    - Used to elevate and spin them as you fall.
  - Upper body:
    - Chest wrap or strong over/under style grips to anchor them to you.
  - Drop:
    - Simultaneously fall back/diagonal while lifting with the butterfly.
    - Throwing direction is still aligned with their head/pressure line.

- Benefits vs standard chest-wrapped Sumi Gaeshi
  - More lift:
    - Hook exaggerates amplitude of the throw.
  - Recoveries:
    - Easier to adjust mid-air using the hook if balance or angle is slightly off.
  - Finishing options:
    - Strong transitions to mount, back exposure or high pins as you follow the lift.

- Key cues
  - “Hook then fall, not fall then hook.”
    - Butterfly must be set before you commit to the drop.
  - “Lift along the line of the shot.”
    - Use their forward pressure to feed the lift, not fight against it.


## 4.5 Sumi Gaeshi vs High Crotch (25:17–29:27)

- Goal
  - Apply Sumi Gaeshi concepts to high-crotch style single legs by re-identifying the “correct” outside arm and direction.

- Scenario
  - Opponent switches from standard single to high crotch:
    - Changes side of head.
    - Changes leg position and angle.

- Key adaptation
  - Correct posting arm changes:
    - The outside arm relative to your torso may switch depending on head and body position.
  - Principle remains:
    - Identify which arm can post in the direction you will throw.
    - That arm is the one you must control at the wrist.

- Mechanics
  - Whizzer or wrap on the outside arm as before.
  - Wrist control on the correct outside arm (high crotch adjusted).
  - Same hop and Sumi direction:
    - Throw along the line of their toes.
    - Jump across so your throwing foot passes their ankle line.

- Emphasis
  - “High crotch changes which side is outside.”
    - You adapt the side on which you place whizzer and wrist control accordingly.
  - The throw is structurally similar if you re-map which arm is the true post.


## 4.6 Yoko Sumi Gaeshi on the Mat (29:27–34:12)

- Goal
  - Introduce Yoko Sumi Gaeshi as a mat-based, more lateral variant of Sumi Gaeshi.

- Scenario
  - Both players lower to the mat:
    - Shot that stalls on the knees.
    - Front headlock or single-leg positions transitioning onto the floor.
  - You are not purely standing; you use mat contact to assist the throw.

- Direction and mechanics
  - “Yoko” emphasis:
    - More lateral angle than classical straight-line Sumi.
    - You roll to the side as you throw, not straight back.
  - Leg position:
    - Inside leg or hook acts as the main lifting/tripping element.
    - Other leg helps steer and maintain balance on the mat.
  - Upper body:
    - Head and arm control persists; you do not sacrifice grip quality just because you are lower.

- Finishing focus
  - Aim to:
    - Roll through into a dominant top position.
    - Prevent them from re-guarding or coming up in the scramble.
  - The throw should blend naturally into:
    - Pin sequences.
    - Potential back-take routes if they expose the back on the way down.


## 4.7 2 on 1 Yoko Sumi Gaeshi (34:12–39:03)

- Goal
  - Use a 2-on-1 control to drive Yoko Sumi Gaeshi, especially when both players are low or on the mat.

- Setup
  - Secure 2-on-1 on one of their arms:
    - Two hands controlling one of their arms.
  - Often from:
    - Hand-fighting sequences.
    - Situations where you have already broken them down to a knee or hip.

- Mechanics
  - With 2-on-1:
    - Their posting arm on that side is disabled.
    - You can easily pull and rotate their upper body toward the throwing direction.
  - Legs:
    - Inside hook or shin engages as you roll sideways.
    - Your body follows in a “Yoko” roll rather than a pure backward fall.

- Finish
  - Because the arm is trapped, they have difficulty posting even if angle is not perfect.
  - Land with:
    - Arm still controlled.
    - Chest over torso or back.
  - Transition immediately into pins or back exposure.

- Key cue
  - “Trap the posting arm, then roll sideways.”
    - The 2-on-1 ensures posting is gone; the Yoko direction ensures they cannot turn and square up.


## 4.8 Arm Drag Sumi Gaeshi (39:03–44:09)

- Goal
  - Tie Sumi Gaeshi into the arm-drag family so that failed back-takes or leg attacks convert into sacrifice throws.

- Scenario
  - You secure an arm drag in standup or from a low, scrambly exchange.
  - You cannot get behind or clearly to the legs; opponent squares up.

- Mechanics
  - Maintain tight arm-drag control:
    - Elbow pulled across your centre line.
    - Shoulder rotated past you.
  - As they resist and square:
    - Insert your throwing leg inside.
    - Drop into a Sumi Gaeshi path, using the dragged arm as your “post removal” and steering handle.
  - Direction:
    - Again, follow the line of their head and stance.
    - Use their square-up movement to feed into the throw.

- Finish
  - Land with the arm still controlled.
  - Move directly into:
    - Pins.
    - Transitions to the back if they start to turn away.

- Training implication
  - Any time an arm drag stalls, you have:
    - Option A: keep chasing the back.
    - Option B: convert to arm-drag Sumi Gaeshi if angle and stance align.


## 4.9 Special Study: Ude Gaeshi – Mechanics (44:09–50:28)

- Goal
  - Understand Ude Gaeshi as an arm-based sacrifice throw and how its mechanics differ from leg-based Sumi Gaeshi.

- Structural idea
  - “Ude” focus:
    - Arm is the main lever and control line.
    - You load them over the captured arm rather than primarily over the leg.
  - You still:
    - Sacrifice bodyweight.
    - Use one leg to guide/steer.
    - Aim to land on top.

- Key mechanical elements
  - Arm line:
    - Elbow and wrist must be tightly controlled.
    - Your grip placement prevents them from rotating the arm free during the throw.
  - Shoulder control:
    - Rotate their shoulder so their torso is already tipping in your preferred direction before you drop.
  - Hips:
    - Hips come underneath and forward, not directly under their centre without angle.
    - Think of “bringing your hips under the arm/shoulder” rather than under the belt line.

- Direction
  - As with Sumi:
    - You throw in the direction their head and arm line are pointing, not at ninety degrees.
  - Ude Gaeshi emphasises:
    - Turning them over the trapped arm.
    - Preventing them from rolling their shoulder out.

- Landing
  - You should land:
    - With their arm still trapped.
    - Chest on their chest or chest on their upper torso.
  - Often creates:
    - Strong opportunities for upper-body pins.
    - Potential submission transitions due to compromised arm position.

- Key cues
  - “Control elbow and shoulder together.”
  - “Drop under the arm line, not just under the hips.”


## 4.10 Ude Gaeshi Application (50:28–54:38)

- Goal
  - Show concrete situations where Ude Gaeshi is applied in actual standup/fighting contexts.

- Typical entry scenarios
  - From failed shots:
    - Opponent’s head low, arm extended in defence or grip.
  - From over/under or body lock:
    - One arm isolated in front of you while head and shoulders are aligned for a sacrifice.
  - From defensive frames:
    - Opponent using a strong arm frame across your body that can be turned into the lever.

- Application themes
  - You do not hunt Ude Gaeshi from nowhere:
    - You recognise when an arm is over-committed or poorly positioned.
    - You then attach to elbow/wrist and adjust stance.
  - Once you commit:
    - Full bodyweight goes under, using the trapped arm to ensure they cannot easily roll free.
    - Your leg and hip line direct them where you want them to land.

- Finishing habits
  - Never let go of the arm on landing until you are clearly on top and balanced.
  - Use the trapped arm to prevent them turning into you or away; build pins and transitions from there.


## 4.11 Ude Gaeshi Setups (54:38–59:16)

- Goal
  - Systematise the main setup routes into Ude Gaeshi.

- Setup families
  - Shot-related setups:
    - Opponent’s arm is extended in front of your torso after a shot or snap-down.
  - Tie-up setups:
    - Over/under exchanges where one arm drifts across your chest.
  - Defensive frame setups:
    - Opponent posts or frames strongly on your chest/shoulder:
      - Arm is straight or nearly straight.
      - Elbow is exposed as a lever.

- Design principle
  - Look for:
    - Extended arms.
    - Poor elbow alignment (elbow pointing away from structure).
    - Head and torso in a direction you can throw along.
  - Once identified:
    - You clamp elbow/wrist.
    - Step and adjust hips.
    - Then commit to the sacrifice.

- Training focus
  - Drill recognising setups first:
    - Without throwing, just identify “Ude Gaeshi available / not available”.
  - Then drill:
    - Attach-and-throw sequences:
      - Grip.
      - Step.
      - Sacrifice.
      - Immediate top stabilisation.


## 4.12 Mistakes to Avoid (59:16+)

- Goal
  - Highlight recurring error patterns for Sumi Gaeshi / Yoko Sumi and Ude Gaeshi.

- Sumi Gaeshi / Yoko Sumi
  - Throwing in the wrong direction:
    - Falling straight back into their post instead of along the toes/head line.
  - Failing to remove the post:
    - Grabbing the wrong wrist on single leg / high crotch.
    - Not blocking the stepping foot.
  - Staying flat:
    - Not sitting up to get chest higher than theirs on landing.
    - Ending side-by-side and allowing scrambles.

- Ude Gaeshi
  - Poor arm line control:
    - Elbow not truly captured.
    - Wrist slipping during the throw.
  - Dropping under hips, not arm line:
    - You end up under their centre with no leverage on the arm.
  - Half commitment:
    - Not fully sacrificing bodyweight, leading to awkward collisions instead of clean throws.

- Global themes
  - Wrong direction + incomplete post removal = failed sacrifice throw.
  - Failure to sit up and stabilise = scramble-heavy outcomes.
  - Solution:
    - Prioritise post removal, direction, and immediate top stabilisation in every rep.
