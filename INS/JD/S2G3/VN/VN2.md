## Viewing Notes – Standing to Ground 3 – Volume 2: Cow Catcher

### 2.1 Special Study: Cow Catcher Mechanics (0:00–13:01)

- Goal
  - Understand what the cow catcher is and why it is such a strong standing-to-pin transition.
- Core idea
  - Head-and-arm control: chin strap/head control on one side + underhook on the far side, lifting the shoulder and turning the head.
  - Use this to control the opponent’s head and shoulders through the fall and into a pin, rather than just “throwing” and hoping to land well.
- Key positional details
  - Chin strap: palm under the jaw, wrist tight, elbow tucked; keep their head turned and slightly down.
  - Underhook: deep, lifting the far-side shoulder; keep your elbow tight and forearm wrapping up the back/lat.
  - Your stance: feet spread enough to drop and rotate; hips close, chest tight to their shoulder line.
- Direction of force
  - Rotate them over the underhook side while pulling the head down and across.
  - Keep the throw compact – hips close, not a long, stretched-out arc.
- Finishing emphasis
  - Do not relax on landing: immediately turn the head away, walk the underhook up the body, and settle chest-to-chest or chest-to-back.
  - Aim to land in clear scoring positions (pins / back exposure), not just “somewhere on top”.
- Failure patterns to watch for
  - Lose chin control in the middle of the throw – they turn out or turtle.
  - Shallow underhook – their shoulder slips and they square up on landing.
  - Over-rotating and rolling yourself underneath during the finish.


### 2.2 Two Approaches to the Cow Catcher (13:01–18:20)

- Goal
  - Learn the two main entry routes and when each is easier to obtain.
- Two main entry types
  - Head-first entry
    - Start with front headlock / chin strap, then fight to get an underhook on the far side.
    - Strong when you already have the head (e.g., from snap down).
  - Waist-first entry
    - Start with tight waist/body lock on one side, then bring the head down and feed into the cow catcher.
    - Strong when you already have a body lock or are behind/side-on.
- Pros / cons (high level)
  - Head-first
    - Pro: you are already attacking the neck; clear front headlock threat.
    - Con: must win the battle under the far-side elbow; if opponent is disciplined with elbow position it can be difficult.
  - Waist-first
    - Pro: once you have angle and waist control, bringing the head down is relatively easy.
    - Con: you may have to work harder to initially get behind/around to the waist.
- Key cues
  - Head-first: “Win the elbow.” You must get your arm under their far elbow to connect the underhook.
  - Waist-first: “Bump the hips, then drop the head.” Use off-balancing and angle to expose the head.
- Teaching emphasis
  - Train both pathways so that any existing control (front headlock or tight waist) can be turned into a cow catcher rather than abandoned.


### 2.3 Go Behind Setups (18:20–24:19)

- Goal
  - Use go-behind attempts from front headlock to force predictable defenses that open cow catcher entries.
- Initial scenario
  - You have front headlock; opponent is on knees or bent over.
  - You threaten to go behind (reach for the far hip or leg).
- Typical defensive reaction
  - Opponent reaches with the far arm across to catch your leg/hip and block the go-behind.
  - That reaching arm position creates a window for the underhook and cow catcher.
- Key mechanics
  - Start the go-behind in a believable way: step to the side, pivot, reach for the hip/leg.
  - As the arm reaches across, feed your arm under their armpit/far side → underhook.
  - Combine underhook insertion with head control: re-clamp chin strap and step your hips in.
- Positional checkpoints
  - Your head is on the underhook side, close to their jaw/temple.
  - Their elbow is elevated or at least no longer barring your entry; you “win the inside” with the underhook.
  - Once the frame is broken, turn and drop into the cow catcher line.
- Failure patterns
  - Faint, lazy go-behind that doesn’t trigger a real defensive reaction.
  - Reaching for the underhook with your elbow flared – get whizzed or front headlocked in return.
- Viewing focus
  - Watch exactly when he switches from “threatening the go-behind” to “committing to the underhook/cow catcher”.
  - Note his footwork during that switch – it is not just upper-body: there is always a small angle-change step.


### 2.4 Elbow-Based Reactions (24:19–26:57)

- Goal
  - Build a decision tree based on where the opponent’s far elbow is.
- Two main elbow behaviours
  - Elbow flares out
    - Easier to slide the underhook in.
    - You climb from the elbow up to the shoulder and then combine with chin control.
  - Elbow stays tight
    - Underhook is blocked.
    - You may redirect to alternative attacks or adjust angle/level first.
- Key tactical ideas
  - “Elbow out, I go in.” Use the gap to insert underhook and link to cow catcher.
  - “Elbow tight, I move his base.” Off-balance first: snap, turn, or bump hips so the elbow must open.
- Positional details
  - Head position: keep your head on the underhook side; do not leave your neck exposed while chasing the arm.
  - Hand fighting: peel their posting hand / elbow line before diving for the underhook.
- Failure patterns
  - Forcing the underhook when the elbow is locked to the ribs – leads to whizzers and stalled ties.
  - Moving your feet late; trying to solve an elbow problem with only your arms.
- Viewing focus
  - Track the opponent’s elbow in the demonstrations: what exactly changes when it flares vs when it clamps?
  - Note how he never just “tries harder” with the same entry – he changes angle or direction before re-entering.


### 2.5 Roll Through (26:57–33:47)

- Goal
  - Learn how to continue the attack when the initial cow catcher attempt rolls through rather than landing directly in a stable pin.
- Core scenario
  - You enter cow catcher correctly but the fall leads to a rolling scramble rather than an immediate settled top.
- Key mechanics
  - Keep the head and far-side shoulder controlled throughout the roll – do not let the chin strap and underhook separate.
  - Roll in the direction that preserves your inside position (head and underhook on the “inside track” of the turn).
  - Use your legs to steer: hook or windshield-wiper your legs so that you land in a strong pin, not with both knees together and narrow.
- Finishing positions
  - Chest-to-chest pin after multiple rolls.
  - Chest-to-back or near-turtle breakdown where you can flatten them.
- Safety / control points
  - Keep your own head high and close; do not let your neck hang behind them.
  - Avoid extending your arms during the roll – keep everything tight and compact.
- Failure patterns
  - Letting the head pop out during the roll – opponent comes up on top.
  - Rolling “around” the opponent instead of through them – you lose connection and scramble.
- Viewing focus
  - Pay attention to how he keeps the head “glued” to his ribs and the underhook elbow tight while rotating.
  - Watch where his knees and feet land on each repetition of the roll-through.


### 2.6 Standing Up Defense – Yoko Sumi Gaeshi (33:47–41:53)

- Goal
  - Add Yoko Sumi Gaeshi as a second-line attack when the opponent stands up to escape your cow catcher/front headlock.
- Typical scenario
  - You have front headlock or are transitioning toward cow catcher.
  - Opponent starts to stand up or straighten the legs to escape pressure.
- Throw concept
  - Lateral sacrifice throw: sit/roll to the side while loading their weight over your hip/back.
  - Use your grips (head/arm or head/lat) to pull them over the blocking leg.
- Key mechanics
  - Step and angle so their weight is already drifting in the direction of the throw before you sit.
  - Insert your leg/hip as the fulcrum; keep your knee close to their far leg/hip, not dangling.
  - Pull the head and upper body diagonally, not straight sideways – think “diagonal down” rather than pure lateral.
- Follow-up on landing
  - Immediately come up into top position: either pin or back exposure.
  - Keep head control – do not release the chin until you have proper upper-body control on the mat.
- Failure patterns
  - Sitting straight down without pre-breaking balance – they simply step over or spin.
  - Sacrificing your body without controlling the head and far side – they turn and come up on top.
- Viewing focus
  - Note exactly when during the opponent’s stand-up he chooses to initiate the Yoko Sumi – not too early, not too late.
  - Watch the angle of his sit: it is more diagonal/backward than sideways.


### 2.7 Ouchi Gari (41:53–48:04)

- Goal
  - Use Ouchi Gari as an auxiliary throw when the opponent’s leg becomes available during cow catcher / front headlock exchanges.
- Entry triggers
  - Opponent steps too close with the near leg while defending the head/arm.
  - Balance is already compromised from snap downs, go-behind threats, or Yoko Sumi threats.
- Basic mechanics
  - Maintain strong upper-body control (head + underhook / collar tie).
  - Step your reaping leg inside their near leg and reap backward along the mat.
  - Drive with upper body in the direction of the reap – head and shoulders turn them as the leg is removed.
- Integration with cow catcher system
  - Use Ouchi when the head/arm threat is causing them to overreact with their stance.
  - Think of it as a “clean-up throw” when they lean heavily toward the underhook side to stay upright.
- Finishing emphasis
  - Land already chest-to-chest; keep the top knee tight, bottom knee free to move and adjust.
  - Keep the head turned away; do not allow them to face back toward you on impact.
- Failure patterns
  - Reaping too shallow – your foot just taps their ankle and they step out.
  - Trying to reap without sufficient upper-body off-balance; the leg reaps but they can post and recover.
- Viewing focus
  - Watch the relationship between his upper-body pull and timing of the reap – it’s one combined action, not two separate steps.


### 2.8 Shot Stop to Cow Catcher (48:04–55:26)

- Goal
  - Turn successful shot defense into immediate cow catcher entries instead of stopping and resetting.
- Initial scenario
  - Opponent shoots single/double/high crotch.
  - You defend with sprawl/hips and obtain front headlock or strong upper-body tie.
- Conversion steps
  - Sprawl and stuff the head; secure chin strap and inside position with your arms.
  - Bring them to their knees or down to a lower base while maintaining head control.
  - Move to the side, begin the go-behind threat, then connect to the cow catcher entries (head-first pathway).
- Key cues
  - “Do not let go of the head.” The moment you win the shot defense, you are already in the setup for cow catcher.
  - Immediately angle off rather than staying square in front once the shot stalls.
- Finishing direction
  - Same cow catcher mechanics: head + underhook, turn and drop to pin.
- Failure patterns
  - Winning the sprawl but backing away to reset instead of converting to an attack.
  - Staying square in front and giving them a chance to stand or reshoot before you angle off.
- Viewing focus
  - Track the sequence: sprawl → head control → angle → cow catcher. Note how quickly he commits to offense once the shot is stopped.


### 2.9 Waist-First Entry (55:26–1:03:08)

- Goal
  - Develop entries where you start with tight waist control and then feed into the cow catcher.
- Starting positions
  - Tight waist from the side or slightly behind while opponent is bent over or on knees.
  - Body lock variations where the near arm wraps around the waist.
- Mechanics
  - Use bumps with your hips to disturb their balance and create angle.
  - As they react, bring their head down with snaps, pulls, or circling.
  - Once the head drops, thread your arm over/around to establish chin control, then insert the underhook and complete the cow catcher.
- Key strategic idea
  - When you already own the waist, the head is “waiting to be taken” – you do not have to fight as hard for an underhook from front headlock.
- Footwork
  - Circle to place yourself slightly to the side, not directly behind.
  - Step in so your hips are tight before you feed the head down.
- Failure patterns
  - Trying to pull the head down while standing too far away – no leverage.
  - Staying square behind the opponent; you cannot create a good throwing line from directly behind.
- Viewing focus
  - Watch how every hip bump or step is used to make the head line more accessible – nothing is random movement.


### 2.10 Drilling Scene (1:03:08+)

- Goal
  - See how all the cow catcher components are combined in live-feeling drilling sequences.
- Drilling themes
  - Repeating entries from snap downs into cow catcher, roll-through, and pins.
  - Alternating between chin-strap-first and waist-first entries depending on which control is available.
  - Using Yoko Sumi Gaeshi and Ouchi Gari as second-line options when the initial cow catcher route is blocked.
  - Converting defended shots into immediate front headlock → cow catcher attacks.
- What to watch for
  - Pace: how quickly he transitions from one attempt to the next when something is shut down.
  - Connection: he never completely disconnects from head/shoulders during transitions.
  - Direction changes: when the opponent resists in one direction, he redirects the throw instead of forcing it.
- How to use this section
  - As you watch, pause and sketch mini-drills:
    - Entry drill (snap down → cow catcher).
    - Reaction drill (go-behind → elbow reaction → cow catcher).
    - Second-line drill (opponent stands → Yoko Sumi / Ouchi).
    - Shot-stop drill (sprawl → head control → cow catcher).
  - These mini-drills can be turned directly into your 60-min sessions.
