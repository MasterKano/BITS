# VN S2G V5 – Overhook & Over/Under Throw Series

---

## 5.1 Throwing From the Overhook – Uki Goshi (Half Hip Throw) (0:00–6:17)

- Time
  - 0:00–6:17

- Goal
  - Understand how to turn a strong overhook (whizzer) into a compact half-hip throw that lands you in dominant top position.

- Key ideas
  - Overhook is not just defensive; it can be a primary throwing grip.
  - Your hip must get in front of, and slightly under, their hip line.
  - Head position and shoulder pressure decide whether they can limp-arm or turn away.
  - Small, tight rotational throw – not a big “hero” hip toss.

- Core mechanics
  - Stance & grips
    - Overhook their arm snugly, elbow glued to your ribs.
    - Opposite hand controls head/neck or lat, pulling their upper body over your hip.
    - Keep your forehead/side of head glued to their jaw/temple on the overhook side.
  - Kuzushi
    - Pull their overhooked shoulder slightly forward and down.
    - At the same time, drive your head into them to bend their spine.
  - Entry
    - Step your lead foot between their feet, toes turned slightly across their stance.
    - Pivot so your hips rotate in front of theirs (half-hip, not fully across).
    - Keep knees soft so you can “sit” them on your hip shelf.
  - Finish
    - Rotate your upper body like turning a wheel – overhook pulls, head-hand steers.
    - Drive your hip across and slightly up, popping them over.
    - Follow immediately into chest-to-chest control or a top pin (side control / kesa).

- Cues to remember
  - “Hip across first, throw second.”
  - “Overhook pulls the shoulder over the hip shelf.”
  - “Head wins the posture battle.”

- Links
  - Sets the basic overhook → hip-throw template that repeats in Uchi Mata, Harai Goshi, and later over-under versions.

- Your notes
  - (Write key phrases Danaher uses, plus any details that feel different for you vs Sam.)

## 5.2 Tai Otoshi (6:17–9:21)

- Time
  - 6:17–9:21

- Goal
  - Learn classic Tai Otoshi mechanics from overhook-style upper body control, with emphasis on footwork and direction of force.

- Key ideas
  - Tai Otoshi is a hand/upper-body throw with a blocking leg, not a hip throw.
  - The “one–two–three” step pattern is the backbone of the movement.
  - Your upper body rotation must align with the direction of the blocking leg.

- Core mechanics
  - Grips & posture
    - Maintain strong overhook and head/lat control or similar upper-grip.
    - Upright posture, knees slightly bent, weight evenly distributed.
  - Step pattern (“1–2–3”)
    - Step 1: off-line step to draw them forward/diagonal.
    - Step 2: pivot step to turn your torso across their line of travel.
    - Step 3: block leg steps across in front of both their feet, knee slightly bent.
  - Throw direction
    - Rotate your upper body like turning a big wheel in front of you.
    - Drive them over the blocking leg, not sideways away from it.
    - Keep your blocking leg relatively straight and rooted.

- Cues to remember
  - “Hands throw, leg blocks.”
  - “1–2–3, then drop the floor out from under them.”
  - “Rotate them over the bar, not around it.”

- Links
  - Builds the Tai Otoshi pattern you’ll reuse in one-handed Tai Otoshi and later underhook variants.

- Your notes
  - (Record which step tends to break down for you; note Sam/Jerry-specific fixes.)

---

## 5.3 One-Handed Tai Otoshi (9:21–11:57)

- Time
  - 9:21–11:57

- Goal
  - Adapt Tai Otoshi so that one arm does most of the throwing work while the free hand may post, then recover to control after impact.

- Key ideas
  - You can throw effectively with a single dominant arm if kuzushi and footwork are correct.
  - Free hand may briefly post to the mat to prevent self-fall or to adjust angle.
  - Post-throw priority: recover free hand to cover head/arm and secure top.

- Core mechanics
  - Setup
    - Use strong collar-tie/lat/overhook style control with your throwing arm.
    - Free hand is “available”: can check, post, or frame as you enter.
  - Entry & post
    - Maintain the same 1–2–3 step pattern as classic Tai Otoshi.
    - As you rotate, free hand may touch the mat to stabilize or help pivot.
    - Do not let the post pull your hips away from the throw – keep hips close.
  - Finish & follow-up
    - Throw direction remains the same: over the blocking leg.
    - As they land, immediately peel your posting hand off the floor.
    - Use that hand to cover head, underhook, or secure a front headlock/ride.

- Cues to remember
  - “Same Tai Otoshi, fewer hands.”
  - “Post, then recover – don’t leave the hand on the floor.”
  - “Throw first, post only to stabilize, not to save a bad angle.”

- Links
  - Connects directly to front headlock / top control transitions when they turn on landing.

- Your notes
  - (Note where you feel off-balance; note strategies for recovering grips quickly.)

---

## 5.4 Uchi Mata (11:57–22:01)

- Time
  - 11:57–22:01

- Goal
  - Build a high-percentage overhook-based Uchi Mata as a core upper-body throw in the system.

- Key ideas
  - Uchi Mata is the central “big score” throw in this suite.
  - Overhook + head position allow very strong inside-thigh reaps in no-gi.
  - Hopping on the base leg maintains balance and lifting force.

- Core mechanics
  - Grips & posture
    - Deep overhook, elbow tight, shoulder heavy on their shoulder.
    - Other hand controls head/neck or lat, keeping them folded.
    - Chest close; avoid extended arms.
  - Entry
    - Step across to place your hips in front of theirs (similar to Uki Goshi start).
    - Turn so your back is almost facing their armpit, maintaining overhook pressure.
  - Reap & lift
    - Reaping leg swings between their legs, lifting inner thigh.
    - Base foot hops in small circles to maintain balance and power.
    - Upper body lifts and rotates – think “up and over,” not just sideways.
  - Direction & finish
    - Drive them over the reaping leg in a diagonal front direction.
    - As they go down, follow with chest-to-chest or an immediate pass to top.

- Cues to remember
  - “Hip in deep, leg between, hop to finish.”
  - “Overhook pulls them onto the lifting thigh.”
  - “Head and chest glued – no long levers.”

- Links
  - Natural follow-on/variation from Uki Goshi when you need more lift.
  - Pairs with Harai Goshi when they widen their stance.

- Your notes
  - (Note tendencies: do you under-rotate, under-lift, or lose chest contact?)

---

## 5.5 Harai Goshi (22:01–25:48)

- Time
  - 22:01–25:48

- Goal
  - Learn Harai Goshi as a sweeping-hip complement to Uchi Mata from overhook ties.

- Key ideas
  - Same basic entry as Uchi Mata; difference is in leg line and stance of opponent.
  - Used when they widen stance or retreat the inside leg.
  - The sweeping leg contact is higher and more lateral.

- Core mechanics
  - Entry
    - Step and turn in as for Uchi Mata/Uki Goshi.
    - Ensure hips are fully across, with your belt line under their center.
  - Sweep
    - Swing your reaping leg across the outside of their far thigh/hip.
    - Keep sweeping leg relatively straight, using hip and torso rotation to power it.
  - Upper body
    - Overhook pulls and rotates; head control steers the load.
    - Slight backward lean as you sweep to generate a powerful arc.

- Cues to remember
  - “Same turn, wider sweep.”
  - “If they widen the base, sweep the far leg.”
  - “Hip across, leg as a broom.”

- Links
  - Switch choice between Uchi Mata vs Harai Goshi based on where their far leg is.

- Your notes
  - (Write when you feel Harai is “on” vs when Uchi is better.)

---

## 5.6 Uki Waza (25:48–30:23)

- Time
  - 25:48–30:23

- Goal
  - Connect sacrifice lateral-drop mechanics (Uki Waza) to the overhook throwing suite.

- Key ideas
  - Uki Waza is your lateral-drop/sacrifice alternative when hip throws are blocked.
  - The overhook anchors their upper body while you drop under their center.
  - Direction is diagonal and sideways, not straight back.

- Core mechanics
  - Setup
    - Strong overhook and head/lat control; draw them slightly forward and to the overhook side.
  - Drop
    - Step your near-side foot across as if for a hip throw.
    - Instead of loading them fully on the hip, sit to the mat at a diagonal angle.
    - Your back/hip lands close to their feet; your far leg blocks or hooks behind their near leg.
  - Rotation
    - Pull with overhook and head to rotate them over your body.
    - Keep your elbow tight so their arm cannot post.

- Cues to remember
  - “If the hip won’t load, sit and spin.”
  - “Fall where they have no post.”
  - “Keep the overhook glued; arm posts kill Uki Waza.”

- Links
  - Connects back to Volume 3’s Uki Waza study; you now see it in the overhook ecosystem.

- Your notes
  - (Note which directions feel safest to fall for you; record any bad landings to avoid.)

---

## 5.7 Kosoto Gake (30:23–36:25)

- Time
  - 30:23–36:25

- Goal
  - Add a rear/outer trip (Kosoto Gake) from the same overhook clinch as a lower-amplitude, high-control finish.

- Key ideas
  - Used when opponent steps their leg back to avoid hip throws or Uki Waza.
  - Your foot hooks behind their heel/calf; upper body does most of the work.
  - Small, controlled trip – ideal for Jiu Jitsu scoring and safety.

- Core mechanics
  - Position
    - Overhook and head/lat control; chest close.
    - Draw them slightly forward so weight is shared between their feet.
  - Entry
    - Step around their near leg so you are beside/behind it.
    - Hook your reaping foot behind their heel/calf (outside of their leg).
  - Finish
    - Pull upper body backward/diagonal while driving your hips forward.
    - Keep hook engaged; think “drag them over the hook” rather than kicking.
    - Guide them down into side control or chest-to-chest pins.

- Cues to remember
  - “Overhook turns, hook collects.”
  - “Trip, don’t kick.”
  - “If they retreat the leg vs hip throws, punish with Kosoto.”

- Links
  - Rounds out the overhook suite: big hip throws, sacrifice throw, and low trip.

- Your notes
  - (Note which stance patterns from Sam make this feel easiest.)

---

## 5.8 Throwing from the Over/Under Tie-Up – Uki Goshi (Half Hip Throw) (36:25–42:33)

- Time
  - 36:25–42:33

- Goal
  - Transfer the half-hip throwing skill into a symmetrical over/under clinch, managing the “who’s winning” side.

- Key ideas
  - Over/under is a common no-gi tie; you must determine which side is dominant.
  - Your underhook side and head position usually dictate who can throw.
  - The throw still depends on getting your hip across and under their center.

- Core mechanics
  - Position
    - One underhook, one overhook; forehead under their jaw on the underhook side.
    - Shoulder pressure into their chest; hips close.
  - Kuzushi
    - Use underhook to lift and turn them.
    - Use overhook to clamp and prevent them from turning away.
  - Entry
    - Step in on underhook side, turning your hips across their stance.
    - Slide into half-hip contact (Uki Goshi style) – not fully across.
  - Finish
    - Rotate them over your hip, pulling with underhook and steering with head.
    - Keep overhook tight to prevent posting or turning.

- Cues to remember
  - “Win the underhook side, win the throw.”
  - “Head and underhook together are your steering wheel.”
  - “Same half-hip feel, new tie.”

- Links
  - Bridges the earlier overhook suite with the upcoming over/under knee-drop and trip options.

- Your notes
  - (Note which side you prefer to throw from in over/under.)

---

## 5.9 Single Knee Drop Variation (42:33–46:42)

- Time
  - 42:33–46:42

- Goal
  - Learn a compact, lower-impact Uki Goshi variation from over/under using a single-knee drop.

- Key ideas
  - Dropping one knee lowers your center and gives a powerful, close-range throw.
  - Useful for shorter or less explosive athletes or when opponent is very upright.
  - Still a hip-based throw; the knee drop just compresses the movement.

- Core mechanics
  - Setup
    - Standard over/under with dominant underhook/head side.
  - Drop
    - Step in as for Uki Goshi, then drop the knee on your underhook side to the mat.
    - Keep your other foot planted as a pivot and drive base.
  - Throw
    - Rotate and pull them over your hip and dropped knee.
    - Head and underhook lift while overhook clamps and guides.

- Cues to remember
  - “Knee down, hips still in.”
  - “Shorter lever, same rotation.”
  - “Drop to throw, not to stall.”

- Links
  - Good choice when your back/hips feel less happy with full standing rotation.
  - Precursor to double-knee drop variation.

- Your notes
  - (Note how the knee drop affects your ability to follow them to top.)

---

## 5.10 Double Knee Drop Variation (46:42–50:28)

- Time
  - 46:42–50:28

- Goal
  - Add a double-knee-drop version of the over/under hip throw for very tight, compact entries.

- Key ideas
  - Both knees go to the mat for an even lower center of gravity.
  - More “sacrifice-like” feel; your body acts as a low fulcrum.
  - Especially useful when you want to avoid high-amplitude throws.

- Core mechanics
  - Setup & drop
    - Over/under position as before.
    - Step in, then drop both knees together in line with their center.
    - Keep hips pressed into them so your knees don’t “run away” from their feet.
  - Throw
    - Use underhook/head to pull them forward and down over your hip/thigh line.
    - Overhook clamps shoulder and prevents them from stepping out.
  - Follow-up
    - As they fall, pop up off your knees into a top control.
    - Prioritize chest connection before worrying about grips.

- Cues to remember
  - “Both knees down, chest still in.”
  - “Low fulcrum, high rotation.”
  - “Use it when you want control, not amplitude.”

- Links
  - Sits between traditional hip throws and full sacrifice throws in risk level.

- Your notes
  - (Note whether you prefer single vs double knee drop for your body type.)

---

## 5.11 Uki Waza from Over/Under (50:28–56:45)

- Time
  - 50:28–56:45

- Goal
  - Apply Uki Waza lateral-drop mechanics directly from an over/under tie.

- Key ideas
  - Same lateral-drop idea as overhook Uki Waza, but now anchored in symmetric clinch.
  - Great counter when opponent drives into you aggressively in over/under.
  - Fall to the side where you can best block their leg and deny posts.

- Core mechanics
  - Position
    - Over/under, head low on underhook side, hips close.
  - Off-balance
    - Draw them forward and slightly to the side of your planned fall.
  - Drop
    - Sit or fall sideways, blocking their leg with your near leg/hip.
    - Keep your underhook lifting and your overhook clamping.
  - Rotation
    - Turn them over your body along the diagonal of their compromised base.
    - Land on your side or hip, with chest oriented to follow up on top.

- Cues to remember
  - “When they drive too hard, disappear sideways.”
  - “Block the leg, rotate the chest.”
  - “Underhook lifts, overhook traps.”

- Links
  - Completes the over/under hip + sacrifice set: hip throws, knee drops, and lateral drop.

- Your notes
  - (Write down which direction of fall feels safest/easiest.)

---

## 5.12 Ouchi Gari (Inside Trip) from Over/Under (56:45–1:02:04)

- Time
  - 56:45–1:02:04

- Goal
  - Add an inside trip from over/under to punish narrow stances and weight shifts.

- Key ideas
  - Inside trip targets the leg between your bodies.
  - Upper body off-balance is critical; the leg is just the final trap.
  - Small, controlled motion – high percentage for Jiu Jitsu rules.

- Core mechanics
  - Setup
    - Over/under stance with your head on underhook side.
    - Pull them slightly forward and across their near leg.
  - Entry
    - Step in close on underhook side.
    - Reap inside of their near leg with your same-side leg.
    - Heel catches just above their heel; knee slightly bent.
  - Finish
    - Pull them over the reaping leg while driving with your hips.
    - Keep chest connection to steer them into the mat.
    - Land in a top orientation where you can immediately pass or stabilize.

- Cues to remember
  - “Hands first, leg last.”
  - “Reap the inside line they’re standing on.”
  - “Trip where their weight already is.”

- Links
  - Connects to previous Ouchi work from cow catcher; same mechanics, new tie.

- Your notes
  - (Note whether you prefer reaping straight back or slightly diagonal.)

---

## 5.13 Step-Around Kosoto Gake (1:02:04–1:10:21)

- Time
  - 1:02:04–1:10:21

- Goal
  - Use a step-around outer reap from over/under to attack the far leg from behind.

- Key ideas
  - Step all the way around their leg so your back is almost to their side/back.
  - The reap is more “behind the heel” than side-on.
  - Excellent follow-up when they defend inside trips or hip throws by stepping back.

- Core mechanics
  - Entry
    - From over/under, pivot and step your outside leg around their near leg.
    - You end almost side/back of them, with your reaping leg behind theirs.
  - Hook & reap
    - Hook your calf/heel behind their leg at or just above the heel.
    - Pull them backward/diagonal over the trapped leg.
  - Upper body
    - Underhook lifts and rotates; overhook clamps shoulder.
    - Keep head close so they cannot easily turn away or spin behind.

- Cues to remember
  - “Step around the leg before you reap.”
  - “Collect heel, then rotate chest.”
  - “If they step back to escape, follow around and trip.”

- Links
  - Bridges Ouchi (inside) and classic Kosoto (outside/behind) options from the same tie.

- Your notes
  - (Record how far around you need to step to feel strong; note what breaks for you.)

---

## 5.14 Kosoto Gake – Calf-to-Calf Variation (1:10:21+)

- Time
  - 1:10:21–end of volume

- Goal
  - Refine Kosoto Gake with a calf-to-calf configuration for maximum control.

- Key ideas
  - Both calves come into contact to “lock” the leg.
  - Less about kicking, more about rotating them over a fixed block.
  - Very stable; good for Jiu Jitsu where you care about clean top landings.

- Core mechanics
  - Leg position
    - Step around as in step-around Kosoto.
    - Slide your calf tightly against the back of their calf.
    - Sometimes both calves “pinch” their leg between them.
  - Finish
    - Rotate your upper body while keeping that calf contact constant.
    - Let them “roll over” your leg rather than knocking it out from under them.
    - Maintain chest contact so you land in control.

- Cues to remember
  - “Calf-to-calf, then turn.”
  - “Pin, then rotate – don’t kick.”
  - “Lock the leg, move the torso.”

- Links
  - Highest-control version of the Kosoto trip from over/under.
  - Good option when you want very low risk of scramble.

- Your notes
  - (Note how much pressure you need before they topple; adjust for weight/height differences between you and Sam.)
