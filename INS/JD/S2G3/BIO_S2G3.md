**Instructor:** John Danaher

## 0. Executive Summary

This instructional builds a complete upper-body–based takedown system for no-gi Jiu Jitsu. The central idea is to start from upper body grips that already resemble scoring positions (chest-to-chest or chest-to-back), instead of relying only on leg tackles that leave you in long, vulnerable transitions before you can stabilize and hold for points.

The opening volume explains why takedowns feel so difficult under Jiu Jitsu rules: you often must hold the opponent for roughly three seconds to score, yet most leg attacks leave you stretched out, off balance, and exposed to sprawls, front headlocks, and counters. By contrast, strong upper body ties can shorten this transition and reduce exposure while still leading directly to pins, back-takes, or front headlock-based finishes.

Across eight volumes, the instructional then organizes a set of tightly connected modules:
- A cow catcher system from the front headlock as a primary scoring engine  
- Uki Waza as a central lateral-drop / sacrifice-throw option  
- Sumi Gaeshi and Ude Gaeshi as core counters to single legs, double legs, and high-crotch attacks  
- Overhook and over/under throwing suites  
- Double overhooks and double underhooks throwing suites  
- Underhook and pinch-headlock series built around common clinch positions in Jiu Jitsu  

The program also addresses who this style is for and what physical qualities it demands. Danaher outlines minimum athletic requirements, preferred body types, and how to adapt the system to different athletes. He then uses pummelling, hip jousting, and other positional drills to build the balance, stance, and grip fighting skills required to make these throws reliable in live training and competition.

Finally, the latter volumes place special emphasis on older and less athletic athletes. The focus shifts toward throws that keep both feet on the floor more often, reduce the need for deep rotational turns and dramatic arching, and still produce consistent scoring outcomes. The result is not a replacement for leg tackles, but a complementary second axis of attack: a way to convert defended shots into throws, to punish opponents who over-defend their legs, and to reach strong top control positions more consistently from standing. 


## 1. Instructional Volume Content

**Volume 1 – Introduction, Concepts & Training Methods**  
This volume lays the conceptual foundation for upper body takedowns, explaining the central problem of takedowns under Jiu Jitsu rules, the advantages and disadvantages of upper body attacks versus leg tackles, the minimum athletic requirements, the main entry routes into upper body grips via the legs, basic shot defense, core grip-fighting principles, and the two key training methods of pummelling and hip jousting that develop these skills.

**Volume 2 – Special Study: Cow Catcher**  
This volume builds a complete cow catcher system from the front headlock, detailing its core mechanics, chin strap–first versus waist-first entries, go-behind setups, elbow-based reaction branches, roll-through options, and complementary throws such as Yoko Sumi Gaeshi and Ouchi Gari to score when opponents stand up or when you counter their shots.

**Volume 3 – Special Study: Uki Waza**  
This volume develops Uki Waza as a central sacrifice and lateral-drop throw, showing how to enter from arm drags, two-on-one ties, opponent headlocks, front headlocks, and overhooks, while emphasizing grip structure, hip placement, and direction of fall so that the sacrifice reliably converts into strong top control positions.

**Volume 4 – Special Study: Sumi Gaeshi & Ude Gaeshi**  
This volume studies Sumi Gaeshi and Ude Gaeshi as core counters to single legs, double legs, and high-crotch attacks, mapping out whizzer/lat/wrist and chest-wrap options, mat-based yoko sumi and two-on-one variations, arm-drag entries, and a detailed treatment of mechanics, setups, applications, and common mistakes to avoid.

**Volume 5 – Overhook & Over/Under Throw Series**  
This volume introduces a throwing suite from overhook and over/under tie-ups, using Uki Goshi, Tai Otoshi (including one-handed and drop-style variations), Uchi Mata, Harai Goshi, Kosoto Gake, Ouchi Gari, and related inside and outside trips to turn dominant clinches into dynamic but controllable takedowns.

**Volume 6 – Double Overhooks & Double Underhooks**  
This volume extends the system into double overhooks and double underhooks, emphasizing Ouchi Gari, step-around and calf-to-calf Kosoto Gake, Uki Waza–style lateral drops, Ken Ken Uchi Mata, and high-lock Uki Goshi and Tai Otoshi, along with sasae-style foot sweeps, all framed around how to off-balance and finish effectively from tight body-lock positions.

**Volume 7 – Underhook & Pinch Headlock Series**  
This volume focuses on underhook- and pinch-headlock-based attacks, teaching Uki Goshi and Ogoshi, Tai Otoshi, Uchi Mata, Kouchi trips, Kosoto/Kouchi combinations from the pinch headlock, reverse lat-grip Osoto Gari, Harai Goshi, and the Georges St-Pierre hybrid throw as a bridge between wrestling-style penetration and Judo-style turning throws.

**Volume 8 – Upper Body Takedowns for Older/Less Athletic Athletes**  
This volume adapts the overall system for older and less athletic athletes, prioritizing Tai Otoshi, Uki Goshi, Kouchi trips, and lateral-drop style Uki Waza entries from arm drags and lat grips, with an emphasis on conservative footwork, reduced reliance on explosive rotation or one-legged balance, and safer but still high-percentage scoring mechanics from upper body ties.

## 2. System Overview

- 2.1 Overall Role of Upper Body Takedowns in Jiu Jitsu
  - Upper body takedowns are presented as a complementary axis of attack alongside leg tackles, not a replacement for them.
  - The system aims to let athletes switch between lower-body and upper-body attacks so that opponents who defend one well can be attacked with the other.
  - Because upper body entries begin closer to chest-to-chest or chest-to-back contact, they are designed to land you directly in, or very near, scoring positions after the throw.

- 2.2 The Central Problem of Takedowns in Jiu Jitsu
  - Most successful takedowns in Jiu Jitsu historically come from leg tackles (single legs, double legs, high crotch), which focus control on the opponent’s legs rather than their torso.
  - Jiu Jitsu scoring demands you stabilize chest-to-chest or chest-to-back for a short but critical time window; going from leg control to upper-body control is often where attempts fail.
  - In standard leg tackles, you must:
    - Penetrate and control the legs.
    - Put the opponent to the mat from a low, extended posture.
    - Then climb from leg control up to the hips, torso, and back within a very small time window, under resistance.
  - The majority of failed takedowns fail in this transition phase: the attacker is stretched out, exposed, and often loses the scramble rather than securing the top.

- 2.3 Structural Advantages of Upper Body Takedowns
  - Start in scoring-oriented contact:
    - Upper body throws are built from chest-to-chest or chest-to-back, or from ties that can quickly be converted into those positions.
    - When the opponent hits the mat, you are already close to optimal pinning positions instead of needing to climb from the legs.
  - Reduced neck and arm exposure:
    - Unlike leg tackles, you are not level-changing deeply underneath the opponent, which reduces exposure to guillotines, D’arce/anaconda strangles, and upper-limb submissions such as kimuras or armlocks during entries.
  - Reduced sprawl risk and bodyweight burden:
    - Upper body entries keep your hips and posture more upright, so failed attempts are less likely to result in you being flattened underneath the opponent’s sprawl and carrying their bodyweight.
  - Direct scoring potential:
    - Because the throws are initiated from scoring-range ties, the same motion that brings them down often gives you immediate chest-to-chest or chest-to-back contact and thus a high likelihood of satisfying the Jiu Jitsu scoring criteria.

- 2.4 Structural Disadvantages of Upper Body Takedowns
  - All-or-nothing nature:
    - Close-contact throws tend to produce either excellent results (clean throw to a pin) or very bad ones (you are counter-thrown), because both athletes are in position to throw each other.
  - Point-blank initiative battle:
    - At tight contact, both athletes have significant throwing potential; success often hinges on who initiates first and who manages off-balancing and direction better in very short time frames.
  - Roll-through and momentum management:
    - Many upper body throws require substantial momentum.
    - If this momentum is not controlled, both athletes may roll through, scrambling past the original pinning intention, which can compromise control or even reverse positions.
  - Requirement for better timing and balance:
    - Because you are not “shooting under” the opponent as in a leg tackle, you must manage your own posture, hip alignment, and breaking of their balance precisely to avoid being countered.

- 2.5 Minimum Athletic Requirements and Athlete Profiling
  - The system is designed around throws that can be learned and applied by a wide range of athletes, with minimal reliance on extreme athleticism.
  - Key required qualities:
    - Ability to maintain solid stance and base under contact.
    - Sufficient mobility to turn the hips and rotate around the opponent.
    - Enough core and leg strength to drive through entries and finishes without relying solely on speed.
  - The instructional explicitly recognizes:
    - Many classic Judo throws demand high levels of flexibility, rotation, and explosive power that are not realistic for all athletes.
    - Certain upper body throws (selected here) can be applied with lower physical demands and still create strong scoring outcomes.
  - Later volumes further tune the selection for older and less athletic athletes, prioritizing stability, shorter movements, two-footed bases, and safer fall dynamics.

- 2.6 Entry Pathways into Upper Body Grips
  - Legs as the gateway to the upper body:
    - Even in an “upper body” system, leg-based actions (fakes, level changes, shot threats) are used to force reactions that open upper body grips.
  - Three main entry methods (as organized in Volume 1):
    - Direct upper body tie-ups from neutral stance.
    - Upper body grips obtained off failed or defended leg attacks (your own or theirs).
    - Upper body grips obtained via snap-downs, arm drags, and other hand-fighting exchanges from standing.
  - The system emphasizes learning to:
    - Use leg attacks and threats to provoke defensive postures that expose the neck, shoulders, and underhook lines.
    - Transition immediately from leg contact or front headlock situations to upper body grips that can launch throws.

- 2.7 Grip Systems and Positional Hierarchy
  - Primary structural ties used across the series:
    - Front headlock and chin strap configurations.
    - Underhooks (single, double).
    - Overhooks, over/under tie-ups.
    - Pinch headlocks and reverse lat grips.
    - Two-on-one (2-on-1) arm controls.
  - Hierarchy logic:
    - Ties are ranked by their ability to:
      - Limit the opponent’s movement.
      - Threaten immediate off-balancing.
      - Link directly to throws that land in scoring positions.
    - The cow catcher, for example, is treated as one of the most controlling transitions from standing to a pin because of its combined head and far-side upper body control.
  - Integration across volumes:
    - Each volume takes one or more of these ties and builds a mini-system:
      - Cow catcher from front headlock.
      - Uki Waza from arm drag, two-on-one, headlock, front headlock, and overhook.
      - Sumi Gaeshi/Ude Gaeshi from whizzer, lat/wrist, chest wrap, and grip variations against shots.
      - Overhook/over-under/double overhook/double underhook/underhook/pinch-headlock suites that recycle the same grip categories in different configurations.

- 2.8 Integration with Ground Outcomes and Follow-Ups
  - Target outcomes:
    - Clean takedown directly into:
      - Chest-to-chest pins.
      - Chest-to-back control leading to back takes.
      - Dominant front headlock positions.
  - Scoring priority:
    - Throws and trips are chosen not only for amplitude or aesthetics but for their likelihood of:
      - Landing you on top.
      - Keeping your head and shoulders over the opponent.
      - Allowing quick stabilization within the scoring window.
  - System feedback into ground game:
    - Many throws lead naturally into the existing Danaher ground systems:
      - Front headlock attacks.
      - Pinning sequences and transitions to the back.
      - Guard passing chains initiated from chest-to-chest landings.
  - Training structure:
    - The program continually ties standing work back to actual match-winning conditions:
      - How to score, not just how to put someone on the floor.
      - How to avoid common post-throw scrambles that erode the positional advantage.

## 3. Core Concepts

- 3.1 Central Problem of Takedowns in Jiu Jitsu
  - Most high-percentage takedowns in Jiu Jitsu are leg tackles that start with lower-body control and only later transition to upper-body control.
  - Scoring requires upper-body domination (chest-to-chest or chest-to-back) maintained for a set period; bridging the gap from legs to torso under resistance is the main failure point.
  - When leg tackles fail or stall in transition, the attacker is often:
    - Extended and off-balance.
    - Exposed to sprawls, front headlocks, and upper-limb submissions.
    - At risk of being counter-scored in the scramble.
  - Core conceptual shift:
    - Start with chest-to-chest or chest-to-back contact before the takedown where possible.
    - Use throws that land directly into those positions so the “transition to scoring” is built into the takedown itself.

- 3.2 Advantages vs Disadvantages of Upper Body Takedowns
  - Advantages:
    - You begin closer to the required scoring positions and do not need to shift from legs up to torso after the opponent hits the mat.
    - Reduced exposure of your neck and arms to guillotines, D’arce/anaconda, and kimura-style attacks compared with deep level-changing leg tackles.
    - Lower likelihood of getting flattened under a sprawl: if an upper body attempt fails, you are typically still on your feet or in a more neutral clinch.
    - The ability to attack opponents who are highly proficient at defending leg tackles, giving you tactical diversity.
  - Disadvantages:
    - All-or-nothing dynamic at close range: both athletes are in strong throwing positions; a mis-timed entry can result in you being thrown instead.
    - Momentum management issues: high-amplitude upper body throws can roll through if not controlled, leading to unpredictable ground scrambles.
    - Sensitivity to timing and direction: you must be precise in your off-balancing; if the opponent steps around or re-directs your entry (for example, stepping around your hips on a hip throw), they can immediately counter with their own throw.
  - Strategic conclusion:
    - Neither leg tackles nor upper body throws are “the answer” alone; effectiveness comes from knowing both and switching between them based on the opponent’s defensive tendencies and the positional context.

- 3.3 Minimum Athletic Requirements for This System
  - The instructional explicitly avoids building a curriculum that depends on extreme explosiveness, flexibility, or youth.
  - The baseline athlete is assumed to:
    - Have enough balance to maintain a solid stance during pummelling, clinching, and throw entries.
    - Possess basic leg and core strength to drive through trips, reaps, and hip rotations without large leaps or jumps.
    - Be able to learn rotational patterns and body alignment rather than relying on raw speed.
  - Certain throws are selected precisely because:
    - They use short, efficient paths of movement rather than big jumps, twisty turns, or long one-legged balances.
    - They scale well to older or less athletic athletes provided they develop good grips, posture, and timing.
  - Later, the “older/less athletic” volume refines this selection even further, emphasizing:
    - Sacrifice throws and two-footed entries that keep your base underneath you.
    - Conservative footwork and controlled falls that are more forgiving on the body over long training careers.

- 3.4 Entering into Upper Body Grips – Legs as Gateway
  - Concept: the legs remain an essential tool even in an “upper body” system, primarily as a means to force reactions that open the torso and head.
  - Three main entry paths:
    - Direct clinch from neutral: hand-fighting, collar ties, and arm ties that gradually progress into overhooks, underhooks, and front headlocks.
    - Leg-threat entries: using real or feinted shots to:
      - Force the opponent’s hands down to defend the legs.
      - Raise their hips and posture in ways that expose the neck and shoulders to front headlocks and underhooks.
    - Snap-downs, arm drags, and two-on-one controls:
      - Dragging or snapping an opponent forward to expose the head and near-side shoulder.
      - Using dominant arm control to feed directly into sacrifice throws (e.g., Uki Waza) or sumi/ude gaeshi-style counters.
  - The core idea is to treat leg work as a gateway, not the final destination:
    - Use it to create upper body grips where the true scoring potential lies.

- 3.5 Defending the Shot and Front Headlock Use
  - Shot defense is not treated as a standalone wrestling module but as a bridge to upper body offense.
  - Key defensive ideas:
    - When the opponent shoots, use sprawls and hip positioning defensively while immediately looking to:
      - Capture the head in front headlock or chin strap.
      - Secure an underhook or tight waist to begin forming a cow catcher or sumi/ude gaeshi counter structure.
    - Do not remain in extended sprawl-only positions; turn the defense into a path to upper body control.
  - From effective shot defense, the system favors:
    - Transitioning into cow catcher-style pinning.
    - Countering with sacrifice throws such as sumi gaeshi and related variations.
    - Using the front headlock as both a submission hub and a takedown hub.

- 3.6 Upper Body Grip Fighting Principles
  - Upper body grip fighting is used to:
    - Establish and maintain frames and levers on the opponent’s head, shoulders, and arms.
    - Build toward dominant ties (overhooks, underhooks, two-on-ones, pinch headlocks).
  - Key themes:
    - Constant hand-fighting to remove the opponent’s grips and replace them with your own.
    - Using head position (“head-to-head”) as a defensive tool against guillotines and as an offensive tool to drive the opponent’s posture.
    - Understanding that control of the shoulders and head determines both:
      - Who can enter for throws.
      - Who can resist or counter the other’s entries.
  - Grip fighting is framed not as an aesthetic prelude but as the functional engine that makes the throws consistently available and safe.

- 3.7 Training Method 1 – Pummelling
  - Pummelling is presented as one of the two major training methods to build upper body skills.
  - Purpose:
    - Develop comfort and endurance in continuous clinch exchanges without high impact.
    - Build sensitivity to:
      - Openings for underhooks, overhooks, and double-unders.
      - Moments when the opponent’s balance is compromised and a trip, throw, or forced hand-to-mat is available.
  - Key training effects:
    - Teaches you to recognize when your back is being tracked, when an opponent is stepping around you, and how to correct before being thrown.
    - Allows you to add scoring elements (e.g., forcing a hand to the mat via hip rotation or trips) into a continuous drill.
    - Helps you practice grip-breaking and recovery from disadvantaged tie-ups (e.g., when the opponent obtains double underhooks).
  - Advantages:
    - Low impact, high cardio value, and directly transferable gripping and balance skills for the standing phase.

- 3.8 Training Method 2 – Hip Jousting
  - Hip jousting targets the hip-level battle that decides many upper body throws.
  - Core drill structure:
    - Both athletes lock into a configuration such as whizzer vs tight waist, underhook vs tight waist, or similar.
    - One athlete seeks to bring their hips into the space needed to throw; the other’s job is to deny that space by “checking” the hips.
  - Key concepts:
    - For an opponent to throw you with upper body techniques, they typically need to insert their hips into a gap under your center of mass.
    - Your defensive answer is to:
      - Keep your hips back when needed.
      - Step in to fill the space and touch your hip to their hip, denying the penetration path.
    - Hip checking is described as the upper body equivalent of sprawling:
      - Sprawl to stop leg attacks.
      - Hip check to stop upper body attacks.
  - Progressive layering:
    - Start with simple hip checks: deny the entry space.
    - Add resistance, attempts to step around, and stronger grip control, forcing you to constantly re-position your hips.
    - Over time, you learn not only to defend throws but to feel when the opponent’s hip position becomes vulnerable to your own upper body entries.
  - Result:
    - Hip jousting builds the underlying positional awareness and defensive skills that make actual throwing exchanges safer and more successful in live rounds.

### 4.1 Volume 1 – Foundational Concepts, Grips & Training Methods

- 4.1.1 Takedown Problem & Scoring Window
  - Clarifies that most Jiu Jitsu takedowns come from leg tackles (single, double, high crotch) that control the legs first and only later climb to hips, torso, and back.  [oai_citation:0‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
  - Emphasizes that Jiu Jitsu scoring demands holding an opponent on two hips, on the back, or with at least one knee down from behind for a timed count, making the leg-to-torso transition the main failure point.  [oai_citation:1‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- 4.1.2 Advantages & Disadvantages of Upper Body Takedowns
  - Advantages:
    - Start from or near chest-to-chest / chest-to-back, shortening the transition to scoring positions.  [oai_citation:2‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
    - Less exposure to sprawls and neck-focused submissions compared with deep level changes for leg tackles.
  - Disadvantages:
    - Close-contact “all-or-nothing” exchanges where both athletes can throw.
    - Momentum and roll-through management become critical to avoid losing top position.

- 4.1.3 Minimum Athletic Requirements
  - Discusses realistic requirements: stance control, basic rotational mobility, and leg/core strength without assuming elite athleticism.  [oai_citation:3‡Titles.txt](sediment://file_00000000dcfc722f9a74cf32709b1499)  
  - Frames later volumes (especially Volume 8) as a refinement for older/less athletic athletes rather than a separate system.

- 4.1.4 Entry Methods – Legs as Gateway to Upper Body
  - Defines three main methods for entering upper body grips from standing, with the legs as the initiating tool, not the final objective.  [oai_citation:4‡Titles.txt](sediment://file_00000000dcfc722f9a74cf32709b1499)  

- 4.1.5 Shot Defense into Upper Body Control
  - Uses sprawl and hip positioning to defend shots but immediately redirects into:
    - Front headlock / chin strap.
    - Underhook or tight waist.
    - Early paths toward cow catcher and sumi/ude gaeshi counters.  [oai_citation:5‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- 4.1.6 Upper Body Grip Fighting
  - Systematizes collar-tie style controls, underhooks, overhooks, and two-on-ones to build toward dominant throwing ties.  [oai_citation:6‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
  - Stresses head position and constant hand-fighting as prerequisites for all later throwing modules.

- 4.1.7 Training Method 1 – Pummelling
  - Presents pummelling as the first “great training method” to build upper body skill.  [oai_citation:7‡Titles.txt](sediment://file_00000000dcfc722f9a74cf32709b1499)  
  - Adds scoring-oriented layers (e.g., forced hand-to-mat, back-taking angles) to turn a basic drill into a live-feeling standing lab.

- 4.1.8 Training Method 2 – Hip Jousting
  - Introduces hip jousting as the second “great training method” to understand hip positioning, hip checking, and throwing windows.   
  - Treats hip checks as the upper-body analog of the sprawl, denying the space required for throws.


### 4.2 Volume 2 – Cow Catcher System

- 4.2.1 Base Cow Catcher Structure
  - Defines cow catcher as a combination of head control through the chin (chin strap or similar) and an underhook that lifts the opponent’s far-side shoulder.  [oai_citation:8‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
  - Describes it as one of the most controlling transitions from standing to pin because it dominates head and shoulders throughout the fall and stabilization.  [oai_citation:9‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- 4.2.2 Two Main Entry Routes
  - Chin strap first → then underhook, starting from front headlock-type ties.   
  - Tight waist first → then chin strap, entering from rear or side body ties before feeding to the head.  [oai_citation:10‡Titles.txt](sediment://file_00000000dcfc722f9a74cf32709b1499)  

- 4.2.3 Go-Behind and Elbow-Based Reactions
  - Uses go-behind attempts to force opponents into defensive turns that expose the head/shoulder line for cow catcher entries.  [oai_citation:11‡Titles.txt](sediment://file_00000000dcfc722f9a74cf32709b1499)  
  - Builds a reaction tree based on the position of the opponent’s elbow (e.g., elbow flares vs stays tight), with each reaction feeding into specific angles and finishes.

- 4.2.4 Roll-Through Series
  - Presents a roll-through as the “perfect compliment” to the cow catcher, allowing continuation when the initial attempt does not settle directly into pin and both athletes roll.  [oai_citation:12‡Titles.txt](sediment://file_00000000dcfc722f9a74cf32709b1499)

  ## 6. Drilling Progressions

- 6.1 Solo Drills

  - 6.1.1 Stance, Level and Hip-Alignment Rehearsal  
    - The instructional repeatedly stresses that throwing success depends on balance, stance, and hip alignment rather than on tricks, and that athletes must be able to control their own posture under contact.   
    - Solo work therefore focuses on:
      - Practising solid, slightly staggered stance with knees bent and hips ready to move forward or back.
      - Rehearsing level changes without collapsing posture, mirroring the same mechanics required when defending shots and entering body locks.
      - Shadowing the “side-on” body turns Danaher uses before Tai Otoshi, Uki Goshi and Kosoto variations, so that turning from square-to-angled becomes automatic once a partner is added.   

  - 6.1.2 Foot-to-Foot Angle Step Repetitions  
    - When teaching calf-to-calf Kosoto and similar throws, Danaher has you step so that one foot comes to the other (“my right foot comes to my left foot, that’s all the angle I need”) before hooking or reaping.   
    - The implied solo component is:
      - Repeating the small “foot-to-foot then hook” angle step without a partner, emphasising minimal movement and precise alignment rather than big spins.
      - Drilling the sensation of turning just enough to align hips and shoulders, so later you can add the actual reap or hook without over-rotating.

  - 6.1.3 Sacrifice-Throw Body-Awareness  
    - For Uki Waza and related sacrifice throws, he notes that:
      - There is no requirement to rotate the shoulders in front of the opponent and minimal balance demand; you “literally just sacrifice your body weight underneath theirs.”   
      - The key control is looking in the direction you want the opponent to land.  [oai_citation:0‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
    - Solo rehearsal therefore emphasises:
      - Practising the sit/fall pattern to the mat with controlled hip and back contact, aligning shoulders and gaze in the direction of the imaginary opponent’s fall.
      - Standing back up immediately and repeating, so the body learns the line of travel before adding a partner and impact.


- 6.2 Partner Drills

  - 6.2.1 Pummelling with Scoring Layer  
    - Pummelling is presented as the first “great training method” for upper body skills and is explicitly framed as a low-impact way to develop grips, balance, and positional awareness.   
    - Core drill:
      - Continuous over-under pummelling, emphasising head position and grip replacement.
      - As skill develops, you add:
        - Forcing a hand to the mat by stepping your hips in and rotating, treating each forced post as a “point.”   
        - Using small trips and hip turns inside the pummelling flow to test off-balancing and expose vulnerabilities (back being tracked, opponent stepping around, etc.).  

  - 6.2.2 Hip Jousting / Hip Checking  
    - Hip jousting is the second “great training method,” described as the upper body equivalent of sprawling.   
    - Drill structure:
      - One athlete has a whizzer; the other has a tight waist / underhook combination.
      - The “attacker” tries to step their hips into the empty space under you to throw.
      - Your job is to “check the hip” by stepping in and touching your hip to theirs, denying that space.
    - Progression:
      - Start with simple hip checks on predictable entries.
      - Add resistance and more dynamic entries so you must repeatedly fill space and turn your hip into theirs, learning to feel when you are about to be thrown and how to shut it down.

  - 6.2.3 Cow Catcher Multiple-Roll Drill  
    - From the cow catcher roll-through position, Danaher explicitly sets up drills that cycle through multiple rolls and re-pins:  
      - You roll the opponent; they roll through and come back to knees; you roll again “once, twice, three times – as many times as it takes to pin him.”   
    - Variants within the same drill:
      - Opponent takes knees off the mat; you explode into the movement as soon as the knee touches, finishing in a pin.   
      - You change the roll direction based on head position (rolling towards the direction the opponent’s head points) to avoid pinning yourself and to finish in top control.   

  - 6.2.4 Shot-Stop to Cow Catcher Start-of-Class Drill  
    - He describes a specific “little drill we often do at the start of class” to train shot defense into cow catcher entries:   
      - Partner starts on knees and shoots (single or double).
      - You practise:
        - Meeting the shot with your hips.
        - Driving the head down.
        - Getting both arms inside (double inside position).
      - Once inside position is achieved, you work into cow catchers on either side as the opponent stands, turns, or tries to drive up, including follow-ups around the corner into pins and Yoko Sumi Gaeshi.   

  - 6.2.5 Slow-Motion Throwing for Safety (Double Overhooks / Kosoto Gake)  
    - For calf-to-calf Kosoto and related throws, Danaher insists on long phases of slow-motion drilling before full-speed execution, to avoid “calling 911.”   
    - Drill emphasis:
      - Start from the live clinch (e.g., opponent wrestles into double underhooks), initially just defending and learning to square up and post on the hips.
      - Then lock double overhooks, get side-on, and repeatedly drill:
        - Small foot-to-foot angle step.
        - Calf-to-calf hook.
        - Controlled descent, often releasing slightly so the partner can breakfall safely.
      - Only after comfort is built do you start keeping chest-to-chest and holding through the fall.

  - 6.2.6 Older-Athlete Uki Waza and Uke Goshi Progressions  
    - For older/less athletic athletes, he explicitly teaches Uki Waza and related throws in “slow motion” with a partner who sets their hips back and supports your weight so you can feel the mechanics without crashing to the mat.   
    - Key emphasis:
      - Partner maintains strong stance and back-support so you can carefully drop into position.
      - You repeat the grip sequence (e.g., ear to back of head, deep overhook, hip placement) and only then add the fall.
      - This is framed as the way ageing or less athletic students should first learn the move before using it in sparring.


- 6.3 Situational Sparring

  - 6.3.1 Cow Catcher Pin-and-Submission Rounds  
    - Later in the cow catcher module, Danaher has Jade and Placido run semi-live rounds where they:   
      - Hit cow catchers and roll-throughs.
      - Transition from pins into submissions: juji gatame (armbar), guillotine, triangle, and mount.
      - Mix spontaneous decision-making: sometimes step into mount for points, sometimes fall into triangle when the armbar fails.
    - This is effectively coached as situational sparring from the cow catcher family: you start from standing or referee’s position, hit the takedown, then chain attacks based on the opponent’s reactions.

  - 6.3.2 Weight-Reading Clinch Exchanges (Forward vs Backward Throws)  
    - In the underhook and tai otoshi/ukigoshi material, he explicitly instructs live “push-pull” exchanges where the athlete reads whether the opponent’s weight is on the balls of the feet (forward) or heels (backward) and then selects forward or backward throws accordingly.   
    - This is described as a realistic competitive scenario:
      - Circling and pulling to feel whether the opponent leans back (heels) or forward (toes).
      - Changing from forward throws to back-steps, sweeps or trips when the opponent resists and shifts weight backward.
      - Potentially chaining multiple iterations (forwards–backwards–forwards) against better opponents.

  - 6.3.3 Shot-Driven Situational Rounds  
    - The cow catcher and Sumi/Ude Gaeshi modules explicitly ask you to imagine and train “you’re out there sparring” against a shooter:   
      - Opponent repeatedly attacks with single legs, doubles, or high crotch.
      - Your trained responses:
        - Initial sprawl/hip defense.
        - Hands in front, head control, and elbow position.
        - Transition into cow catcher, Sumi Gaeshi, Yoko Sumi Gaeshi or Ude Gaeshi depending on head and arm alignment.
      - The scenarios include both knees-on-the-mat shots and standing high-singles, reflecting actual competition exchanges.

## 7. Application Scenarios

- 7.1 Versus Wrestling-Style Leg Attacks

  - 7.1.1 Single Leg, Double Leg and High Crotch  
    - Sumi Gaeshi and Ude Gaeshi are framed as “special study” counters specifically to single, double and high-crotch entries:
      - Whizzer + wrist Sumi Gaeshi when they capture one leg.   
      - Lat + wrist Sumi Gaeshi when arm alignment changes.
      - Chest-wrap and butterfly-hook Sumi Gaeshi variations against deep double legs.
      - Sumi Gaeshi vs high crotch when the opponent commits heavily to that path.
    - Cow catcher is further used as a control mechanism after shot defense:
      - From sprawls and head-down situations, you move to double inside arms and chin/underhook, then finish in a strangle/pin rather than a scramble.   

  - 7.1.2 High Single and Standing Shots  
    - When the opponent transitions from knee-based shot to high single, Danaher redirects the head to the outside and enters Yoko Sumi Gaeshi, finishing in half-nelson-based pins as they try to stand.   
    - The message for application:
      - Shots are not just defensive events; they are reliable gateways into upper body throws and pins when you consistently bring the head down and work to double inside arms.

- 7.2 Versus Duck Unders and Opponents Getting Behind You

  - 7.2.1 Osoto Gari Counter Series  
    - A particular Osoto variation is shown with three “really good applications”:   
      - Countering a double leg where the opponent climbs up and gets their ear to your back.
      - Countering a strong duck-under that beats your elbow and again places the ear on your back.
      - Countering when the opponent already has a lock behind you on the mat: you stand together and use the lap/hip connection to hook and cast them down.
    - The scenario focus:
      - Any time the opponent’s ear touches your back (standing or from knees), you use this Osoto family to reverse position and finish hip-to-hip on top.

- 7.3 Versus Double Underhooks and Body Locks

  - 7.3.1 From Being Underhooked to Throwing with Double Overhooks  
    - The instructional shows situations where the opponent wrestles their way into double underhooks; initially you defend by squaring up, posting on the hips and keeping hips away.   
    - Once the grip loosens and you re-lock with double overhooks, you:
      - Take angle with a small foot-to-foot step.
      - Enter calf-to-calf Kosoto Gake or Ouchi-style reaps to put the opponent down and pin.   

  - 7.3.2 Exploiting the Body Lock in Slippery Conditions  
    - Double underhooks/body lock are highlighted as especially effective in late-match, sweaty conditions because they do not rely on friction-based gi grips.   
    - From there, Ken Ken Uchi Mata and back-bend takedowns become high-percentage choices to control and put strong wrestlers down even when standard grips slip.

- 7.4 Versus Turtle and Stand-Up Defenses

  - 7.4.1 Rolling and Re-Rolling Against Turtle  
    - Cow catcher entries from front headlock and shot defense are directly tied to opponents turtling or trying to stand:
      - Multiple-roll drill: you roll, they turtle and roll through, you re-roll until you achieve a stable pin.   
      - When their knees leave the mat as they try to stand, you explode through at the moment the knee touches again to finish.   

  - 7.4.2 Dual Threat: Back Exposure vs Front Pins  
    - In one scenario, the opponent is in referee’s position, worried about back exposure; Danaher has the attacker move the forearm over the neck, whip around in front and throw into a front-side pin, then finish with a triangle when the opponent comes up.   
    - Application insight:
      - The same cow-catcher-style control allows you to threaten the back and front simultaneously, forcing the opponent to guess which direction the attack will come from.

- 7.5 Scoring and Submission Chains from Standing to Ground

  - 7.5.1 Pins into Arm Locks and Chokes  
    - From cow catcher landings, Danaher explicitly chains:
      - Juji gatame (quarter → three-quarter → extended armbar).
      - Guillotines, where the left foot comes over the opponent’s hip and the finish is generated by hip extension rather than dropping the knee to the mat.   
    - This is presented as the natural continuation of the takedown:
      - Throw → pin → immediate submission attempts, not separate phases.

  - 7.5.2 Transitioning to Mount and Triangle  
    - In the same spontaneous rounds, one athlete is asked to step into mount from the roll-through, while the other converts failed armbars into triangles, showing how the standing-to-ground phase flows directly into high-scoring and submission-dense positions.   

- 7.6 Strategy for Older / Less Athletic Competitors

  - 7.6.1 Sacrifice Throws as “Lasting” Weapons  
    - Danaher states that sacrifice throws such as Uki Waza, Sumi Gaeshi and Tomoe Nage are the last throws ageing athletes can reliably perform in sparring, even after injuries and hip replacements.   
    - For older/less athletic athletes:
      - The advantage is that “the position you start in is the position you throw in” with minimal turning and no long one-legged balances.
      - Uki Waza in particular requires no rotation of shoulders in front of the opponent and virtually no balance requirement.

  - 7.6.2 Conservative Stabbing-Step and Trip Game  
    - He recommends conservative takedowns that:
      - Keep you on two feet for most of the movement.
      - Use a stabbing step and an ankle pick or Kouchi-style trip to upset base instead of big hip turns.   
    - Example scenario:
      - From an underhook or overhook, you stab step inside, place your foot behind the opponent’s foot as a blocker, and pick the ankle to bring them down without needing high-speed rotation.
    - Practical conclusion:
      - Older or less athletic athletes can still apply the full system by biasing toward sacrifice throws and short, stable footwork options that obey the same conceptual rules but place far less stress on the body.
      
      ## 8. Four-Week Curriculum

### 8.1 Week 1 – Foundations, Concepts & Core Entries

- 8.1.1 Objectives
  - Understand why leg tackles dominate Jiu Jitsu takedowns yet often fail to score because they start with chest-to-thigh and must transition to chest-to-chest/back.   
  - Grasp why upper body takedowns reverse this order by starting with chest-to-chest/back so you land directly in scoring positions.   
  - Learn minimum athletic requirements and basic stance, posture and balance demands for this system.  [oai_citation:0‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- 8.1.2 Technical Themes (Volumes 1–2)
  - Central problem of leg tackles and the scoring window.
  - Advantages and disadvantages of upper body takedowns.
  - Minimum athletic requirements and athlete profiling.
  - Entering into upper body grips via the legs (“legs as gateway”).
  - Shot defense into front headlock and early cow catcher structure.   

- 8.1.3 Core Drills
  - Solo:
    - Stance and level-change rehearsals that maintain posture.
    - Shadow turns used for Tai Otoshi/Uki Goshi/Kosoto patterns (small “foot-to-foot then hook” angle steps).  [oai_citation:1‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
  - Partner:
    - Pummelling as the first “great training method” with added scoring layer (forcing hands to the mat).   
    - Basic hip jousting: whizzer vs tight waist, learning to hip-check and deny throwing space.  [oai_citation:2‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- 8.1.4 Situational Focus
  - Light positional sparring from over/under clinch, with the main goal being stance, posture, and grip recovery rather than throws.
  - Simple shot-defense rounds where the only requirement is to stop the shot and establish front headlock or double-inside position (no throws yet).   


### 8.2 Week 2 – Cow Catcher & Uki Waza Modules

- 8.2.1 Objectives
  - Build a robust scoring system around the cow catcher from front headlock and go-behind attempts.   
  - Introduce Uki Waza as the main sacrifice/lateral-drop throw from arm drag, two-on-one, headlock, front headlock and overhook ties.  [oai_citation:3‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)

  - Second-line defenses: Yoko Sumi Gaeshi and Ouchi Gari when opponents stand or try to turn out.  [oai_citation:5‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
  - Uki Waza as:
    - Arm-drag/hip variation.
    - Two-on-one vs opponent headlocks.

    - Overhook lateral drop with “stabbing step” setup and blocked saving step.   

- 8.2.3 Core Drills
  - Partner:
    - Shot-stop to cow catcher warm-up drill from knees (sprawl → double inside → cow catcher entries both sides).   
    - Cow catcher multiple-roll drill: roll, re-roll, and pin against turtling opponent.  [oai_citation:6‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
    - Progressive Uki Waza entries from:
      - Static arm-drag.
      - Flowing two-on-one.
      - Headlock and front headlock.
      - Overhook over/under ties.
    - Emphasis on “look where you want them to land” and controlling fall direction.  [oai_citation:7‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- 8.2.4 Situational Focus
  - Standing scenarios starting from:
    - Front headlock: athlete must either snap to cow catcher, roll-through, or switch to Uki Waza/Yoko Sumi based on opponent’s stand-up attempts.
    - Over-under tie: athlete hunts overhook Uki Waza or Kosoto/Ouchi when opponent steps to recover balance.   


### 8.3 Week 3 – Sumi/Ude Gaeshi and Overhook/Over-Under Suites

- 8.3.1 Objectives
  - Make leg attacks (single, double, high crotch) into opportunities for Sumi Gaeshi and Ude Gaeshi rather than pure defensive events.   
  - Build a comprehensive overhook and over/under throwing suite around Uki Goshi, Tai Otoshi, Uchi Mata, Harai Goshi and Kosoto/Ouchi.

  - Sumi Gaeshi family:
    - Whizzer + wrist vs single.
    - Lat + wrist vs single.
    - Chest-wrap and butterfly Sumi vs double.
    - Sumi vs high crotch.
    - Yoko Sumi on the mat and two-on-one/yoko and arm-drag variants.  [oai_citation:8‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
  - Ude Gaeshi:
    - Mechanics, applications, setups and common mistakes.  [oai_citation:9‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
  - Overhook/over-under hip and leg-attack throws:
    - Overhook Uki Goshi (half hip).
    - Tai Otoshi and one-handed Tai Otoshi (“on two feet” emphasis).   
    - Overhook Uchi Mata as the single most important upper-body throw, plus Harai Goshi.   
    - Overhook Uki Waza and Kosoto/Ouchi reaps, including step-around and calf-to-calf Kosoto.  [oai_citation:10‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- 8.3.3 Core Drills
  - Sumi/Ude gaeshi counter rounds starting from:
    - Partner on a committed single leg.
    - Partner on deep double.
    - Partner on high crotch.
    - Athlete cycles through whizzer/lat/wrist/chest-wrap entries and chooses Sumi or Ude Gaeshi based on arm/shoulder line.  [oai_citation:11‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
  - Overhook/over-under throwing chains:
    - Start from neutral clinch, obtain overhook or over/under.
    - Drill sequences: overhook Uki Goshi → Uchi Mata → Harai → Kosoto/Ouchi follow-ups as opponent fights balance.   

- 8.3.4 Situational Focus
  - Rounds starting with:
    - Partner mandated to shoot every 10–15 seconds; defender must convert to Sumi/Ude Gaeshi or cow catcher rather than sprawling only.
    - Overhook/over-under “initiative wars”: both athletes try to be first to off-balance and throw, not merely hold and stall.   


### 8.4 Week 4 – Double Over/Under, Underhook/Pinch Headlock & Older-Athlete Integration

- 8.4.1 Objectives
  - Develop robust offense from double overhooks and double underhooks/body lock, especially in slippery/no-gi conditions.   
  - Add underhook and pinch-headlock throw chains.
  - Integrate the “older/less athletic” curriculum of two-footed throws and sacrifice options.   

- 8.4.2 Technical Themes (Volumes 6–8)
  - Double overhooks:
    - Ouchi and Kosoto (step-around and calf-to-calf) from double overhooks.  [oai_citation:12‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
    - Uki Waza-style lateral drop from overhooks/body lock.

    - Understanding why body lock is highly reliable when grips slip.
    - Back-bend takedown with minimal athletic requirement.   
    - Ken Ken Uchi Mata and high-lock Uki Goshi/Tai Otoshi plus Sasae-style foot sweep.   
  - Underhook/pinch-headlock suite:
    - Underhook Uki Goshi, Ogoshi, Tai Otoshi, Uchi Mata, Kouchi.  [oai_citation:13‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
    - Pinch-headlock Uki Goshi with Kosoto/Kouchi chains.
    - Reverse lat-grip Osoto and Harai Goshi; GSP hybrid throw.  [oai_citation:14‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
  - Older-athlete package:
    - Two-on-one → Tai Otoshi to hands-and-knees (modest goal, front-headlock follow-up).  [oai_citation:15‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  
    - Uki Goshi hustle: repeated small steps until knee lands between opponent’s knees.   
    - Arm-drag Kouchi, conservative Uki Goshi and Kouchi, and lateral drops tuned for safety.  [oai_citation:16‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- 8.4.3 Core Drills
  - Double-under to double-over transition drill:
    - Start with opponent obtaining double underhooks.
    - Defend by squaring, posting hips, then recover to double overhooks and enter calf-to-calf Kosoto/Ouchi.   
  - Body-lock Ken Ken Uchi Mata rounds:
    - From locked body lock, athlete hops Uchi Mata while partner tries to square and escape, emphasising balance in slippery settings.   
  - Older-athlete mini-circuit:
    - 2-on-1 Tai Otoshi to hands-and-knees → front headlock.
    - Uki Goshi hustle repetitions with cooperative partner.
    - Arm-drag Kouchi and conservative Kouchi/Uki Goshi from over/under ties.   

- 8.4.4 Integration Rounds
  - Start standing, free choice of upper and lower body attacks.
  - Encouraged sequencing:
    - Leg tackle attempts feed Sumi/Ude Gaeshi or cow catcher.
    - Failed overhooks shift to double underhooks/body lock.
    - Older athletes preferentially use Tai Otoshi to hands-and-knees, Uki Waza, Sumi and hustle-style Uki Goshi.

## Annex A: Extracted Key Passages

- A.1 Central Problem of Takedowns in Jiu Jitsu
  - "Everything comes out of a central problem that occurs in the overall context of takedowns in Jiu-Jitsu."
  - "Statistically the most successful and important takedowns in Jiu-Jitsu are leg tackles. The majority of takedowns scored in our sport are tackles to the legs."
  - "So the scores in Jiu-Jitsu tend to come from chest to chest and chest to back positions. But leg tackles invariably are chest to thigh positions. That requires that you make a transition from chest to thigh up to either chest to chest or chest to back."
  - "So the central problem of takedowns is that our control starts chest to thigh, but ultimately what's needed is a transition from the thigh up to the chest."

- A.2 Difficulty of Scoring After Leg Tackles
  - "If I've tackled my opponent down to a situation where he stays on two hips, like so, if he stays here for three seconds, that's a successful takedown."
  - "Now fellas, the chances of you holding someone down on two hips for three seconds, when they don't want that to happen, are minimal."
  - "So it's so easy for your opponent, once you've taken them down to the mat, to either turn to their knees, get the majority of their back off the floor, or if they're on their knees, get their knees off the mat and go to a four point position, that it becomes damn near impossible in the time available to hold someone down and get a score."
  - "You’re stuck down on their legs, and it's very, very hard in that transition from legs to chest to chest, or chest to back, to prevent them from moving in ways that prevent a score."

- A.3 Upper Body Takedowns Reverse the Order
  - "Upper body takedowns reverse the order of operations. The upper body control comes first before the takedown."
  - "This means that upon completion of the takedown you already have the close upper body contact and control required to score under Jiu Jitsu rules. There is no need to shift from one part of the body to another."
  - "Because you begin with chest to chest or chest to back positioning, the ensuing scramble after the takedown is so much more difficult for your opponent."

- A.4 Tactical Complementarity: Upper and Lower Body
  - "It is my earnest belief that upper body takedowns can add a significant amount of effectiveness to your standing game and are a great complement to the more popular and well-known lower body takedowns."
  - "Just as submissions work better when the whole body is the target than when you limit yourself to only the upper body or the lower body, so too takedowns become much easier when you can switch between lower body and upper body."
  - "Interestingly, many opponents who defend the lower body takedowns very well can be attacked much more easily with upper body moves and many who defend the upper body takedowns well can be taken down much more easily with lower body tackles, so knowing both can be a big tactical advantage."

- A.5 Advantages of Upper Body Takedowns
  - "There is no need to actually level change down to the legs."
  - "There is a much higher chance of a subsequent score along with a lower chance of submissions to arms and neck or getting caught underneath your opponent's sprawl."
  - "There's very little danger of being attacked by a guillotine because we typically work head to head. There's no difference in our levels as there are in the case of leg tackles."
  - "You don't have to worry about neck exposure and arm exposure to submission holds. You generally don't have to worry about being caught underneath your training partner's body weight if the takedown should fail."

- A.6 Disadvantages and Risk Profile of Upper Body Takedowns
  - "The first major disadvantage of upper body takedowns is they tend to have an all or nothing quality to them. When they go right, they go great. Perfect result. When they go wrong, they go absolutely to hell."
  - "Because you're both so close in the contact with each other, they tend to result either in a great victory or a great defeat."
  - "Once you start getting this close to people, things happen quickly and they can happen very well and very badly."
  - "Second big problem is the roll through problem. The roll through problem is that when we hit any kind of upper body throw, a certain amount of momentum has to be imparted to make the throw work."

- A.7 Conceptual Design of This Programme
  - "In this video, I focus on upper body throws that have minimal athletic requirements. They can be learned by most people in a relatively short time frame."
  - "I have also added a section for older or less athletic students to point out that certain upper body moves require less dexterity and athleticism but can still be very effective."
  - "My students were able to incorporate this upper body takedown programme into their training and use it to win matches and medals at the biggest grappling show in history."

- A.8 Aging, Athleticism and Throw Selection
  - "Age has an effect on all of us and the two things which are required more than anything else for success in upper body throws, flexibility and the ability to balance on one leg, typically diminish quite quickly with age."
  - "Two hardest things about learning to throw a resisting human being in a competitive situation are having the confidence and ease of motion to turn in front of them and to balance on one foot while you're maintaining both your weight and their weight."
  - "My advice to you is simple. Focus on the throws that feature the least demand to turn 180 degrees in front of your opponent and the throws that keep you on two feet."
  - "It's time for us to start looking at a curriculum for older and less athletic athletes who still want to be able to throw effectively with the upper body."

- A.9 Two-Footed Strategy and Modest Goals
  - "Those two things are a little tough for some of the older athletes and those who don't come from an athletic background. So my recommendation is learn to throw people on two feet so that balance is easier."
  - "So your balance is so much better when you're on two feet than one foot."
  - "I'm going to stay on two feet for my throw. I'm just going to take my right foot and extend it across for Tai Otoshi."
  - "I've got a more modest goal. I just want to off-balance him down to his hands and knees. That puts him in a situation where I can lock up a front headlock."

- A.10 Sacrifice Throws and Uki Waza for Older Athletes
  - "It's my belief that sacrifice throws are the last throws that ageing athletes can effectively perform in sparring."
  - "Sacrifice throws in general are relatively easy for older, less athletic people to use in sparring."
  - "The great advantage of uke waza is that the position you start in is the position you throw in. I don't have to turn any kind of distance. I don't have to balance on one leg."
  - "It is my earnest belief that uke waza, the lateral drop, is an excellent throw for less athletically talented students."
  - "If you actually look at it, uke waza does not require you at all to turn your shoulders in front of your opponent. There's no rotation whatsoever."
  - "Secondly, there's no balance requirement whatsoever. You literally just sacrifice your body weight underneath theirs."

- A.11 Psychological Reality for Older or Less Athletic Students
  - "Whenever I go to teach upper body takedowns, there's always a predictable response. Everyone in the room who's a little bit older or perhaps a little less athletic looks at them with horror on their face and is thinking, I'm never going to be able to do that."
  - "It's fair enough that they think that way."
  - "You find when he locks up tight with you, you try to turn and think, there's no way. You can't get your hips across. You can't successfully turn."
  - "Then you try to hop on one foot. He locks his hands around your waist and you go, oh my god, this is terrible. It's never going to work."

- A.12 Summary Vision for the Standing System
  - "It's important we have a conceptual understanding of what we're trying to achieve with the techniques and tactics seen in this video."
  - "Upper body techniques start with upper body contact. You've already got the upper body chest to chest or chest to back situation. Then from here, we go into the throw."
  - "Because you begin with chest to chest or chest to back positioning, the ensuing scramble after the takedown is so much more difficult for your opponent."
  - "These are important reasons why we ought to be studying upper body takedowns."

## Annex B: Terminology

- Cow Catcher  
  - A standing-to-ground pinning system combining head control (chin strap/front headlock) with far-side upper body control (underhook/tight waist), used to transition directly into pins and submissions.   

- Uki Waza  
  - A sacrifice/lateral-drop throw where you sit or fall under the opponent, using one leg to drive and the other to block while your head and gaze direct the fall.   

- Sumi Gaeshi  
  - A backwards/diagonal sacrifice throw used primarily as a counter to leg attacks (single, double, high crotch), often built around whizzer/lat/wrist or chest-wrap grips and butterfly hooks.  [oai_citation:21‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- Ude Gaeshi  
  - An upper-body throw that uses arm and shoulder control to flip the opponent when alignment favours arm-based leverage more than classic Sumi Gaeshi mechanics.  [oai_citation:22‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- Yoko Sumi Gaeshi  
  - Sideways variation of Sumi Gaeshi, performed from standing or mat-based positions, frequently used when opponents stand up out of cow catcher or shot-defense scenarios.   

- Ken Ken Uchi Mata  
  - Hopping version of Uchi Mata executed from body lock/double underhooks, where the attacker hops in place while reaping between the opponent’s legs.   

- Hip Jousting / Hip Checking  
  - A training method where athletes fight for hip placement—one trying to enter throwing space, the other “checking” the hip to deny that space; described as the upper body analogue of sprawling.  [oai_citation:23‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- Pummelling  
  - Continuous over-under hand-fighting drill used to develop grip changes, sensitivity to underhooks/overhooks and opportunities for back-takes, trips and throws.   

- Hustle Uke Goshi  
  - A variant of Uki Goshi for less athletic athletes where you repeatedly step and “hustle” the opponent down rather than executing a single explosive turn.

## Annex C: Additional Notes

- C.1 Competition Validation  
  - Danaher notes that his students used this upper body takedown programme to win matches and medals at a major grappling event, highlighting practical effectiveness rather than theory only.  [oai_citation:24‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- C.2 Upper vs Lower Body as Complement, Not Replacement  
  - He repeatedly stresses that leg tackles remain extremely effective and that upper body takedowns are meant to complement, not replace, them.   

- C.3 Emphasis on Minimal Athletic Requirements  
  - The chosen throws are those he believes “can be learned by most people in a relatively short time frame” and that avoid extreme flexibility or one-legged balance where possible.   

- C.4 Scoring-First Design  
  - Techniques are selected not only for amplitude but for landing directly into chest-to-chest/back or front-headlock-based control, acknowledging Jiu Jitsu’s three-second scoring rule and the ease with which trained opponents can turtle or turn away.   

- C.5 Ageing Athlete Strategy  
  - For older athletes, he explicitly recommends:
    - Two-footed throws.
    - Grips that avoid fighting directly against shoulder strength.
    - More modest objectives (hands-and-knees) linked to strong front headlock follow-ups.

## Annex D: Master System Diagram (ASCII)

- D.1 Purpose
  - Show how all core subsystems connect from neutral
    stance and hand fight to upper body ties, throws,
    counters to shots, and finally to pins, back-takes
    and submissions, including younger vs older-athlete
    decision paths.

- D.2.1 Notes
  - Leg threats are symmetrical: both athletes can shoot;
    the system turns their shots into Sumi / Ude Gaeshi or
    cow catcher, and your failed shots into front headlock
    or other upper ties instead of neutral resets.
  - Upper ties (front headlock, two-on-one, overhook,
    underhook, pinch headlock, double over/under) are the
    main launchpad for every throw and sacrifice entry.
  - All branches are designed to end in three families of
    control: chest-to-chest pins, chest-to-back / body lock,
    or dominant front headlock with immediate submissions.

- OH/UH  = overhook / underhook
- UG/TO/UM/HARAI = Uki Goshi, Tai Otoshi,
  Uchi Mata, Harai Goshi

- D.3.1 Notes
  - Front headlock → cow catcher family: direct pins if
    they stay low, Yoko Sumi or Ouchi if they stand or
    turn out, plus front-headlock submissions layered on.
  - Overhook / underhook → two engines:
    - Hip-throw engine (Uki Goshi, Tai Otoshi, Uchi Mata,
      Harai Goshi) when you win hip alignment.
    - Trip engine (Kosoto, Ouchi, Kouchi) when legs are
      exposed or they step to save balance.
  - Two-on-one / arm drag / snap → sacrifice and short-trip
    engine: Uki Waza, Sumi, Ude Gaeshi, Kouchi, especially
    useful for older or less athletic athletes.
  - All engines feed back into chest-to-chest or chest-to-
    back control rather than stopping at “just a throw.”

- D.4.1 Notes
  - Any deep leg attack is treated as a trigger for one of
    your prebuilt counters, not just a reason to sprawl and
    wait.
  - Whizzer plus wrist, lat plus wrist, and chest-wrap with
    or without butterfly hook define which Sumi or Ude Gaeshi
    variation you select.
  - High singles that are brought up to standing are pushed
    into Yoko Sumi Gaeshi and half-nelson style controlling
    finishes so you score rather than reset.

----

- D.5.1 Notes
  - From the same body-lock platform you branch differently
    by athlete type:
    - Younger / highly athletic profiles emphasise Ken Ken
      Uchi Mata, big hip throws and sweeps with more impact
      and more roll-through management.
    - Older / less athletic profiles emphasise two-footed Tai
      Otoshi to hands-and-knees into front headlock, plus
      sacrifice throws and hustle-style Uki Goshi that keep
      balance demands low.
  - The design goal is a single shared system where the tie
    choices are identical but the throw selection and intended
    landing outcomes are tuned to the athlete’s physical
    resources and longevity needs.

## Annex E: Common Failure Patterns

- E.1 Failing to Transition from Legs to Upper Body after Tackles  
  - Pattern:
    - Athlete hits a leg tackle, controls the legs but never transitions to chest-to-chest/back before the opponent turtles or turns to knees, losing the score.   
  - Consequence:
    - No takedown points; attacker often ends in a neutral or even inferior scramble.  
  - System Answer:
    - Incorporate upper body attacks so you can start from chest-to-chest/back or quickly climb there; treat leg tackles as one option in a broader system, not the only weapon.  [oai_citation:25‡John Danaher_Standing2G_Upper Body Takedowns_Full Transcripts.txt](sediment://file_000000001ff8722fa9b5c6f7067d6a06)  

- E.2 Over-Rotating or Rolling Through on Upper Body Throws  
  - Pattern:
    - Athlete generates too much momentum on throws like Uki Waza, Sumi Gaeshi or hip throws, causing uncontrolled roll-through and loss of top position.  
  - Consequence:
    - Opponent rides the momentum to scramble up or even reverse.  
  - System Answer:
    - Focus on directing the fall with head and gaze; drill controlled, low-amplitude versions first; use multiple-roll cow catcher drills to learn how to stay on top during rotation.   

- E.3 Trying to Turn While Trapped Inside Opponent’s Shoulders  
  - Pattern:
    - Athlete tries to perform hip throws while opponent clamps arms around shoulders (e.g., strong overhook control against you), making turning extremely difficult.   
  - Consequence:
    - Throws feel impossible; balance is compromised; potential for counter-throws.  
  - System Answer:
    - First get outside their arms using two-on-one → arm drag → lat grip; from there, turning becomes far easier and throws like Tai Otoshi and hustling Uki Goshi become accessible.   

- E.4 Reliance on One-Legged Balance and Hopping Throws for Older Athletes  
  - Pattern:
    - Older/less athletic athletes attempt classic hopping Uchi Mata or big turning throws that demand extended one-legged balance.   
  - Consequence:
    - Loss of balance, falls without control, inability to apply moves in live rounds.  
  - System Answer:
    - Shift toward:
      - Two-footed Tai Otoshi that only off-balances to hands-and-knees.
      - Sacrifice throws (Uki Waza, Sumi) where “the position you start in is the position you throw in.”
      - Hustle-style Uki Goshi with repeated short steps.   

- E.5 Treating Shot Defense as a Dead End Instead of a Gateway  
  - Pattern:
    - Athlete sprawls and simply holds the position, waiting for a stand-up reset or getting stuck in static front-headlock battles.  
  - Consequence:
    - Missed scoring chances; fatigue and stalling; eventual referee interference.  
  - System Answer:
    - Always pair shot defense with:
      - Transition to front headlock and cow catcher.
      - Sumi Gaeshi/Ude Gaeshi/Yoko Sumi counters once you secure whizzer/lat/wrist or chest-wrap.
      - Practised drills where every defended shot must feed a specific counter or control.
