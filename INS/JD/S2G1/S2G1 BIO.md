## 1.0 INSTRUCTIONAL VOLUME CONTENT

- **1.1 Volume 1 – Standing Preliminaries: Stance, Motion & Takedown Priorities**  
  - Frames takedowns in jiu-jitsu as high-risk actions because there are no standing resets and failed shots lead directly into submissions and scrambles.  
  - Introduces the four big ideas of the series: avoid carrying opponent’s weight, progress from easier to harder takedowns, hand fight with direction, and always account for the aftermath of a takedown.  
  - Builds the foundational stance model (defensive responsibility, offensive potential, vision) plus same-side vs opposite-side stances and basic movement.  
  - Covers first contact and initial grips, finishing with the principle of getting your head and hands inside the opponent’s elbows as the gateway to all later attacks.

- **1.2 Volume 2 – Hand Fighting Principles & Dominant Standing Position**  
  - Redefines hand fighting as “head-and-hands fighting,” not random grip slapping, and emphasises that every grip should move you towards a better position.  
  - Defines neutral, bad and dominant standing positions in terms of head placement, elbow line and grip priorities.  
  - Builds a hierarchy of ties (collar ties, underhooks, overhooks, wrist and biceps control) and shows how to use them to steer stance, expose the front leg and protect against level changes.  
  - Stresses that hand fighting must always have directional intent: towards angles that open lanes to legs, to the back, or into front headlocks, instead of static 50/50 grip exchanges.

- **1.3 Volume 3 – Snapdowns & the Front-Leg Takedown Framework**  
  - Establishes snapdowns as the “jab” of the standing game: a repeatable, relatively low-risk action that moves feet, breaks stance and starts your offence.  
  - Details mechanics of effective snapdowns (head position, elbow angle, footwork, timing) and connects them to front headlocks and front-leg exposure.  
  - Introduces the four-phase model for front-leg tackles: setup, catch, connection, completion, and uses it to structure all front-leg takedowns.  
  - Links stance-breaking ideas (hands to mat, outside the elbows, head-and-shoulder lanes) directly into specific takedown entries instead of treating them as abstract concepts.

- **1.4 Volume 4 – Double Leg Takedowns: Variants, Setups & Distance Entries**  
  - Builds a complete double-leg system using the four phases, starting from short-range, high-control setups and only later adding true distance shots.  
  - Covers key double-leg variants: standard penetration double, blast double, “head to chest” doubles, and corner/angle finishes.  
  - Shows how stance, head position and hand fighting combine to create safe entry windows where opponent’s defensive options are limited.  
  - Emphasises carrying weight on a strong, weight-bearing stance instead of collapsing under sprawls, and repeatedly highlights that where you land after the double (hip and back control) is as important as the knockdown itself.

- **1.5 Volume 5 – Elbow-Deep Double Legs & Transition to Single Legs**  
  - Focuses on partially successful doubles where you get “elbow deep” but cannot immediately finish due to sprawls, posts or movement.  
  - Teaches how to link chest, head and elbows to the opponent’s thighs so you don’t get flattened or spun behind in these in-between moments.  
  - Systematises transitions from compromised double-legs into strong single-leg positions using angles, head position and leg switching rather than brute force.  
  - Reinforces the idea that modern jiu-jitsu takedowns must live in chains: double → single → back take or body lock, instead of isolated, all-or-nothing double attempts.

- **1.6 Volume 6 – Single-Leg Finishes & Single-to-Double Transitions**  
  - Builds a clear single-leg finishing tree for submission grappling: running the pipe, cutbacks, tight-waist cutbacks, thigh pry, trips and backside finishes.  
  - Specifies head and shoulder positioning for each finish and how to avoid exposing your own back as you circle, run the pipe or lift.  
  - Shows how and when to transition from single back to double on far or near side based on the opponent’s stance, whizzer and sprawl reactions.  
  - Argues that singles are not inherently weaker than doubles if the finishing logic is structured and that many stable scoring sequences come from cycling between single and double legs.

- **1.7 Volume 7 – High-Leg Finishes & Single-Leg Troubleshooting**  
  - Targets the common situation where you control a leg but the opponent is hopping, posting or lifting the leg high to create stalemates and counter threats.  
  - Systematises “high-leg” finishes: De Ashi-style trips, turning and lifting options, and transitions to backside finishes and body locks when the opponent turns.  
  - Provides specific answers to single-leg problems such as strong whizzers, sprawls, limp-legs and prolonged hopping battles where energy drains but no progress is made.  
  - Re-emphasises that high-level jiu-jitsu takedowns must convert leg control into hip and back control quickly if you want to avoid extended, low-percentage wrestling exchanges.

- **1.8 Volume 8 – Body Lock Takedowns & Leg-to-Torso Transitions**  
  - Elevates the body lock as a premier takedown family for submission grappling, especially after leg attacks have forced opponents upright into narrow stances.  
  - Explains body-lock entries from doubles and singles, from failed leg shots, and directly from dominant hand-fighting positions.  
  - Details finishes that prioritise chest-to-chest or chest-to-back connection: trip-based takedowns, mat returns, and backside finishes that immediately expose the back.  
  - Closes the system loop by showing how stance-breaking, snapdowns and leg attacks systematically funnel opponents into body-lock scenarios where counters are less dangerous and post-takedown control is highest.

## 2.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

- **2.1 Objectives of the Jiu-Jitsu Standing Game**  
  - Build a standing game that is specifically optimised for submission grappling, not for pure wrestling or judo rules: no reliance on referee resets, no assumption that a big throw is automatically good if it compromises position.  
  - Use standing exchanges to create predictable entries into strong ground positions: front headlocks, back exposure, body locks, and leg-dominant positions that immediately threaten passes or submissions.  
  - Minimise catastrophic failure modes from takedowns (giving up the back, falling into tight guards, exposing the neck or legs) by insisting on positional responsibility at every stage of the shot.  
  - Ensure that athletes who are “bottom players” still possess enough standing skill to survive, threaten and score when forced to start or restart on the feet.

- **2.2 Positional Ladder: Head, Hands, Hips & Legs**  
  - Head: win the head position battle first – aim for forehead/temple into their jaw, cheek or collarbone while avoiding neutral ear-to-ear ties; a superior head position narrows their stance, blocks their level change and opens lanes to legs and back.  
  - Hands: use hand fighting to clear inside ties, control wrists and elbows, then climb to dominant ties (collar ties, underhooks, two-on-one) that let you steer their stance and access the front leg without giving up easy counters.  
  - Hips: once head-and-hands are favourable, step your hips into ranges where you can safely carry or deflect their weight; the hips are the real engine of distance control, shot penetration and sprawl survival.  
  - Legs: only when head, hands and hips are in order do you fully commit to attacking the legs; leg tackles are treated as the final step in a ladder, not the first move in a sequence.

- **2.3 Takedown Families & Selection Logic**  
  - Front-headlock and snapdown sequences: low-risk stance-breaking tools that threaten guillotines and back takes while also exposing the front leg to doubles and singles; ideal as “first-line” offence and as punishment for poor posture.  
  - Double-leg family: the core leg-tackle family because controlling both legs and hips usually gives the cleanest path to ground control; favoured when you have good stance, angle and level change and can see the finish before you shoot.  
  - Single-leg family: the adaptive family for when doubles are partially blocked or when stance and angle naturally offer you one leg; heavily reliant on clear finishing trees and transitions to doubles, trips and body locks.  
  - Body-lock family: the “endgame” standing family in this system, often reached after your leg attacks force the opponent upright; chosen when you can get chest-to-chest or chest-to-back connections that are very hard to shake off and that lead directly into pins and back attacks.  
  - Selection principle: pick the takedown family that best matches the stance, distance and angle you actually have – the system discourages forcing favourite moves from bad contexts and instead teaches you to read the stance and choose accordingly.

- **2.4 Four-Phase Takedown Model (Setup–Catch–Connection–Completion)**  
  - Setup: use stance-breaking, snapdowns, hand fighting and angle creation to produce a brief window where your opponent’s stance is compromised (feet too close, weight too heavy, posture broken) and your head and hands are inside; shots taken without a real setup are treated as gambling.  
  - Catch: secure the initial control on the legs (knees, thighs, ankles) that prevents the opponent from simply stepping out or circling away – this includes the first bite on the front leg, elbow-deep penetration on doubles or initial hands on a single leg.  
  - Connection: improve the quality of your control by connecting chest, head, shoulders, elbows and hips to their legs and hips, turning the loose “catch” into a structured position that can carry sprawling weight and transition to other takedowns if needed.  
  - Completion: convert structural advantage into a score or dominant position by choosing the appropriate finish (cutback, run-the-pipe, trip, mat return, body lock finish, backside attack) that gets the opponent down without opening obvious counters; completion is judged not just by whether they hit the mat, but by whether you arrive in a controlling, scoring position.

- **2.5 Integration with Ground Systems & Scoring Priorities**  
  - Scoring lens: under jiu-jitsu criteria, a takedown is only as good as the control you establish once the opponent lands – this system constantly links standing choices to likely scoring outcomes (guard pass chances, back exposure, pinning potential).  
  - Guard-aware finishes: many finishes are deliberately biased to land you outside tight closed guard and dangerous leg entanglements, favouring angles and outcomes that drop you into half guard, headquarters, chest-to-back or top body-lock positions instead.  
  - Connection to submissions: preferred takedowns are those that naturally feed into guillotines, back takes, body triangles, leg locks or high-percentage pins, rather than takedowns that leave you in neutral, low-leverage positions.  
  - Cycle between phases of the fight: standing skills are treated as part of a continuous loop with guard, passing and back attack systems – you use your guard to stand up, your passing to force stand-ups and re-shots, and your takedowns to re-enter dominant ground phases, all within one coherent game plan.


## 3.0 CORE CONCEPTS

- **3.1 Risk Management in Jiu-Jitsu Takedowns**  
  - Takedowns in jiu-jitsu are high-risk because there are no referee resets and failed shots often land you in submissions, front headlocks, tight guards or leg entanglements.  
  - The system treats every shot as an investment that must pay off in positional advantage, not just a knockdown – “bad takedown into bad position” is worse than no takedown.  
  - Risk is controlled by insisting on four things before committed entries: solid stance, favourable head position, inside hand position and a clear structural setup (stance broken or angle achieved).  
  - Athletes are taught to think in chains rather than single attempts: a “failed” double that converts to a strong single or body lock with safe posture is not a failure, it is a redirected investment.

- **3.2 Stance, Level & Distance Management**  
  - Stance is built to satisfy three simultaneous demands: defensive responsibility (not easy to take down or snap into front headlock), offensive potential (can level change and drive) and vision (can read level and angle changes).  
  - The chest should rarely travel beyond the toes; weight-bearing stance means you can carry opponent’s weight on your legs and hips rather than folding at the waist and collapsing under sprawls.  
  - Level changes are small, efficient drops rooted in knee and hip bend rather than huge “drop to the floor” movements; you should be able to recover back to stance quickly if the shot is withdrawn.  
  - Distance management is framed as avoiding two extremes: being so far that only desperate, telegraphed shots are possible, and so close that you are constantly in danger of throws or snapdowns without your own grips or head position.

- **3.3 Head Position & Angular Advantage**  
  - Head position is treated as a primary positional metric: neutral head-to-head or ear-to-ear ties are considered 50/50; the goal is to move to angles where your forehead or temple is inside their jawline, cheek or collarbone.  
  - A superior head position narrows their stance, limits their ability to change level cleanly and opens a lane for your shoulders and hips to follow into doubles, singles or body locks.  
  - Danaher repeatedly stresses that your head should help you carry and redirect opponent’s weight; if all the weight is on your neck and lower back, the structure is wrong even if the grips look correct.  
  - Angular advantage is built by combining head position with footwork: step to the side where your head is already strong, turn your shoulders to face the opponent’s hips, and avoid straight-line collisions that rely purely on speed or surprise.

- **3.4 Hand Fighting, Thumb Position & Elbow Discipline**  
  - Hand fighting is reframed as a systematic hunt for inside control: get your hands and forearms inside their forearms and elbows, then climb to dominant ties (collar ties, underhooks, two-on-one) that let you steer their stance.  
  - Thumb and wrist position matter: gripping in ways that keep your elbows in and your hands active allows you to strip their grips without overreaching or exposing your own neck and arms to snaps or arm drags.  
  - Elbow discipline is a core safety rule – flared elbows give opponents easy access to arm drags, underhooks, body locks and front headlocks; elbows-in posture protects ribs, hips and neck while still allowing you to reach for legs when the time is right.  
  - Every hand-fighting exchange is supposed to move the positional needle: either improve your head and hand position, break their stance, create a lane to the legs, or set a trap for a snapdown or front headlock – static grip fighting is strongly discouraged.

- **3.5 Snapdown as the “Jab” of Standing Grappling**  
  - Snapdowns are treated as the jab: they are not expected to end the exchange by themselves, but they constantly disrupt stance, draw reactions and create openings for stronger attacks.  
  - Good snapdowns combine a controlled collar tie, head position and short, sharp drops of your level with steps that keep your hips under you; you should be able to snap, recover and snap again without losing balance or burning out.  
  - Snapdowns serve three main roles: to move the opponent’s feet and force stance changes, to expose the neck and front headlock for guillotines and back takes, and to pull the front leg into range for doubles and singles.  
  - The system encourages high snapdown volume in sparring because it forces the opponent to constantly re-square, which makes their level changes and shots predictable and easier to counter.

- **3.6 Breaking Stance: Three Paths to Dominance**  
  - The core standing objective is to break the opponent’s stance; as long as their stance is intact, both their offence and defence are structurally sound.  
  - Danaher organises stance-breaking into three main paths:  
    - Hands to the mat: snapdowns and shucks that force their hands toward the floor, making level changes and front headlocks easy while dramatically slowing their movement.  
    - Winning outside the elbows: getting your head and hands inside their arms and then driving outside the elbows so their arms cannot meaningfully block your level change or protect their hips.  
    - Creating head-and-shoulder lanes: using angles and head position to open clean lanes to their hips and legs where your shoulders lead and your hands and head follow without getting tied up.  
  - A “neutral” tie where both players stand tall with symmetrical grips and clean stance is viewed as tactically sterile; the system pushes you to continuously chase one of the three stance-breaking paths.

- **3.7 Rule-Set Effects on Takedown Choice & Emphasis**  
  - In IBJJF-style or points-oriented formats, takedowns are evaluated primarily by post-takedown control; this bias favours doubles, singles and body locks that land you outside closed guard and in strong passing positions.  
  - In submission-only or ADCC-style formats, there is more tolerance for scramble-heavy entries as long as they reliably lead to back takes, front headlocks or leg attacks; still, the system warns against overly speculative shots that repeatedly give top position away.  
  - Rules about guard pulling and stand-up resets influence strategy: when guard pulls are allowed, your standing goal may be to threaten takedowns enough that opponents pull into guards you want to pass; when stand-ups are frequent, your takedowns must be efficient enough to survive multiple attempts per match.  
  - Across all rulesets, the central principle remains: pick takedown families and finishes that are robust under that format’s scoring and restart rules, and never separate the decision to shoot from the expected ground position and scoring outcome that will follow.
 
## 4.0 TECHNIQUE LIBRARY

- **4.1 Volume 1 Techniques – Stance, Motion & First Contact**  
  - Stance construction and alignment: neutral stance, left-lead vs right-lead stance, square stance, “weight-bearing” stance with chest over base and head carried on forehead/temple instead of the back of the skull.  
  - Basic motion drills: stance-preserving forward/backward/sideways steps, stance switches without crossing feet, “shadow wrestling” entries that maintain level and defensive responsibility.  
  - Level-change mechanics: shallow and deep level changes from stance using hip and knee bend (no waist collapse), level change recovery back to stance, fake level changes as feints.  
  - First-contact options: collar-tie entries off reaching jabs or posts, inside tie from wrist control, initial head position battles (forehead to forehead vs ear to ear), safe frames against aggressive collar ties or snap attempts.  
  - Inside-position templates: double inside biceps control, inside wrist-and-biceps control, head inside opponent’s arms, and transitions from neutral hand fighting into these inside-dominant positions.

- **4.2 Volume 2 Techniques – Hand Fighting Systems & Dominant Ties**  
  - Wrist-control sequences: cross-wrist and same-side wrist grabs leading to inside biceps, drag threats and first snaps, plus defensive wrist pummelling and strip mechanics.  
  - Collar-tie system: building a strong collar tie with head close and elbow in, breaking posture from the tie, and using it as a hub for snapdowns, shucks and front-leg exposure.  
  - Underhook / overhook entries: pummelling drills for underhooks, overhooks as defensive and offensive tools, underhook-to-body-lock pathways, overhook to snap or throw-by sequences.  
  - Two-on-one / Russian tie: collecting a two-on-one from wrist and elbow, steering stance with a Russian, exposing the back or front leg, transitions to single legs and body locks.  
  - Dominant-position protocols: transitions from neutral ties to dominant head-and-hands positions, criteria for when a tie is “good enough” to shoot, and quick reset mechanics when ties are broken.

- **4.3 Volume 3 Techniques – Snapdowns & Front-Leg Takedown Entries**  
  - Core snapdown mechanics: collar-tie snap, two-on-one snap, inside-biceps snap; synchronising level change, step and pull so that opponent’s hands are driven toward the mat without compromising your stance.  
  - Front headlock entries: snap-to-front-headlock transitions, front headlock stabilization in no-gi, immediate follow-ups (spin behind, sit-through, throw-by) that respect guillotine/back-take threats.  
  - Stance-breaking variants: repeated light snaps to move feet and destabilise stance, hard snaps that threaten near-falls, snap-to-angle steps that open one side of the body for leg entries.  
  - Front-leg exposure entries: using the snap to bring the front leg close, collar-tie-to-knee-tap attacks, snap-to-low-single style entries, and snap-to-penetration-step doubles where the head stays high and posture preserved.  
  - Continuous-snap drills: high-rep snapdown rounds where the aim is not to finish but to constantly reset stance-breaking, forcing predictable reactions for later takedown chains.

- **4.4 Volume 4 Techniques – Core Double-Leg Variations & Setups**  
  - Penetration double: classic penetration step with knee penetration, shoulder-to-hip alignment, trail leg recovery, and head position for no-gi (ear inside ribs, posture strong).  
  - Blast double: straight-line blast from close range when posture and stance are already broken, emphasising hip drive through the opponent and immediate angle change upon contact to avoid counters.  
  - Angle double and corner finishes: doubles taken off an outside step, turning the corner as soon as hands lock behind the knees or thighs, cut-the-corner finishes that avoid front headlocks.  
  - Defensive-integrated doubles: “safe entry” doubles built off strong collar ties, inside position and snap reactions, including doubles where you never put a knee on the mat to reduce exposure to sprawls and front headlocks.  
  - Finishing templates: drive-to-fence finishes (for wall/cage contexts), mat-return style doubles where you stand up with the legs and return them to the mat, and knee-shelf sequences that lead into immediate guard-passing or body-lock pins.

- **4.5 Volume 5 Techniques – Elbow-Deep Doubles & Double-to-Single Transitions**  
  - Elbow-deep entry positions: techniques for locking your arms deep around one or both legs even when penetration is incomplete, with emphasis on connecting elbows to ribs and chest to thighs.  
  - Anti-sprawl mechanics: “hip under” adjustments that move your hips under their hips, small back-steps and angle changes to prevent being flattened, and shuck-outs from near-sprawl positions.  
  - Double-to-single transitions: when one leg slips, turning into strong single legs (inside single, outside single, high-crotch style positions), with head position and grip changes spelled out.  
  - Re-shot sequences: initial double that fails to finish, retreating back to stance without conceding front headlock, and immediate re-entry to double or single when opponent over-commits to counter.  
  - Chain-design examples: elbow-deep double → angle change → lift one leg to single → run-the-pipe or cutback, with explicit criteria for when to switch and when to keep driving the double.

- **4.6 Volume 6 Techniques – Single-Leg Mechanics & Finishing Options**  
  - Basic single-leg entries: inside single from hand fighting, outside single from stance and angle, and transitions from failed doubles into singles on near or far leg.  
  - Fundamental finishes: classic run-the-pipe finish with correct head and shoulder position, single-leg cutback that turns opponent’s hips away, and tight-waist cutbacks that link directly to back exposure.  
  - Trip-based and foot-sweep finishes: heel block trips, inside and outside foot sweeps from single-leg control, and “push-pull” finishes that use your shoulder and head to topple the base.  
  - Thigh-pry and lift finishes: lifting the leg to hip height, prying the thigh with your forearm and elbow, walking them backward and sideways into mat returns, and connecting to body locks when they turn.  
  - Single-to-double transitions: recognising when opponent’s stance encourages switching to doubles (far leg too close, hips square), stepping and adjusting your grip to wrap both legs, then finishing with the double-leg templates from earlier volumes.

- **4.7 Volume 7 Techniques – High-Leg Finishes & Single-Leg Troubleshooting**  
  - High-leg control: structured methods for controlling a leg that is lifted high (either by you or by the opponent) without exposing your own back or neck, including shoulder position and head placement.  
  - High-leg finishing chains: De Ashi Harai-style sweeps, running them in circles to destroy balance, steering them into the “dead angle” for easy trips, and turning their high knee into a back-exposure opportunity.  
  - Whizzer and sprawl counters: techniques for clearing a strong whizzer (swim-outs, limp-arms, shoulder turns), transitioning to body locks, and countering sprawls by pivoting to backside finishes or reshooting under.  
  - Limp-leg and granby responses: staying attached when opponent tries to “limp leg” out of singles or spin through with granby-style rolls, catching the far hip or transitioning to doubles or back takes as they turn.  
  - Stalemate-breaking protocols: when stuck in long hopping battles, sequences that deliberately shift from leg dominance to hip or back dominance so you do not waste energy in low-percentage positions.

- **4.8 Volume 8 Techniques – Body Lock Entries, Finishes & Transitions**  
  - Body-lock entries from leg attacks: collecting a body lock after failed or partially finished doubles and singles (chasing the hips instead of the legs when they defend), including transitions from thigh control to full torso control.  
  - Direct body-lock entries from ties: underhook-and-collar, double-underhooks, and Russian-tie-to-body-lock sequences that exploit broken stance or overreactions to snapdowns.  
  - Inside-trip and outside-trip finishes: classic inside and outside trips from body locks with emphasis on hip-to-hip and chest-to-chest connection, plus small-step footwork that protects your own base.  
  - Mat-returns and lift finishes: lifting the opponent from a body lock, stepping them away from the hips, and returning them to the mat in ways that land you in strong top control (side control, half guard, or back control) rather than loose scrambles.  
  - Back-exposure transitions: taking the back directly from body locks when opponent turns hard to escape, using knee blocks and hip switches to land in seatbelt and hooks, and linking mat returns to immediate back-take sequences on the ground.

    body lock / back take, etc.)
                 |
                 v
     [GROUND POSITION / SCORE]
 (guard, half guard, side, back, etc.)

Notes: every double, single or body-lock entry is evaluated against this
four-step flow. Bad shots usually skip setup, fail to catch, or try to
“finish” without real connection.

### 5.3 Head & Hand Positioning Lanes

Top view of lanes:

      OPPONENT
     (facing you)
        _________
       |   H   H |   H = head
       | A  N  A |   N = neutral lane
       |__D___D__|   A = angle lanes
            ^
            |
          YOU

Vertical slice:

         [BAD / NEUTRAL LANES]
   ear-to-ear, tall stance, no angle
                 |
                 v
         [BETTER HEAD LANES]
   forehead/temple to jaw / cheek /
        collarbone on one side
                 |
                 v
         [BEST ATTACK LANES]
  head inside arms + hands inside
   elbows + angle to near or far leg

Notes: idea is to leave neutral lanes (square, head-to-head) and occupy
angled head lanes plus inside-hand lanes that let you reach legs and
hips without being tied up.

### 5.4 Double-Leg Variation Tree

                   [DOUBLE-LEG FAMILY]
                            |
        -----------------------------------------
        |                 |                     |
  [PENETRATION]      [BLAST DOUBLE]      [ANGLE / CORNER]
        |                 |                     |
   standard knee     close-range           doubles taken
    penetration       power shot           off angle step
        |                 |                     |

[DRIVE] [CUTBACK]  [BLAST TO] [WALL /] [CUT CORNER] [LIFT /
       (turn)       SIDE /    FENCE     (turn hips    MAT
                   BACKSTEP   FINISH     early)      RETURN]

Landing preferences:

   [DOUBLE FINISH] --> [HALF / HQ / SIDE / BODY LOCK] > [BACK]

Notes: tree shows main double entries and typical finishes, all judged
by where you land on the ground (avoid falling straight into tight closed
guard if possible).

### 5.5 Single-Leg & High-Leg Finishing Tree

                   [SINGLE-LEG CONTROL]
                             |
         ----------------------------------------
         |               |                     |
   [STANDARD]       [TRIP / SWEEP]       [HIGH-LEG MODE]
         |               |                     |
  run pipe /         heel block /       leg lifted high,
   cutback         inside / outside        hopping
         |               |                     |
   ------ ------     -----------       -------------------
   |          |      |         |       |        |       |
[HIP-TO-HIP] [BACK] [OFF-BAL] [FALL] [TRIPS] [TURN] [BODY
  finishes   angles   + pass   to mat   /    BACK   LOCK /
   (side,     (back             with   SWEEPS  EXPOSE  BACK]
  half, etc.)  takes)         control]

Notes: single-leg control can lead to classic low finishes, trip-based
finishes, or the specialised “high-leg” branch, which aims to break
stalemates by forcing falls, trips or direct transitions to the back or
body locks.

### 5.6 Leg-Attack to Body-Lock Transition Map

      [LEG ATTACKS]
 (double / single / high-crotch)
              |
   -------------------------
   |                       |
[GOOD LEG GRIP]     [LEGS DEFENDED]
 (deep, feet heavy)   (sprawl / limp-leg /
                      hands on your head)
   |                       |
   v                       v
[FINISH ON LEGS]     [CHASE THE HIPS]
 (direct cutback,      (switch focus
  run pipe, etc.)       from legs to
                        torso / back)
                              |
                     --------------------
                     |                  |
                [SIDE BODY LOCK]   [REAR BODY LOCK]
                     |                  |

                     |                  |
                     v                  v
              [TOP CONTROL]       [BACK CONTROL]

Notes: once opponents defend your doubles and singles well, the system
encourages switching the attack from their legs to their hips and torso,
climbing to body locks that lead to more stable top or back control.
