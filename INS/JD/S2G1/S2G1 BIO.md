## 1.0 INSTRUCTIONAL VOLUME CONTENT

- **1.1 Volume 1 – Standing Preliminaries: Stance, Motion & Takedown Priorities**  
  - Frames takedowns in jiu-jitsu as high-risk actions because there are no standing resets and failed shots lead directly into submissions and scrambles.  
  - Introduces the four big ideas of the series: avoid carrying opponent’s weight, progress from easier to harder takedowns, hand fight with direction, and always account for the aftermath of a takedown.  
  - Builds the foundational stance model (defensive responsibility, offensive potential, vision) plus same-side vs opposite-side stances and basic movement.  
  - Covers first contact and initial grips, finishing with the principle of getting your head and hands inside the opponent’s elbows as the gateway to all later attacks.

- **1.2 Volume 2 – Hand Fighting Principles & Dominant Standing Position**  
  - Redefines hand fighting as “head-and-hands fighting,” not random grip slapping, and emphasises that every grip should move you towards a better position.  
  - Defines neutral, bad and dominant standing positions in terms of head placement, elbow line and grip priorities.  
  - Builds a hierarchy of ties (collar ties, underhooks, overhooks, wrist and biceps control) and shows how to use them to steer stance, expose the front leg and protect against level changes.  
  - Stresses that hand fighting must always have directional intent: towards angles that open lanes to legs, to the back, or into front headlocks, instead of static 50/50 grip exchanges.

- **1.3 Volume 3 – Snapdowns & the Front-Leg Takedown Framework**  
  - Establishes snapdowns as the “jab” of the standing game: a repeatable, relatively low-risk action that moves feet, breaks stance and starts your offence.  
  - Details mechanics of effective snapdowns (head position, elbow angle, footwork, timing) and connects them to front headlocks and front-leg exposure.  
  - Introduces the four-phase model for front-leg tackles: setup, catch, connection, completion, and uses it to structure all front-leg takedowns.  
  - Links stance-breaking ideas (hands to mat, outside the elbows, head-and-shoulder lanes) directly into specific takedown entries instead of treating them as abstract concepts.

- **1.4 Volume 4 – Double Leg Takedowns: Variants, Setups & Distance Entries**  
  - Builds a complete double-leg system using the four phases, starting from short-range, high-control setups and only later adding true distance shots.  
  - Covers key double-leg variants: standard penetration double, blast double, “head to chest” doubles, and corner/angle finishes.  
  - Shows how stance, head position and hand fighting combine to create safe entry windows where opponent’s defensive options are limited.  
  - Emphasises carrying weight on a strong, weight-bearing stance instead of collapsing under sprawls, and repeatedly highlights that where you land after the double (hip and back control) is as important as the knockdown itself.

- **1.5 Volume 5 – Elbow-Deep Double Legs & Transition to Single Legs**  
  - Focuses on partially successful doubles where you get “elbow deep” but cannot immediately finish due to sprawls, posts or movement.  
  - Teaches how to link chest, head and elbows to the opponent’s thighs so you don’t get flattened or spun behind in these in-between moments.  
  - Systematises transitions from compromised double-legs into strong single-leg positions using angles, head position and leg switching rather than brute force.  
  - Reinforces the idea that modern jiu-jitsu takedowns must live in chains: double → single → back take or body lock, instead of isolated, all-or-nothing double attempts.

- **1.6 Volume 6 – Single-Leg Finishes & Single-to-Double Transitions**  
  - Builds a clear single-leg finishing tree for submission grappling: running the pipe, cutbacks, tight-waist cutbacks, thigh pry, trips and backside finishes.  
  - Specifies head and shoulder positioning for each finish and how to avoid exposing your own back as you circle, run the pipe or lift.  
  - Shows how and when to transition from single back to double on far or near side based on the opponent’s stance, whizzer and sprawl reactions.  
  - Argues that singles are not inherently weaker than doubles if the finishing logic is structured and that many stable scoring sequences come from cycling between single and double legs.

- **1.7 Volume 7 – High-Leg Finishes & Single-Leg Troubleshooting**  
  - Targets the common situation where you control a leg but the opponent is hopping, posting or lifting the leg high to create stalemates and counter threats.  
  - Systematises “high-leg” finishes: De Ashi-style trips, turning and lifting options, and transitions to backside finishes and body locks when the opponent turns.  
  - Provides specific answers to single-leg problems such as strong whizzers, sprawls, limp-legs and prolonged hopping battles where energy drains but no progress is made.  
  - Re-emphasises that high-level jiu-jitsu takedowns must convert leg control into hip and back control quickly if you want to avoid extended, low-percentage wrestling exchanges.

- **1.8 Volume 8 – Body Lock Takedowns & Leg-to-Torso Transitions**  
  - Elevates the body lock as a premier takedown family for submission grappling, especially after leg attacks have forced opponents upright into narrow stances.  
  - Explains body-lock entries from doubles and singles, from failed leg shots, and directly from dominant hand-fighting positions.  
  - Details finishes that prioritise chest-to-chest or chest-to-back connection: trip-based takedowns, mat returns, and backside finishes that immediately expose the back.  
  - Closes the system loop by showing how stance-breaking, snapdowns and leg attacks systematically funnel opponents into body-lock scenarios where counters are less dangerous and post-takedown control is highest.

## 2.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

- **2.1 Objectives of the Jiu-Jitsu Standing Game**  
  - Build a standing game that is specifically optimised for submission grappling, not for pure wrestling or judo rules: no reliance on referee resets, no assumption that a big throw is automatically good if it compromises position.  
  - Use standing exchanges to create predictable entries into strong ground positions: front headlocks, back exposure, body locks, and leg-dominant positions that immediately threaten passes or submissions.  
  - Minimise catastrophic failure modes from takedowns (giving up the back, falling into tight guards, exposing the neck or legs) by insisting on positional responsibility at every stage of the shot.  
  - Ensure that athletes who are “bottom players” still possess enough standing skill to survive, threaten and score when forced to start or restart on the feet.

- **2.2 Positional Ladder: Head, Hands, Hips & Legs**  
  - Head: win the head position battle first – aim for forehead/temple into their jaw, cheek or collarbone while avoiding neutral ear-to-ear ties; a superior head position narrows their stance, blocks their level change and opens lanes to legs and back.  
  - Hands: use hand fighting to clear inside ties, control wrists and elbows, then climb to dominant ties (collar ties, underhooks, two-on-one) that let you steer their stance and access the front leg without giving up easy counters.  
  - Hips: once head-and-hands are favourable, step your hips into ranges where you can safely carry or deflect their weight; the hips are the real engine of distance control, shot penetration and sprawl survival.  
  - Legs: only when head, hands and hips are in order do you fully commit to attacking the legs; leg tackles are treated as the final step in a ladder, not the first move in a sequence.

- **2.3 Takedown Families & Selection Logic**  
  - Front-headlock and snapdown sequences: low-risk stance-breaking tools that threaten guillotines and back takes while also exposing the front leg to doubles and singles; ideal as “first-line” offence and as punishment for poor posture.  
  - Double-leg family: the core leg-tackle family because controlling both legs and hips usually gives the cleanest path to ground control; favoured when you have good stance, angle and level change and can see the finish before you shoot.  
  - Single-leg family: the adaptive family for when doubles are partially blocked or when stance and angle naturally offer you one leg; heavily reliant on clear finishing trees and transitions to doubles, trips and body locks.  
  - Body-lock family: the “endgame” standing family in this system, often reached after your leg attacks force the opponent upright; chosen when you can get chest-to-chest or chest-to-back connections that are very hard to shake off and that lead directly into pins and back attacks.  
  - Selection principle: pick the takedown family that best matches the stance, distance and angle you actually have – the system discourages forcing favourite moves from bad contexts and instead teaches you to read the stance and choose accordingly.

- **2.4 Four-Phase Takedown Model (Setup–Catch–Connection–Completion)**  
  - Setup: use stance-breaking, snapdowns, hand fighting and angle creation to produce a brief window where your opponent’s stance is compromised (feet too close, weight too heavy, posture broken) and your head and hands are inside; shots taken without a real setup are treated as gambling.  
  - Catch: secure the initial control on the legs (knees, thighs, ankles) that prevents the opponent from simply stepping out or circling away – this includes the first bite on the front leg, elbow-deep penetration on doubles or initial hands on a single leg.  
  - Connection: improve the quality of your control by connecting chest, head, shoulders, elbows and hips to their legs and hips, turning the loose “catch” into a structured position that can carry sprawling weight and transition to other takedowns if needed.  
  - Completion: convert structural advantage into a score or dominant position by choosing the appropriate finish (cutback, run-the-pipe, trip, mat return, body lock finish, backside attack) that gets the opponent down without opening obvious counters; completion is judged not just by whether they hit the mat, but by whether you arrive in a controlling, scoring position.

- **2.5 Integration with Ground Systems & Scoring Priorities**  
  - Scoring lens: under jiu-jitsu criteria, a takedown is only as good as the control you establish once the opponent lands – this system constantly links standing choices to likely scoring outcomes (guard pass chances, back exposure, pinning potential).  
  - Guard-aware finishes: many finishes are deliberately biased to land you outside tight closed guard and dangerous leg entanglements, favouring angles and outcomes that drop you into half guard, headquarters, chest-to-back or top body-lock positions instead.  
  - Connection to submissions: preferred takedowns are those that naturally feed into guillotines, back takes, body triangles, leg locks or high-percentage pins, rather than takedowns that leave you in neutral, low-leverage positions.  
  - Cycle between phases of the fight: standing skills are treated as part of a continuous loop with guard, passing and back attack systems – you use your guard to stand up, your passing to force stand-ups and re-shots, and your takedowns to re-enter dominant ground phases, all within one coherent game plan.


## 3.0 CORE CONCEPTS

- **3.1 Risk Management in Jiu-Jitsu Takedowns**  
  - Takedowns in jiu-jitsu are high-risk because there are no referee resets and failed shots often land you in submissions, front headlocks, tight guards or leg entanglements.  
  - The system treats every shot as an investment that must pay off in positional advantage, not just a knockdown – “bad takedown into bad position” is worse than no takedown.  
  - Risk is controlled by insisting on four things before committed entries: solid stance, favourable head position, inside hand position and a clear structural setup (stance broken or angle achieved).  
  - Athletes are taught to think in chains rather than single attempts: a “failed” double that converts to a strong single or body lock with safe posture is not a failure, it is a redirected investment.

- **3.2 Stance, Level & Distance Management**  
  - Stance is built to satisfy three simultaneous demands: defensive responsibility (not easy to take down or snap into front headlock), offensive potential (can level change and drive) and vision (can read level and angle changes).  
  - The chest should rarely travel beyond the toes; weight-bearing stance means you can carry opponent’s weight on your legs and hips rather than folding at the waist and collapsing under sprawls.  
  - Level changes are small, efficient drops rooted in knee and hip bend rather than huge “drop to the floor” movements; you should be able to recover back to stance quickly if the shot is withdrawn.  
  - Distance management is framed as avoiding two extremes: being so far that only desperate, telegraphed shots are possible, and so close that you are constantly in danger of throws or snapdowns without your own grips or head position.

- **3.3 Head Position & Angular Advantage**  
  - Head position is treated as a primary positional metric: neutral head-to-head or ear-to-ear ties are considered 50/50; the goal is to move to angles where your forehead or temple is inside their jawline, cheek or collarbone.  
  - A superior head position narrows their stance, limits their ability to change level cleanly and opens a lane for your shoulders and hips to follow into doubles, singles or body locks.  
  - Danaher repeatedly stresses that your head should help you carry and redirect opponent’s weight; if all the weight is on your neck and lower back, the structure is wrong even if the grips look correct.  
  - Angular advantage is built by combining head position with footwork: step to the side where your head is already strong, turn your shoulders to face the opponent’s hips, and avoid straight-line collisions that rely purely on speed or surprise.

- **3.4 Hand Fighting, Thumb Position & Elbow Discipline**  
  - Hand fighting is reframed as a systematic hunt for inside control: get your hands and forearms inside their forearms and elbows, then climb to dominant ties (collar ties, underhooks, two-on-one) that let you steer their stance.  
  - Thumb and wrist position matter: gripping in ways that keep your elbows in and your hands active allows you to strip their grips without overreaching or exposing your own neck and arms to snaps or arm drags.  
  - Elbow discipline is a core safety rule – flared elbows give opponents easy access to arm drags, underhooks, body locks and front headlocks; elbows-in posture protects ribs, hips and neck while still allowing you to reach for legs when the time is right.  
  - Every hand-fighting exchange is supposed to move the positional needle: either improve your head and hand position, break their stance, create a lane to the legs, or set a trap for a snapdown or front headlock – static grip fighting is strongly discouraged.

- **3.5 Snapdown as the “Jab” of Standing Grappling**  
  - Snapdowns are treated as the jab: they are not expected to end the exchange by themselves, but they constantly disrupt stance, draw reactions and create openings for stronger attacks.  
  - Good snapdowns combine a controlled collar tie, head position and short, sharp drops of your level with steps that keep your hips under you; you should be able to snap, recover and snap again without losing balance or burning out.  
  - Snapdowns serve three main roles: to move the opponent’s feet and force stance changes, to expose the neck and front headlock for guillotines and back takes, and to pull the front leg into range for doubles and singles.  
  - The system encourages high snapdown volume in sparring because it forces the opponent to constantly re-square, which makes their level changes and shots predictable and easier to counter.

- **3.6 Breaking Stance: Three Paths to Dominance**  
  - The core standing objective is to break the opponent’s stance; as long as their stance is intact, both their offence and defence are structurally sound.  
  - Danaher organises stance-breaking into three main paths:  
    - Hands to the mat: snapdowns and shucks that force their hands toward the floor, making level changes and front headlocks easy while dramatically slowing their movement.  
    - Winning outside the elbows: getting your head and hands inside their arms and then driving outside the elbows so their arms cannot meaningfully block your level change or protect their hips.  
    - Creating head-and-shoulder lanes: using angles and head position to open clean lanes to their hips and legs where your shoulders lead and your hands and head follow without getting tied up.  
  - A “neutral” tie where both players stand tall with symmetrical grips and clean stance is viewed as tactically sterile; the system pushes you to continuously chase one of the three stance-breaking paths.

- **3.7 Rule-Set Effects on Takedown Choice & Emphasis**  
  - In IBJJF-style or points-oriented formats, takedowns are evaluated primarily by post-takedown control; this bias favours doubles, singles and body locks that land you outside closed guard and in strong passing positions.  
  - In submission-only or ADCC-style formats, there is more tolerance for scramble-heavy entries as long as they reliably lead to back takes, front headlocks or leg attacks; still, the system warns against overly speculative shots that repeatedly give top position away.  
  - Rules about guard pulling and stand-up resets influence strategy: when guard pulls are allowed, your standing goal may be to threaten takedowns enough that opponents pull into guards you want to pass; when stand-ups are frequent, your takedowns must be efficient enough to survive multiple attempts per match.  
  - Across all rulesets, the central principle remains: pick takedown families and finishes that are robust under that format’s scoring and restart rules, and never separate the decision to shoot from the expected ground position and scoring outcome that will follow.
 
## 4.0 TECHNIQUE LIBRARY

- **4.1 Volume 1 Techniques – Stance, Motion & First Contact**  
  - Stance construction and alignment: neutral stance, left-lead vs right-lead stance, square stance, “weight-bearing” stance with chest over base and head carried on forehead/temple instead of the back of the skull.  
  - Basic motion drills: stance-preserving forward/backward/sideways steps, stance switches without crossing feet, “shadow wrestling” entries that maintain level and defensive responsibility.  
  - Level-change mechanics: shallow and deep level changes from stance using hip and knee bend (no waist collapse), level change recovery back to stance, fake level changes as feints.  
  - First-contact options: collar-tie entries off reaching jabs or posts, inside tie from wrist control, initial head position battles (forehead to forehead vs ear to ear), safe frames against aggressive collar ties or snap attempts.  
  - Inside-position templates: double inside biceps control, inside wrist-and-biceps control, head inside opponent’s arms, and transitions from neutral hand fighting into these inside-dominant positions.

- **4.2 Volume 2 Techniques – Hand Fighting Systems & Dominant Ties**  
  - Wrist-control sequences: cross-wrist and same-side wrist grabs leading to inside biceps, drag threats and first snaps, plus defensive wrist pummelling and strip mechanics.  
  - Collar-tie system: building a strong collar tie with head close and elbow in, breaking posture from the tie, and using it as a hub for snapdowns, shucks and front-leg exposure.  
  - Underhook / overhook entries: pummelling drills for underhooks, overhooks as defensive and offensive tools, underhook-to-body-lock pathways, overhook to snap or throw-by sequences.  
  - Two-on-one / Russian tie: collecting a two-on-one from wrist and elbow, steering stance with a Russian, exposing the back or front leg, transitions to single legs and body locks.  
  - Dominant-position protocols: transitions from neutral ties to dominant head-and-hands positions, criteria for when a tie is “good enough” to shoot, and quick reset mechanics when ties are broken.

- **4.3 Volume 3 Techniques – Snapdowns & Front-Leg Takedown Entries**  
  - Core snapdown mechanics: collar-tie snap, two-on-one snap, inside-biceps snap; synchronising level change, step and pull so that opponent’s hands are driven toward the mat without compromising your stance.  
  - Front headlock entries: snap-to-front-headlock transitions, front headlock stabilization in no-gi, immediate follow-ups (spin behind, sit-through, throw-by) that respect guillotine/back-take threats.  
  - Stance-breaking variants: repeated light snaps to move feet and destabilise stance, hard snaps that threaten near-falls, snap-to-angle steps that open one side of the body for leg entries.  
  - Front-leg exposure entries: using the snap to bring the front leg close, collar-tie-to-knee-tap attacks, snap-to-low-single style entries, and snap-to-penetration-step doubles where the head stays high and posture preserved.  
  - Continuous-snap drills: high-rep snapdown rounds where the aim is not to finish but to constantly reset stance-breaking, forcing predictable reactions for later takedown chains.

- **4.4 Volume 4 Techniques – Core Double-Leg Variations & Setups**  
  - Penetration double: classic penetration step with knee penetration, shoulder-to-hip alignment, trail leg recovery, and head position for no-gi (ear inside ribs, posture strong).  
  - Blast double: straight-line blast from close range when posture and stance are already broken, emphasising hip drive through the opponent and immediate angle change upon contact to avoid counters.  
  - Angle double and corner finishes: doubles taken off an outside step, turning the corner as soon as hands lock behind the knees or thighs, cut-the-corner finishes that avoid front headlocks.  
  - Defensive-integrated doubles: “safe entry” doubles built off strong collar ties, inside position and snap reactions, including doubles where you never put a knee on the mat to reduce exposure to sprawls and front headlocks.  
  - Finishing templates: drive-to-fence finishes (for wall/cage contexts), mat-return style doubles where you stand up with the legs and return them to the mat, and knee-shelf sequences that lead into immediate guard-passing or body-lock pins.

- **4.5 Volume 5 Techniques – Elbow-Deep Doubles & Double-to-Single Transitions**  
  - Elbow-deep entry positions: techniques for locking your arms deep around one or both legs even when penetration is incomplete, with emphasis on connecting elbows to ribs and chest to thighs.  
  - Anti-sprawl mechanics: “hip under” adjustments that move your hips under their hips, small back-steps and angle changes to prevent being flattened, and shuck-outs from near-sprawl positions.  
  - Double-to-single transitions: when one leg slips, turning into strong single legs (inside single, outside single, high-crotch style positions), with head position and grip changes spelled out.  
  - Re-shot sequences: initial double that fails to finish, retreating back to stance without conceding front headlock, and immediate re-entry to double or single when opponent over-commits to counter.  
  - Chain-design examples: elbow-deep double → angle change → lift one leg to single → run-the-pipe or cutback, with explicit criteria for when to switch and when to keep driving the double.

- **4.6 Volume 6 Techniques – Single-Leg Mechanics & Finishing Options**  
  - Basic single-leg entries: inside single from hand fighting, outside single from stance and angle, and transitions from failed doubles into singles on near or far leg.  
  - Fundamental finishes: classic run-the-pipe finish with correct head and shoulder position, single-leg cutback that turns opponent’s hips away, and tight-waist cutbacks that link directly to back exposure.  
  - Trip-based and foot-sweep finishes: heel block trips, inside and outside foot sweeps from single-leg control, and “push-pull” finishes that use your shoulder and head to topple the base.  
  - Thigh-pry and lift finishes: lifting the leg to hip height, prying the thigh with your forearm and elbow, walking them backward and sideways into mat returns, and connecting to body locks when they turn.  
  - Single-to-double transitions: recognising when opponent’s stance encourages switching to doubles (far leg too close, hips square), stepping and adjusting your grip to wrap both legs, then finishing with the double-leg templates from earlier volumes.

- **4.7 Volume 7 Techniques – High-Leg Finishes & Single-Leg Troubleshooting**  
  - High-leg control: structured methods for controlling a leg that is lifted high (either by you or by the opponent) without exposing your own back or neck, including shoulder position and head placement.  
  - High-leg finishing chains: De Ashi Harai-style sweeps, running them in circles to destroy balance, steering them into the “dead angle” for easy trips, and turning their high knee into a back-exposure opportunity.  
  - Whizzer and sprawl counters: techniques for clearing a strong whizzer (swim-outs, limp-arms, shoulder turns), transitioning to body locks, and countering sprawls by pivoting to backside finishes or reshooting under.  
  - Limp-leg and granby responses: staying attached when opponent tries to “limp leg” out of singles or spin through with granby-style rolls, catching the far hip or transitioning to doubles or back takes as they turn.  
  - Stalemate-breaking protocols: when stuck in long hopping battles, sequences that deliberately shift from leg dominance to hip or back dominance so you do not waste energy in low-percentage positions.

- **4.8 Volume 8 Techniques – Body Lock Entries, Finishes & Transitions**  
  - Body-lock entries from leg attacks: collecting a body lock after failed or partially finished doubles and singles (chasing the hips instead of the legs when they defend), including transitions from thigh control to full torso control.  
  - Direct body-lock entries from ties: underhook-and-collar, double-underhooks, and Russian-tie-to-body-lock sequences that exploit broken stance or overreactions to snapdowns.  
  - Inside-trip and outside-trip finishes: classic inside and outside trips from body locks with emphasis on hip-to-hip and chest-to-chest connection, plus small-step footwork that protects your own base.  
  - Mat-returns and lift finishes: lifting the opponent from a body lock, stepping them away from the hips, and returning them to the mat in ways that land you in strong top control (side control, half guard, or back control) rather than loose scrambles.  
  - Back-exposure transitions: taking the back directly from body locks when opponent turns hard to escape, using knee blocks and hip switches to land in seatbelt and hooks, and linking mat returns to immediate back-take sequences on the ground.

angled head lanes plus inside-hand lanes that let you reach legs and
hips without being tied up.

Notes: single-leg control can lead to classic low finishes, trip-based
finishes, or the specialised “high-leg” branch, which aims to break
stalemates by forcing falls, trips or direct transitions to the back or
body locks.

encourages switching the attack from their legs to their hips and torso,
climbing to body locks that lead to more stable top or back control.

## 6.0 DRILLING PROGRESSIONS

- **6.1 Solo Drills – Stance, Level Changes & Footwork**  
  - Stance and posture drills: shadow rounds where you maintain a weight-bearing stance, chest over base, head carried on forehead/temple line, and elbows in while moving forward, back, laterally and on diagonals.  
  - Level-change repetitions: controlled drops and rises from stance using hip and knee bend only, with hands in a “ready to pummel” position; focus on smoothness, not speed, so you can cycle level changes without losing balance.  
  - Stance-switch drills: switching leads without crossing the feet or letting the chest pitch forward, including “stance switch on command” and “switch as you retreat/advance” patterns.  
  - Angle-step patterns: solo U-steps, L-steps and pivot steps that simulate cutting an angle for doubles, singles and body locks, performed with invisible opponent markers (e.g. cones, tape lines) to build directional awareness.

- **6.2 Solo Drills – Penetration Steps & Floor Contact**  
  - Penetration-step lines: walking the room hitting repeated penetration steps on alternating legs, focusing on knee alignment, toe direction, and trail leg recovery, with a strong upright spine and active head positioning.  
  - Knee-touch control: reps where the knee touches the floor lightly and immediately recovers to stance to prevent bad habits of “staying on the knee” or collapsing under imaginary sprawls.  
  - Sprawl-carry simulations: shadow-wrestling drills where you imagine the opponent’s hips dropping on your shoulders as you step; practise driving your leg and hips through and then recovering to a new, stable base.  
  - Setup-to-shot flows: combine stance-breaking feints, level fakes and penetration steps in one continuous solo pattern – e.g. fake snapdown → reset stance → angle step → penetration shot → stand-up and circle.

- **6.3 Partner Drills – Hand Fighting, Push–Pull & Snapdowns**  
  - Hand-fighting chains: light-intensity rounds where both partners focus on inside ties, wrist control, collar ties and two-on-ones, with a rule that every grip change must either improve head position or move the opponent’s stance.  
  - Push–pull stance reactions: from collar ties and inside ties, practise pushing and pulling to see how far stance can be broken before the partner is forced to re-square; both partners learn to read and exploit overreactions.  
  - Snapdown technical reps: cooperative reps of collar-tie and two-on-one snapdowns where one partner offers a predictable posture and the other practises synchronising level change, step and pull without losing their own base.  
  - Snap-to-front-headlock and snap-to-leg-entry progressions: snapdowns where the follow-up is scripted – either collect a front headlock, angle off and spin, or drop to a specific front-leg entry (knee tap, low single, double) on coach’s call.

- **6.4 Partner Drills – Double-Leg & Single-Leg Entry Chains**  
  - Entry-only doubles: attacker is allowed to penetrate to elbow-deep position on doubles but not to finish; focus is on clean setup, safe head position and immediate conversion to a strong “connection” phase where hips and chest load the legs.  
  - Entry-only singles: from hand-fighting, attacker collects singles (inside or outside) and holds balance while partner maintains realistic but light resistance; drills emphasise the moment of “catch” rather than the finish.  
  - Setup–shot–reset sequences: scripted chains such as snapdown → re-square → outside step angle → double, or two-on-one → drag threat → single; each chain ends with a clean position check and controlled reset, not a scramble.  
  - Double–single–double chains: attacker cycles between double and single entries based on partner’s scripted reactions (e.g. sprawl triggers single, strong whizzer triggers switch back to double or body lock), teaching dynamic decision-making inside the chain.

- **6.5 Partner Drills – Finishes, High Legs & Body Locks**  
  - Double-leg finishing rounds: start from elbow-deep or hands-on-knees position; attacker must finish using cutback, drive, corner or lift options while maintaining posture and aiming to land outside closed guard in a passing-ready position.  
  - Single-leg finishing rounds: start with clean single-leg control; attacker works through run-the-pipe, cutbacks, thigh pry and trip options on coach’s cue, with the defender giving graded resistance but no full scrambles.  
  - High-leg troubleshooting drills: start with the defender hopping on one leg or lifting the leg high; attacker cycles through De Ashi-style trips, turning finishes and transitions to body locks or backside attacks, focusing on resolution rather than endless hopping.  
  - Body-lock integration drills: from mid-chain doubles or singles (deep on the legs but stalled), attacker practises climbing to body locks and finishing with trips or mat returns that lead directly to stable pins or back exposure.

- **6.6 Situational Sparring – Constrained Standing Scenarios**  
  - Hand-fight start rounds: all rounds begin from neutral stance with a rule that the first 15–30 seconds may only involve hand fighting and stance-breaking; no shots allowed until certain positional criteria (e.g. inside ties + head position) are met.  
  - Snapdown-tasks rounds: attacker must attempt a fixed number of snapdowns before being allowed to shoot; this forces integration of the snapdown “jab” into the overall standing game and discourages naked, unprepared shots.  
  - Front-headlock and leg-start rounds: alternate rounds where one partner begins with a front headlock or a deep leg catch (double or single) and both must fight from there; builds comfort in the most common “middle of the chain” positions.  
  - Score/role-based rounds: design rounds where one partner’s job is to secure any controlled takedown within a time limit, while the other’s job is to defend and counter to front headlock or back exposure; later, flip roles so both sides develop offence and defence.  
  - Ruleset-emulation standing rounds: dedicate short blocks to “IBJJF-style” standing (control-focused finishes, conservative risk) and “ADCC-style” standing (more tolerance for scramble entries tied to leg locks and back takes), so athletes can feel how strategy changes while the core mechanics remain the same.


## 7.0 APPLICATION SCENARIOS

- **7.1 Scoring from Takedowns Under Jiu-Jitsu Criteria**  
  - Prioritise takedowns that land you in, or immediately transition to, scoring positions: side control, half guard with strong upper body control, mount or back exposure, rather than “pretty” throws that spill you into scrambles.  
  - Use the four-phase model to plan the finish around the *landing*: when choosing between cutback, run-the-pipe, trip or lift, prefer options that make it easy to clear the legs, avoid tight closed guard and establish chest-to-chest or chest-to-back control.  
  - After completion, treat the first 3–5 seconds as “scoring time”: clamp the hips, control the head/shoulders and stabilise, even if that means delaying immediate submission attempts, since a stable score gives you strategic freedom for the rest of the match.  
  - In training, run “takedown to 5-second control” drills where the round only counts as a success if the takedown flows into stable top control for a coach-defined count.

- **7.2 Dealing with Opponents Who Refuse Takedowns**  
  - Against persistent guard-pullers, use stance-breaking and snapdowns to make them *want* the guard pull: force them into uncomfortable upright stances, drive them to the edge of the mat and create the sense that remaining standing is worse than sitting.  
  - When guard pulls are allowed, treat them as a form of takedown trigger: build sequences where your collar ties, snaps and faked shots encourage predictable guard pulls into the guards you most want to pass (e.g. half guard, seated guard, De La Riva-free positions).  
  - Against opponents who constantly back away and refuse to engage, use small, stance-preserving advances combined with strong head-and-hand presence to cut the mat into smaller segments; do not chase with big entries from long distance that ignore the four-phase model.  
  - In rule sets where stalling calls and out-of-bounds resets exist, understand how your takedown threats interact with those rules: push the pace enough that backing away draws referee pressure, then capitalise when they are forced to stand their ground.

- **7.3 Linking Takedowns to Back Takes & Post-Takedown Control**  
  - Build every main takedown family with explicit “back options”: doubles that turn the corner and run behind, singles that cut back to the far hip, body locks that follow turning escapes into seatbelt, and front headlocks that spin to the back instead of chasing only guillotines.  
  - Prioritise finishes that either:  
    - Land you chest-to-back (backside finishes, inside trips that turn them away, single-leg cutbacks that expose the back), or  
    - Land you chest-to-chest but with an easy line to the back (tight-waist cutback where you immediately climb).  
  - After the opponent falls, avoid the reflex to “settle in place” if their back is already turning; instead, commit to at least one decisive back-chasing step before you accept a static pin. Make the default habit “follow the turn first, then stabilise.”  
  - Integrate mat returns into the system as repeated chances to take the back: any time a standing opponent tries to escape body locks or rear body locks, treat their escape attempt as a back-taking opportunity, not just something to block.

- **7.4 Strategy by Rule Set & Match Duration**  
  - IBJJF-style / points-focused matches:  
    - Place high emphasis on low-risk, control-heavy takedowns that avoid exposing your neck and legs and that drop you into passing positions; doubles, singles and body locks with clear landing patterns are preferred.  
    - Be conservative about speculative long-distance shots, especially early in the match; use stance-breaking and snapdowns to create “easy” entries once the opponent’s stance has degraded.  
    - Once ahead on points, use your standing skills to manage risk: partial entries that force guard pulls, snapdowns that slow the opponent’s pace and threat of takedowns that make them shoot badly.  
  - Submission-only / ADCC-style matches:  
    - Accept a higher degree of scramble as long as the scramble routes are understood and lead to back takes, front headlocks or leg locks; your takedown chains should plug directly into your submission systems.  
    - Use periods where takedowns are rewarded (e.g. ADCC scoring phase) to prioritise higher-value entries like body-locks and well-timed doubles, but avoid all-or-nothing shots that repeatedly give top position away.  
  - Short matches vs long matches:  
    - In short matches, front-loaded aggression with stance-breaking, snapdowns and well-timed doubles can quickly put you ahead; there is less time to recover from early takedown deficits.  
    - In longer matches, emphasise sustainability: stance and level changes that conserve energy, high snapdown volume instead of constant full shots and takedown selection that minimises damage to your own knees and back over time.  
  - Across all formats and durations, the standing system should be chosen to reflect your A-game on the ground: pick takedowns that repeatedly land you in the exact guard-passing, pinning or back-attack configurations you trust most under that rule set.

## 8.0 FOUR-WEEK CURRICULUM

- **8.1 Week 1 – Stance, Hand Fighting & Snapdowns**  
  - Weekly objectives:  
    - Build a reliable, weight-bearing stance with clean motion and level changes.  
    - Develop basic hand-fighting habits that prioritise inside position and safe head placement.  
    - Introduce snapdowns as the primary stance-breaking and setup tool.  
  - Session A – Stance, Motion & Level Changes  
    - Warm-up: stance shadow rounds (forward/backward/sideways/diagonal) maintaining chest over base and elbows in.  
    - Technical: stance variations (same- vs opposite-side), basic footwork, shallow and deep level changes, stance switches without crossing feet.  
    - Drilling: solo penetration-step lines with immediate recovery to stance; partner “stance and motion” games where partner tries to off-balance you with light shoves while you preserve stance.  
    - Positional work: stance-maintenance rounds where partner’s only job is to pull, push and snap lightly while you keep structure and re-establish stance.  
  - Session B – Hand Fighting Fundamentals & Inside Position  
    - Warm-up: wrist pummelling and biceps pummelling in place to emphasise elbows-in posture.  
    - Technical: building collar ties with good elbow position, wrist-control sequences, inside biceps ties, and transitions to underhooks/overhooks without exposing the neck.  
    - Drilling: hand-fighting chains where every exchange must move you towards inside grips or improved head position; partner calls “reset” whenever either person drifts into static 50/50 grips.  
    - Positional work: hand-fighting-only rounds from neutral stance; no shots allowed, scoring based on who secures and maintains dominant head-and-hands positions.  
  - Session C – Snapdowns & First Front-Leg Entries  
    - Warm-up: light collar-tie snaps on a resisting partner, focusing on timing and recovery to stance.  
    - Technical: collar-tie snapdown mechanics, two-on-one snapdowns, snap-to-front-headlock entries and snap-to-front-leg exposure (knee tap or low single).  
    - Drilling: snapdown ladders (e.g. 3 light snaps → 1 strong snap to front headlock → reset), plus snap-to-leg-entry chains with scripted follow-ups.  
    - Positional work: constrained rounds where attacker must create at least one clear stance break (hands towards mat or posture bent) with a snap or push–pull before they are allowed to shoot.

- **8.2 Week 2 – Double-Leg Entries, Variants & Finishes**  
  - Weekly objectives:  
    - Introduce core double-leg mechanics with strong connection and safe head position.  
    - Build a small but robust finishing tree (drive, cutback, corner) tied directly to landing in good ground positions.  
    - Start to link hand fighting and snapdowns to short-range double-leg entries.  
  - Session D – Entry Mechanics & Elbow-Deep Doubles  
    - Warm-up: solo penetration steps and “knee touch and recover” lines, emphasising upright spine and trail-leg recovery.  
    - Technical: standard penetration double (step, knee, trail leg, head and shoulder alignment), elbow-deep positioning, and immediate hip-under adjustments to resist sprawls.  
    - Drilling: entry-only doubles from neutral stance and from collar ties; attacker must achieve elbow-deep control and stable connection, then reset without finishing.  
    - Positional work: starting in elbow-deep double with light resistance; attacker’s job is to maintain connection and avoid being sprawled or front-headlocked, not yet to finish.  
  - Session E – Double-Leg Finishes & Landing Positions  
    - Warm-up: partner “hip drop” simulation where defender leans weight into your shoulders as you hold elbow-deep doubles and adjust hips and feet to carry the load.  
    - Technical: drive finishes, cutback finishes and angle/corner finishes, each demonstrated with preferred ground landing (half guard, headquarters, chest-to-chest, avoiding tight closed guard).  
    - Drilling: 3-phase drills – enter to elbow-deep → connect (hips under, chest to thighs) → finish using coach-called option (drive/cutback/corner).  
    - Positional work: from mid-range stance, defender offers graded resistance; attacker must time entries from stance-breaking or snapdowns and finish to a defined stable top position, with a 3–5 second control count.  
  - Session F – Snapdown-to-Double Chains & Defensive Awareness  
    - Warm-up: snapdown sequences directly followed by penetration steps on coach’s call (snap-only vs snap-to-shot).  
    - Technical: snap-to-double and hand-fight-to-double chains, including quick “abort” mechanics for when the setup is not clean and you need to re-square.  
    - Drilling: alternating reps where one partner sets up doubles from snapdowns while the other partner’s job is to sprawl lightly and pummel to front headlock if the entry is poor, teaching the attacker to respect bad entries.  
    - Positional work: stand-up rounds limited to doubles: attacker may only score with doubles and doubles must start from some form of stance break or inside-tie advantage, not from random dives.

- **8.3 Week 3 – Single-Leg Mechanics, Finishes & High-Leg Options**  
  - Weekly objectives:  
    - Build a clear, limited single-leg finishing tree that you can execute under resistance.  
    - Integrate double-to-single and single-to-double transitions as standard problem-solving patterns.  
    - Introduce high-leg finishes and troubleshooting for common defensive reactions (whizzer, limp-leg, prolonged hopping).  
  - Session G – Single-Leg Entries & Base Finishes  
    - Warm-up: stance and angle footwork drills, emphasising outside steps and pivot steps that naturally expose one leg.  
    - Technical: inside single-leg entries from hand fighting, outside single-leg entries off angle steps, and double-to-single transitions when one leg slips from your double.  
    - Drilling: “catch and hold” single-leg drills where attacker enters, establishes clean head and shoulder position and holds without finishing while defender balances and offers light resistance.  
    - Positional work: starting from solid single-leg control, attacker cycles between run-the-pipe and basic cutback finishes on coach’s call, with defender giving realistic but controlled resistance.  
  - Session H – Expanded Single-Leg Finish Tree & Double Transitions  
    - Warm-up: partner pummelling into single-leg entries followed by immediate reset; focus on recognising when singles are naturally offered by stance and angle.  
    - Technical: thigh-pry finishes, foot-trip variations (inside/outside), tight-waist cutbacks and single-to-double transitions when opponent square-steps or brings the far leg too close.  
    - Drilling: scripted chains such as single → run-the-pipe → if blocked, switch to cutback; or single → opponent squares → switch to double and finish; each chain practised on both sides.  
    - Positional work: short rounds where attacker must score only via singles and single-based chains, no doubles allowed, to force depth of understanding in single-leg mechanics and transitions.  
  - Session I – High-Leg Scenarios & Troubleshooting  
    - Warm-up: high-leg control drills where partner lifts a leg or hops while you practise keeping your head, shoulder and hip positions safe.  
    - Technical: high-leg finishes (De Ashi-style trips, steering them into the “dead angle,” turning finishes into backside positions) plus counters to common defences such as strong whizzers, sprawls and limp-legs.  
    - Drilling: high-leg positional rounds starting with opponent already on one leg; attacker must resolve the position with a finish or controlled body lock within a time constraint.  
    - Positional work: troubleshooting rounds where defender’s job is specifically to whizzer, limp-leg and hop; attacker must chain through high-leg options, single-to-double transitions and body-lock climbs rather than staying stuck in prolonged hopping battles.

- **8.4 Week 4 – Body Locks, System Integration & Standing Sparring**  
  - Weekly objectives:  
    - Integrate body locks as the standing “endgame” that ties together doubles, singles and stance-breaking.  
    - Connect takedowns cleanly to back takes, mat returns and immediate passing sequences.  
    - Pressure-test the standing system with situational and then freer standing sparring that reflects your main rule set.  
  - Session J – Body-Lock Entries from Leg Attacks & Ties  
    - Warm-up: underhook and two-on-one drills that naturally lead into body-lock grips without exposing your own back.  
    - Technical: climbing from doubles and singles to side and rear body locks when legs are defended (chasing hips instead of insisting on legs), plus direct body-lock entries from underhook-and-collar and double-underhook positions.  
    - Drilling: leg-attack-to-body-lock chains where attacker must switch focus from legs to hips when defender sprawls or limp-legs, then finish with inside or outside trips that land in strong chest-to-chest or chest-to-back top positions.  
    - Positional work: starting in body-lock positions (side or rear); attacker must finish with a trip or mat return and immediately establish top or back control with a short control count.  
  - Session K – Back-Take & Mat-Return Integration  
    - Warm-up: mat-return mechanics, lifting and turning drills using bands or light partners to get comfortable with repeated mat returns without fatigue or sloppy posture.  
    - Technical: from body locks and rear body locks, series of mat returns that feed directly into back exposure, seatbelt, hooks and leg-drag style passing; linking takedowns, mat returns and back takes into one continuous chain.  
    - Drilling: “get up / return” rounds where defender’s job is to stand up from bottom or turtle while attacker’s job is to maintain body lock or rear body lock and repeatedly return them to the mat, hunting the back each time.  
    - Positional work: rounds starting from half-finished takedowns (deep single, stalled double, partial body lock) where the attacker is scored on whether they can convert to either clean top control or back takes within a short window.  
  - Session L – Integrated Standing Sparring & Ruleset Emulation  
    - Warm-up: short rounds of hand-fighting and snapdowns to re-activate stance-breaking habits developed over the block.  
    - Technical review: brief review of your personal A-game chains (e.g. snap → front-leg double → cutback → half-guard smash, or two-on-one → single → high-leg finish → body lock → back take).  
    - Standing sparring: progressive rounds starting with strong constraints (e.g. “must snap before shooting,” “must start from underhook vs whizzer”) and gradually relaxing towards full standing sparring with takedowns and immediate ground continuation.  
    - Ruleset-specific rounds: final rounds tailored to your main competition ruleset (IBJJF-style, ADCC-style, local rules), emphasising takedown choices, risk levels and follow-up strategies that best fit that format.  
    - Reflection: quick written or verbal summary after the block – identify which takedown family feels like your natural A-game (doubles, singles, body locks), which positions cause the most problems (e.g. high-leg stalemates, sprawls to front headlock) and which 1–2 themes should shape the next training block.

## Annex A – Extracted Key Passages

### A.1 Rule-Set, Risk Profile and Scoring

- In jiu-jitsu, standing takedowns are structurally high-risk actions: failed attempts can lead directly into submissions, back exposure, or prolonged defensive scrambles with no referee rescue.
- Wrestling and judo let you “hide” in stalemates or turtle while the referee saves you; in jiu-jitsu, there is no such rescue – if you dive on a bad shot or throw and get stuck, you must fight your way out alone.
- Many classic wrestling and judo attacks become dangerous when submissions are legal and there are no shoes: the same throws and leg attacks that score easily in those sports can feed flying armbars, triangles and leg locks in jiu-jitsu.
- Takedown scoring is fundamentally different: putting someone’s backside or even whole body on the mat briefly may score in wrestling or judo, but in jiu-jitsu it often scores nothing unless shoulders or upper body are pinned under control for several seconds.
- Because opponents can post on their hands and immediately stand back up, it is “damn hard” to earn classic takedown points on a resisting opponent under jiu-jitsu rules.
- The majority of real takedown scores in jiu-jitsu come not from the initial impact but from what happens in the three seconds after the opponent hits the mat, most often when they expose their back trying to escape.
- Success from standing is determined less by “who hit the throw” and more by who can tie together takedown attempts with transitions into back exposure and sustained top control under the actual scoring criteria.
- The aftermath of the takedown is at least as important as the takedown itself; in practice, most scoring happens after the opponent’s initial fall, not at the moment of impact.

### A.2 Stance, Preliminaries and Defensive Responsibility

- The standing phase must begin with a stance that can carry the opponent’s weight, defend against shots and still allow forward offence; there is no single globally correct stance, but whatever is used must support those functions.
- There is no universally dominant stance style across high-level grapplers: different elite athletes succeed with more bent European-style stances, more upright North American styles, square or staggered bases; what matters is whether the stance serves takedown and defence goals in jiu-jitsu.
- Takedowns require preliminaries: before attacking the legs, you must first make them easier to take by breaking stance, winning head position, and forcing the opponent to use their hands defensively.
- Standing work begins with becoming “defensively responsible”: using head and hands so that there is always an elbow or hand between the opponent’s head and your legs whenever they attempt to shoot.
- From the first tie-up, hand fighting and push–pull actions must be organised so that you are simultaneously safe from surprise entries and actively degrading the opponent’s stance and posture.

### A.3 Snapdowns and Stance-Breaking as the “Jab”

- The snapdown is the standing equivalent of a jab in striking: a multi-tasking tool that underpins most of the rest of the game.
- Long-term success on the feet is governed by one central factor: the ability to break the opponent’s stance.
- As long as the opponent’s stance remains intact, they will be strong both offensively and defensively; once their stance breaks, both their attacks and defences erode dramatically.
- The ultimate goal of repeated snapdowns is to degrade stance over time until takedowns and back takes become almost inevitable.
- A first function of the snapdown is to make the opponent step: you should be able to “puppet master” the opponent’s feet, bringing whichever leg you want closer, in the stance you want, at the moment you want.
- By snapping to draw a chosen leg forward or to square the stance, you reduce the distance and difficulty of both single-leg and double-leg entries.
- A second function of snapdowns is to bring the opponent’s hands to the mat; once their hands are on the floor, many leg attacks and spin-behind transitions become vastly easier.
- Snapdowns therefore serve three related goals: move feet, bring hands down, and erode stance to the point where entries and finishes become low risk and high percentage.

### A.4 Four-Phase Framework for Front-Leg Tackles

- Almost all front-leg tackles can be understood as passing through four phases: setup, catch, connection, and completion.
- Setup: any action that creates a brief structural or positional advantage – breaking stance, forcing a step, drawing hands to the mat, getting outside the elbows, or opening a clear lane from head to legs.
- Catch: the moment hands first secure one or both legs; this may involve gripping behind the knee, snaking around the calf, going elbow-deep behind the knee, or locking higher up near the hips.
- Connection: moving from the initial catch into a solid structural linkage between your body and the opponent’s – chest, head, hips and grips working together so you can carry their weight without collapsing.
- Completion: the finishing actions that convert that connection into either a knockdown plus control, or an immediate transition to the back or body lock.
- The setup phase is about creating a momentary window; the catch phase is about getting hands to the legs before that window closes; connection is about turning a fragile hold into something that can withstand sprawls; completion is where scoring and control are decided.
- It is normal that the catch phase involves some reaching and extension of the arms, contrary to oversimplified coaching advice that insists elbows must never leave the ribs; the crucial detail is that this extension is brief and followed by a strong connection phase that recovers structure.
- Locked-hand connections just under the buttocks provide the strongest possible attachment for leg tackles; with hands locked there, even a full sprawl can often be carried and converted into a strong attacking position.

### A.5 Head Position, Angular Advantage and Ties

- Head position is not just a safety factor but a scoring tool; moving from neutral forehead-to-forehead into asymmetric forehead-to-collarbone contacts creates angular advantage that translates into entries and takedowns.
- Symmetric ear-to-ear, collar-tie-and-elbow positions where both athletes have the same tie offer no inherent advantage; they often lead to aimless wrestling with little scoring potential.
- The goal is to create head positions where your forehead is on the opponent’s collarbone or neck while theirs is not; from such angles, any push drives across their body toward their legs or back instead of straight into their stance.
- Effective use of small head movements, often only half the width of the forehead, is enough to convert neutral head contact into advantageous angles without large, telegraphed motions.
- Angular advantage from head position should be used immediately to slide toward the legs or back, rather than held as a static tie.

### A.6 Head–Hands Positional Ladder

- The standing hand-fighting game can be understood as constantly cycling through three main stance-breaking goals:
  - Driving the opponent’s hands toward the mat.
  - Winning position outside the opponent’s elbows.
  - Creating clear lanes where there is “nothing between their legs and your head”.
- From initial head–hands contact, the operator must:
  - First make themselves defensively responsible (head and hands blocking direct entries).
  - Then work hands down to the mat, outside the elbows, or straight-line lanes toward the legs.
  - Then progress to dominant positions where one or both legs are lifted or the body is locked from behind.
- Reaching positions where both of the opponent’s legs are controlled in a strong “block double” configuration or where the body is locked from behind represents the top of this ladder: structurally dominant positions from which takedowns and scores are most easily obtained.

### A.7 Connection Mechanics and Gripping Priorities

- When catching legs, grips that use structural hooks on the opponent’s anatomy are preferred: behind the knee tendons, wrapped around the calf, elbow-deep behind the knee, or locked just below the buttocks.
- Behind-the-knee grips that use the tendons as a handle make it difficult for the opponent to simply retract the leg; this is true from both inside and outside entries.
- Snaking the wrists around the calf and locking behind the lower leg is another strong connection, especially when combined on both legs.
- Elbow-deep grips behind the knee create powerful single-leg control where even strong retraction attempts are difficult to execute.
- The best connection for leg tackles is a locked grip high on the back of the thighs, just under the buttocks; with hands locked there, even full sprawls can often be carried while building up into stronger finishing positions.
- Practising the sensation of gripping against a partner who actively tries to pull the leg away builds the real-world feel needed to maintain connection under resistance.

### A.8 Body Locks, Back Takes and Scoring Bias

- Transitions from leg attacks to body locks form one of the highest percentage pathways in submission grappling, particularly given the lack of shoes and the presence of leg-lock threats.
- Controlling a single leg is inherently risky in a rule set where opponents can easily jump into submissions and where lower-leg control is compromised; shifting to waist and chest-to-chest control often provides safer, more stable dominance.
- Working at the waist and chest level has major advantages: easier back takes, easier knockdowns, and much stronger control of scrambles after the opponent hits the mat.
- The back is the most productive scoring and finishing position in jiu-jitsu; two hooks and rear control provide both the largest point awards and the most direct submission routes.
- From a chest-to-chest body lock, if the opponent turns to escape or stand, they almost inevitably expose their back in ways that can be converted into hooks and rear control.
- Because of how takedown points are actually awarded, tying leg attacks into body locks and then into back takes aligns the standing system with the dominant scoring and submission patterns of the sport.

## Annex B – Terminology

### B.1 Global Concepts and Structures

- **Standing phase**  
  The portion of a jiu-jitsu match conducted on the feet before any grounded control is established; includes stance, motion, hand fighting, snapdowns, entries, takedowns and immediate post-takedown control.

- **Risk profile of takedowns**  
  The overall danger associated with shooting or throwing in jiu-jitsu, where submissions, back exposure and lack of referee resets can make failed takedowns far more costly than in wrestling or judo.

- **Preliminaries (standing preliminaries)**  
  All structural and positional work that must be in place before leg attacks: stance, level, distance, head position, hand fighting and stance-breaking actions that create easier entries and safer finishes.

- **Defensive responsibility**  
  A state where stance, head and hand position together prevent clean opponent entries; typically involves an elbow, forearm or hand between the opponent’s head and your legs at all times during their shot attempts.

- **Stance breaking**  
  Any action that degrades the opponent’s base and posture: forcing steps, narrowing or widening stance, bending posture, or driving hands toward the mat so that both offence and defence weaken.

- **Front-leg preference**  
  The strategic emphasis on attacking the leg closest to you (the “front leg”) because it requires shorter entries, is easier to locate and is more exposed once stance is broken.

- **Back-exposure bias**  
  The strategic bias toward takedowns and sequences that expose the opponent’s back during or after the takedown, reflecting the scoring and finishing value of back control in jiu-jitsu.

- **Post-takedown phase**  
  The critical few seconds after the opponent hits the mat, where their attempts to scramble or stand often expose the back or concede control; in practice, this is where most takedown scoring and positional advantage are decided.

- **Chain wrestling (takedown chaining)**  
  Linking multiple attacks and transitions—setups, leg attacks, body locks, back takes—into one continuous offensive flow rather than relying on a single shot to succeed.

- **Four-phase takedown model**  
  A conceptual framework dividing front-leg tackles into four phases: setup, catch, connection and completion; used as the organising principle for all entries and finishes.

### B.2 Stance, Level and Distance

- **Weight-bearing stance**  
  A stance where the legs and hips—not the lower back or neck—carry both your own weight and any additional opponent weight (sprawl, collar-tie pressure), while still enabling offence and defence.

- **Same-side stance**  
  A stance configuration where both athletes lead with the same leg (e.g. right vs right), shaping which leg is “front” and influencing single- and double-leg angles.

- **Opposite-side stance**  
  A stance configuration where one athlete leads right and the other left; changes angles, leg accessibility and the preferred directions for entries and counters.

- **Level change**  
  A controlled lowering of the hips and shoulders to attack legs or threaten shots, driven by hip and knee bend rather than waist flexion; must allow quick recovery back to stance.

- **Distance management**  
  Control of the horizontal separation between athletes so that most work is done in realistic engagement ranges (hand fighting and entry range), not in out-of-range fake-shot distance.

- **Entry distance**  
  The specific distance from which a shot can be launched safely and effectively, after preliminaries have created a window; too far leads to reaching, too close without ties leads to clinch scrambles or throws.

### B.3 Head, Hands and Ties

- **Head position**  
  The relative placement of your head against the opponent’s; includes neutral head-to-head, ear-to-ear, and advantaged positions such as forehead-to-jaw or forehead-to-collarbone on one side.

- **Angular head position**  
  Any head contact that creates an angle—typically forehead into the opponent’s collarbone, jaw or neck on one side—rather than symmetric head-to-head; used to open lanes to legs and back.

- **Head-and-shoulder lane**  
  A clear path from your head and leading shoulder to the opponent’s legs or hips without their arms or head blocking; represents an ideal entry corridor after stance breaking.

- **Inside position (hands and forearms)**  
  A configuration where your hands and forearms are between the opponent’s arms and torso; favours collar ties, underhooks and strong defensive frames against shots.

- **Outside the elbows**  
  A stance-breaking condition where your head and/or shoulders have moved outside the opponent’s elbow line, limiting their ability to block entries and giving you direct lines to hips and legs.

- **Collar tie**  
  A grip controlling the back or side of the opponent’s head/neck with one hand while your forearm runs down their chest and your elbow stays in; forms a hub for snapdowns and front-leg exposure.

- **Inside tie / biceps control**  
  Forearm and hand connection on the inside of the opponent’s arms near the biceps; used both to prevent shots and to upgrade to collar ties, underhooks or two-on-ones.

- **Two-on-one / Russian tie**  
  A control where both of your arms focus on one of the opponent’s arms (usually wrist and elbow), allowing you to steer stance, expose the near or far leg, and threaten back or body-lock entries.

- **Underhook**  
  An arm threaded under the opponent’s arm, usually reaching to their far shoulder or upper back; used for body locks, throws and pressure-based stance breaking.

- **Overhook**  
  An arm wrapping over and around the opponent’s arm, often clamping down on their shoulder; used for snapdowns, throw-bys and defensive control against underhooks and shots.

- **Head-and-hands control**  
  The combined use of head placement and inside hand position to protect legs while creating windows for stance breaking and entries; considered the central control layer of standing grappling.

### B.4 Snapdowns, Front Headlocks and Stance-Breaking Tools

- **Snapdown**  
  A sharp downward pull on the opponent’s head and neck, coordinated with level change and footwork, to break posture, move feet, and drive hands toward the mat; treated as the standing analogue of a jab.

- **Light snapdown**  
  A lower-intensity snap used repeatedly to make the opponent step, adjust stance, and reveal which stance and leg exposures will likely appear under pressure.

- **Hard snapdown**  
  A more explosive snap designed to put the opponent’s hands on the mat or open immediate front headlock or takedown threats.

- **Front headlock (standing)**  
  A control where the opponent’s head and one arm are trapped from the front while they are still on their feet or in a semi-bent posture; central hub for guillotine threats, spins to the back and short-range leg entries.

- **Hands-to-mat condition**  
  A stance-breaking state where the opponent has been forced to post both or one hand on the floor; significantly weakens both their defence and their ability to counterattack.

- **Stance-breaking cycle**  
  The repeated process of using snaps, push–pull, angle steps and grip changes to continually degrade stance rather than holding static ties.

### B.5 Takedown Families and Phases

- **Setup phase**  
  The initial phase of a takedown where stance is broken, head and hands win position, and a structural window appears; no stance break, no valid setup.

- **Catch phase**  
  The moment hands first secure contact on the legs—knees, calves, ankles or thighs—before full body connection is established.

- **Connection phase**  
  The phase where a loose leg catch is converted into strong structural linkage between chest, head, hips, grips and the opponent’s legs/hips; designed to withstand sprawls and directional changes.

- **Completion phase**  
  The finishing phase that converts connection into a takedown plus control or back exposure; includes trips, cutbacks, lifts, runs and mat returns chosen with scoring and safety in mind.

- **Penetration step**  
  The step used to enter under the opponent’s base for doubles and some singles; involves stepping between or beside the opponent’s feet with the lead leg while the trail leg recovers forward.

- **Double-leg tackle**  
  A takedown where both legs are captured, usually by wrapping behind the knees or thighs and driving or cutting angles to bring the opponent to the mat.

- **Single-leg tackle**  
  A takedown where one leg is captured and controlled at or above the knee; can be inside or outside depending on head position and body alignment.

- **Elbow-deep double**  
  A double-leg where one or both arms are buried deep behind the opponent’s knees so that the elbows are tight behind the joint; provides strong resistance to leg retraction.

- **High-leg position**  
  A standing or semi-standing position where one of the opponent’s legs is lifted high, forcing them to hop or balance on one leg; frequent from single-leg sequences.

- **Body lock (standing)**  
  A torso-level grip where both arms encircle the opponent’s body at or above the hips, with hands locked behind their back; used for trips, mat returns and back takes.

- **Side body lock / rear body lock**  
  Variants of the body lock depending on angle: side body lock from lateral chest-to-chest angle; rear body lock from behind the hips or waist.

- **Mat return**  
  Any technique that brings a standing or rising opponent back down to the mat from a rear body lock, waist lock or similar grip; functions as a secondary takedown within the same exchange.

### B.6 Connection Mechanics and Grips

- **Behind-the-knee grip**  
  Hand position where fingers curl into the tendon behind the opponent’s knee; provides a strong hook that resists leg retraction.

- **Calf wrap / lower-leg wrap**  
  A connection where the forearms circle around the lower leg or calf and the hands lock; used to secure legs during low entries and some single-leg variations.

- **Thigh-and-hip lock**  
  A locked-hand grip high on the back of the thighs close to the hips; considered a superior connection for carrying sprawls and driving through finishes.

- **Locked hands**  
  Any configuration where both hands are joined (e.g. palm-to-palm, S-grip, gable grip) behind the legs or body; significantly increases control and power transfer.

- **Hip-under adjustment**  
  The movement where the attacker brings their hips under or very close to the opponent’s hips during a sprawl, rather than staying extended behind; used to recover posture and preserve attacking potential.

### B.7 Failures, Defences and Error States

- **Naked shot**  
  A takedown attempt launched without a real setup, from intact opponent stance, and without prior stance-breaking; generally high risk and low percentage.

- **Overreach**  
  Leaning the upper body toward the opponent for ties or shots without stepping the base under the body; exposes the neck and back to snapdowns and front headlocks.

- **Flat sprawl (against you)**  
  A defensive reaction where the opponent drives hips and legs back into your upper body, attempting to flatten you on the mat and create front headlock or spin-behind opportunities.

- **Front-headlock punishment**  
  The pattern where failed, poorly set-up shots or collar ties are repeatedly countered by snapdowns into front headlocks, teaching the cost of ignoring preliminaries.

- **Stance reset**  
  The act of safely aborting a shot or tie and returning to sound stance and head–hands position rather than forcing bad continuation from a compromised posture.

- **High-leg stalemate**  
  A prolonged single-leg scenario where the attacker and defender both hop with little progress; indicates lack of clear high-leg finishing chains or transitions to body lock/back.

### B.8 Training and Implementation Terms

- **Setup-only drilling**  
  Training rounds where athletes are allowed to create windows (stance breaks, head position wins, hand drops) but are not allowed to shoot, forcing focus on preliminaries.

- **Entry-only drilling**  
  Rounds where athletes enter to catch or connection positions (elbow-deep doubles, singles) and then freeze or lightly continue, prioritising clean entries over finishes.

- **Constraint-based sparring**  
  Standing rounds run under specific rules (e.g. “must snap before shooting”, “no shots from bad head position”) to hard-wire correct sequencing and discourage common errors.

- **Takedown-to-control metric**  
  A tracking measure that counts takedowns as successful only when followed by several seconds of stable top control or back exposure, reflecting real scoring rather than simple knockdowns.

## Annex C – Additional Notes

### C.1 System Architecture

- The standing system is explicitly built around a four-phase takedown model (setup → catch → connection → completion), with all leg attacks and body-lock entries evaluated against these phases rather than as isolated moves.
- Stance and preliminaries are treated as a separate structural layer that must be solved before entries: defensive responsibility, head–hands control and stance-breaking are prerequisites, not optional “nice to haves”.
- Snapdowns, head position battles and hand fighting form the central “control ring” of the system: most exchanges cycle through this ring repeatedly before a legitimate opportunity to attack the legs or body appears.
- The system is biased toward front-leg tackles and subsequent transitions to body locks and back exposure, reflecting the realities of jiu-jitsu scoring and the risk of leg-based submissions.
- Double-leg tackles are framed as the primary leg-attack family from structurally strong setups; single legs, high-leg positions and body locks are layered as complementary branches rather than independent silos.
- Body locks are positioned as a high-value convergence point: many sequences are designed so that failed or partially successful leg attacks climb into torso control, which in turn connects directly to trips, mat returns and back takes.
- The standing system is not independent from ground strategy; it is designed so that finishing choices and landing directions funnel into preferred top games (passing systems, ride positions, back-attack platforms) instead of random guards.

### C.2 Progression Logic and Phase Emphasis

- The progression moves from low-risk, high-structure skills (stance, level change, head–hands control) into higher-risk actions (leg entries and throws) only after the preliminaries are robust.
- Within entries, the system progresses from short-range, tie-based doubles and singles—where stance is already compromised—into more demanding distance shots; this is the reverse of many wrestling programmes that begin with long-distance entries.
- The four phases are not given equal weight; setup and connection are repeatedly emphasised as the phases that determine whether an exchange is structurally safe, while catch and completion are treated as transient moments influenced by those foundations.
- The technical progression for doubles and singles is always framed by the four-phase lens: each new detail is associated with a phase (e.g. a grip detail belongs to catch/connection, a footwork pattern belongs to setup/connection, a finish belongs to completion).
- There is a deliberate emphasis on learning how to abort or reset during the early phases; bailing from bad setups or poor catches back to stance is considered a core skill, not a failure.
- Later-stage work focuses increasingly on transitions between families—double to single, single to body lock, body lock to back—so that the athlete experiences the system as a network of pathways rather than a list of techniques.

### C.3 Relationship to Ground Game and Scoring

- Takedown choice is explicitly tied to what positions will likely follow on the ground: finishes that throw both athletes into neutral guard scrambles are deprioritised in favour of those that land directly in half guard, side control, headquarters or back exposure.
- Particular value is placed on finishes and mat returns that drop the opponent into positions where their immediate escape attempts expose the back or create easy transitions into seated back attacks.
- The system assumes that many “successful” takedowns in traditional sense will not generate meaningful advantage in jiu-jitsu; therefore, the evaluation metric becomes “takedown to stable top or back” rather than “takedown to mat”.
- Standing sequences are designed with the expectation that the opponent will attempt to stand up quickly; repeated mat return and back-chasing options are therefore built into the completion phase rather than added later as separate techniques.
- Specific structural choices (e.g. preference for doubles that land outside tight closed guard, preference for body locks over extended single-leg struggles) are rationalised in terms of submission risk and guard entanglement avoidance.
- The system’s heavy back-exposure bias ensures that standing work supports the most rewarded and most decisive position in jiu-jitsu, rather than distributing effort evenly across all possible outcomes.

### C.4 Study and Training Strategy

- Technical learning is to be anchored by the four-phase model; when studying any new entry or finish, the first question is “which phase does this live in and what does it fix or improve?” rather than “how do I do this move?”.
- Early study phases should focus on stance, head–hands control and snapdowns until athletes can reliably maintain defensive responsibility while still degrading stance; premature focus on shot mechanics without this base is discouraged.
- Drilling is expected to be heavily constrained and phase-specific: setup-only rounds, entry-only rounds, connection-holding rounds and finish-only rounds, each with clear success/failure conditions.
- The system encourages splitting drilling into “clean environment” and “noisy environment”: first build correct mechanics cooperatively, then add realistic resistance while keeping constraints (e.g. must snap before shooting, must finish to half/side/back).
- Video or memory review after sparring is framed around the four phases: identify whether failures occurred at setup (no stance break), catch (no reliable grip), connection (flattened by sprawl) or completion (landed in poor guard/neutral).
- Study order across the wider game is suggested implicitly: standing system → takedown-to-top system → passing or ride system → back-attack or submission chains, so that each new instructional plugs into an existing structural backbone.

### C.5 Coaching Emphases, Habits and Traps

- A central coaching emphasis is to treat snapdowns, head position battles and basic hand fighting as ongoing primary tasks, not as a brief prelude before “the real wrestling” begins.
- There is repeated insistence that athletes avoid long periods of symmetric ties and static collar-tie pummelling; any prolonged symmetry is seen as a sign that stance-breaking and head-position work have stalled.
- Coaches are encouraged to actively punish naked shots, overreaches and lazy collar ties with snapdowns, front headlocks and spins, to make structural errors feel immediately costly.
- Athletes are warned against over-identifying with particular takedown names or styles; instead, they are asked to think in terms of “solve setup, then solve connection, then pick the least risky completion that leads to my best ground game”.
- A major trap highlighted is treating standing as either a token warm-up or a separate sport; the system is explicit that standing skills must be integrated into the overall jiu-jitsu game plan and trained with the same seriousness as guard and passing.
- Another trap is emotional: athletes often interpret failed shots as personal failure and either stop attacking or start attacking wildly; the system reframes this by grading success on process metrics (correct phase behaviour, good bails) rather than just finished takedowns.
- Coaches are encouraged to keep the tactical conversation grounded in rule set and match duration (points vs sub-only, short vs long matches), so that entry selection, risk level and use of body locks or leg attacks always reflect the actual environment the athlete will compete in.

## Annex E – Common Failure Patterns

### E.1 Bending at the Waist Instead of Level Changing

- Failure description  
  Athlete “dives” forward for ties or shots by folding at the waist, with hips high and head dropping toward the floor while the legs stay relatively straight; entries look like a bowing motion rather than a controlled drop under the opponent.

- Underlying cause  
  Misunderstanding of level change (treated as upper-body movement instead of hip and knee flexion) and anxiety about closing distance, leading to reaching with the head and shoulders rather than stepping the base under the body.

- Corrective strategies  
  Emphasise knee-and-hip-only level-change drills in shadow wrestling; use a simple rule in drilling that any time hips rise above shoulder line or spine folds sharply, the partner immediately snaps to front headlock; run “touch-and-go” penetration-step lines where the knee barely kisses the mat and immediately recovers, reinforcing vertical drop and recovery instead of forward collapse.


### E.2 Shooting Without a Real Setup (“Naked Shots”)

- Failure description  
  Athlete launches doubles or singles from intact opponent stance, without prior stance break, head-position win or meaningful hand fight; shots appear from long distance with no visible reason why the opponent should be compromised.

- Underlying cause  
  Treating shots as independent techniques rather than the fourth step in a process; over-focusing on penetration mechanics while ignoring stance-breaking, head–hands control and the requirement to use snapdowns as a “jab”.

- Corrective strategies  
  Enforce “no setup, no shot” constraints in sparring where any takedown attempt must be preceded by a clearly recognisable stance break or head-position win; drill setup-only rounds where shots are forbidden and the sole task is to move feet, drop hands and create head-and-shoulder lanes; score attempts in training based on whether setup criteria were met, not just whether someone briefly hits the mat.


### E.3 Reaching with Hands Before Moving Feet

- Failure description  
  Athlete leans rigidly into collar ties, underhooks or leg grabs while feet stay behind, so the body stretches long over the front knee and the head drifts over the toes; ties are fragile and easily snapped or dragged.

- Underlying cause  
  Fear of closing distance with the legs, reliance on upper body to cover ground and poor awareness of where the base needs to be before making contact; often reinforced by drilling from fixed starting grips instead of from motion.

- Corrective strategies  
  Introduce “feet first, hands second” rules where any grip attempted from out of range is punished by immediate snapdown or drag; use stance-and-motion games where partner lightly shoves and snaps any time the head passes beyond the lead knee; teach specific footwork patterns (small entries, angle steps) tied directly to each tie so that every collar tie, two-on-one or underhook is preceded by a step that brings the base under the shoulders.


### E.4 Staying on the Knee After a Shot

- Failure description  
  Athlete drops to one knee for a penetration step and then remains “parked” on that knee while trying to drive or finish; the trailing leg never recovers to a strong base and the torso remains extended underneath the opponent.

- Underlying cause  
  Overemphasis on kneeling entries in drilling, underemphasis on recovery to stance and fear of re-engaging hips once contact is made; misunderstanding that the knee touch is a transient event, not a destination.

- Corrective strategies  
  Use penetration-step lines where any pause on the knee triggers an automatic reset; drill “knee touch and recover” against a partner who is instructed to sprawl lightly if the attacker fails to bring the trail leg up promptly; run situational rounds starting from mid-shot where the only scoring metric is whether the attacker can bring both feet under them and restore posture before attempting to finish.


### E.5 Weak Connection – Trying to Finish Before You Can Carry Weight

- Failure description  
  Athlete catches the legs but immediately attempts to drive, lift or trip while chest, head and hips remain far from the opponent’s hips; legs are held mostly with the arms and any sprawl or twist breaks the grip.

- Underlying cause  
  Rushing to completion and treating “touching the legs” as equivalent to controlling them; lack of respect for the connection phase and inadequate experience carrying a partner’s weight in drilling.

- Corrective strategies  
  Implement connection-holding drills where the attacker must maintain leg control under deliberate sprawl pressure for several seconds before any finish is allowed; cue athletes to “glue chest, head and hips to the legs before trying to move them”; prevent progression to new finishes until the athlete can demonstrate solid connection with locked hands under the buttocks against a partner actively trying to pull the legs free.


### E.6 Finishing Directly into Bad Guards

- Failure description  
  Athlete finishes doubles or singles in ways that drop them straight into tight closed guard, deep half or entangling guards, when a small angle or different finish would have landed in half guard, side control or headquarters.

- Underlying cause  
  Evaluating takedowns by the fact of the fall rather than by the landing; copying wrestling finishes without adjusting for submission and guard threats; lack of explicit “landing targets” in training.

- Corrective strategies  
  In drilling, score takedowns on landing quality, not impact—only finishes that land in pre-agreed “good” positions (half, side, strong headquarters, chest-to-back) count; pair each primary finish with a default angle or direction cue (“cutback to the outside and clear the legs before settling”, “drive diagonally, not straight into their closed guard line”); run specific sequences where the partner is instructed to immediately pull to guard if landing is poor, making the cost visible.


### E.7 Clinging to Legs When the Back Is Exposed

- Failure description  
  As the opponent turns hard during defence, their back begins to open, yet the attacker remains fixated on the legs, continuing to squeeze and chase grips instead of climbing to body lock or back control.

- Underlying cause  
  Techniquedriven mindset where success is defined as “finishing the takedown I started”, combined with lack of a clear hierarchy that places back exposure above leg control.

- Corrective strategies  
  Establish a back-priority rule in designated drills where any clear back exposure forces the attacker to abandon legs and seek seatbelt or body lock; design situational rounds specifically around “legs to back” transitions where the initial goal is leg control but successful scoring is defined as securing hooks or a strong ride; verbally reinforce that leg control is a means to an end and that the back is the top of the positional ladder.


### E.8 Over-Wrestling – Winning the Throw, Losing the Match

- Failure description  
  Athlete chases big throws or explosive shots that look impressive but land them in neutral or disadvantageous ground positions, spending energy for little scoring or submission benefit.

- Underlying cause  
  Importing pure wrestling or judo criteria into jiu-jitsu, where momentary knockdowns are overvalued and the importance of post-takedown control and submission exposure is underweighted.

- Corrective strategies  
  Reframe success metrics in training so that only sequences that end in stable top or back positions are praised; use scenario rounds where throws or takedowns without follow-up control are deliberately scored low or ignored; connect every standing attack to a named ground chain (e.g. “double to half-guard smash to cross-face ride”) so that athletes think in terms of sequences rather than isolated impact moments.


### E.9 Underusing Snapdowns and Stance-Breaking

- Failure description  
  Athlete engages in extended collar-tie pummelling or hand fighting where stance and posture remain essentially unchanged; they rarely snap the head, move the feet or drive hands toward the mat before shooting.

- Underlying cause  
  Viewing snapdowns as occasional big moves instead of continuous low-level tools; comfort with static ties and lack of clear goals for what hand fighting is supposed to achieve.

- Corrective strategies  
  Introduce snap-count targets in rounds (e.g. minimum number of meaningful snaps per minute); run “snap-before-shot” constraints where a takedown attempt is not allowed until a genuine stance break via snap or push–pull has occurred; coach athletes to treat hand fighting as a structured process with explicit goals—move feet, drop hands, win head position—rather than as shapeless grip play.


### E.10 High-Leg Stalemates

- Failure description  
  Single-leg exchanges frequently stall in extended high-leg positions where attacker and defender hop without progress; attacker runs out of ideas and either drops the leg or collapses to guard.

- Underlying cause  
  Incomplete single-leg curriculum that focuses on initial catch but not on high-leg finishing chains; reluctance to transition from leg focus to trips, turns or body locks once the leg is lifted.

- Corrective strategies  
  Build a specific high-leg tree (e.g. “if they hop inward, inside trip; if they hop outward, outside trip; if they drive weight over you, climb to body lock”); run positional rounds beginning already in high-leg with clear time limits and scoring criteria, forcing resolution rather than endless hopping; emphasise head and shoulder positioning under the thigh and lateral movement to make the defender step into trips rather than chasing them in place.


### E.11 Ignoring Defensive Responsibility During Your Own Attacks

- Failure description  
  While focusing on offence, athlete lets their own head drift down and hands leave their defensive posts, leaving themselves open to counters, front headlocks or immediate back takes when the shot fails.

- Underlying cause  
  Viewing defence and offence as separate phases instead of linked states; overcommitting mentally to “this shot must work” and neglecting exit paths and posture.

- Corrective strategies  
  Train explicit bailout patterns from failed shots, emphasising head-position recovery and re-establishing an elbow or forearm between opponent’s head and your legs before disengaging; run rounds where the defender’s primary job is to counterattack aggressively after broken shots, making poor defensive responsibility feel immediately dangerous; repeatedly cue that every phase of attack must be compatible with an immediate defensive reset if the position degrades.


### E.12 Treating Standing as a Warm-Up, Not a System

- Failure description  
  Standing exchanges are short, unstructured and mostly used to get to the ground; there is no clear A-game from the feet, no tracking of progress and no integration between takedowns and ground systems.

- Underlying cause  
  Cultural bias toward guard play and ground grappling, combined with the belief that serious standing training belongs only to wrestling or judo; lack of structural framework for making standing feel as systematic as guard or passing.

- Corrective strategies  
  Protect dedicated standing blocks in training with clearly defined technical themes and measurable goals; use the same level of system thinking—phases, hubs, chains—that is applied to guard and passing; log takedown attempts, good setups, solid connections and quality landings per week, and review them the same way sweeps and passes are reviewed; select one or two standing A-game chains and commit to developing them with the same seriousness as a primary guard or passing system.
