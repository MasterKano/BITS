# VIEWING NOTES – Standing to Ground 1: Takedowns and Standing Skills

## 2.0 Volume 2 — Preliminaries and Hand Fighting

### 2.1 Risk Profile of Takedowns in Jiu-Jitsu

- Key concepts
  - Takedowns in no-gi jiu-jitsu are structurally high risk: failed shots expose the back, neck, and arms with no referee reset to save you.
  - Unlike wrestling, there is no protection for exposing your back during throws and no quick stand-ups if you get stuck under sprawls.
  - The system’s answer is to invest heavily in “preliminaries”: stance, distance, head position, and hand fighting that make actual shots lower risk and higher percentage.

- Position / structure
  - Base stance must tolerate opponent weight without the chest drifting far in front of the base of support.
  - Defensive shell: elbows in, hands and head forming a barrier between your hips and their shoulder line.
  - Preliminaries aim to degrade their stance before you commit to any leg tackle.

- Key cues
  - “Takedowns are expensive; preliminaries are insurance.”
  - “Don’t shoot into a fortress; break the walls first.”
  - “No blind shots from neutral distance.”

- Drills & games
  - Scenario rounds: only hand fighting and stance breaks, no shots allowed; score on clear stance breaks or forced steps.
  - Constraint rounds: attacker must execute a prescribed preliminary (e.g., head position win or snap reaction) before any shot is permitted.

### 2.2 Head Position and Stance Reading

- Key concepts
  - First read is the relationship of shoulder to lead knee: shoulder over knee = shot threat; shoulder behind knee = reduced leg-tackle threat.
  - Defensive soundness = forehead-to-forehead; offensive angle = forehead to temple/collarbone, not ear-to-ear.
  - Head is the primary “shield” that lets you reach with hands without gifting easy entries.

- Position / structure
  - From distance, match head level to opponent when their shoulder is over the lead knee; approach with short arms and head first.
  - Forehead-to-forehead for neutral safety; forehead to side of neck/collarbone for dominant attacking angle.
  - Avoid symmetric ear-to-ear ties; they offer no real structural advantage.

- Key cues
  - “Read shoulder vs knee before you touch.”
  - “Head first, then hands.”
  - “Defence: forehead-to-forehead. Offence: forehead-to-collarbone.”
  - “Angle beats horsepower.”

- Drills & games
  - Stance-reading drill: partner cycles between upright / shoulder-over-knee; player must call and adjust head position before contact.
  - Head-position jousting: start forehead-to-forehead; game is to upgrade to forehead-to-collarbone and hold for a count while partner tries to recover.

### 2.3 Indirect Gripping and Grip Acquisition

- Key concepts
  - Direct grips (just reaching for the collar, wrist, or head) stop working once opponents have basic defence.
  - Higher-level gripping is indirect: fake for one grip or target to draw a predictable reaction, then take what you actually wanted.
  - Indirect gripping hides intent and exploits automatic defensive reactions (down-blocks, wrist pulls, head withdrawals).

- Position / structure
  - Maintain elbow-hip integrity while reaching: initial reach is small and protected, followed by angle or level change.
  - Common pattern: threaten legs to get hands down (for wrist/head), or threaten one wrist to capture the other.

- Key cues
  - “Fake where you don’t care, take where you do.”
  - “Sell the wrong story.”
  - “Good people won’t let you grip them directly.”

- Drills & games
  - Scripted chains: fake far wrist → catch near wrist; fake leg grab → catch wrist or collar; opponent must give realistic reactions.
  - Reaction coding: coach calls “want wrist” or “want collar”; player must choose an appropriate indirect route against a resisting partner.

- System tags
  - Hand fighting – gripping
  - Indirect entries
  - Set-up chains


### 2.4 Inside vs Outside Control

- Key concepts
  - Distinguish inside position (hands inside but no control) from inside control (wrists and elbows inside with structured contact).
  - Inside control tends to expose the centre line (legs and torso); outside control tends to expose the back and outside angles.
  - Thumbs-in inside control specialises in pushing and centre-line exposure; thumbs-out or overhand grips specialise in pulling and back exposure.

- Position / structure
  - Inside control: wrists and elbows inside opponent’s; thumbs can post inside biceps, elbows, or armpit to block level change and shots.
  - Outside control: your wrists outside their elbows; used to drag arms across, create angle, and expose back/hips.
  - Thumb-in = push framework; thumb-over/no-thumb = pull framework.

- Key cues
  - “Inside control exposes centre; outside control exposes back.”
  - “Thumbs in to push, thumbs off to pull.”
  - “Inside wrists, inside elbows, inside thumbs – you own the lane.”

- Drills & games
  - Pommel game: transition between inside and outside control with live resistance, scoring for clean exposures (centre line or back).
  - Thumb-switch drill: partner gives static inside tie; player alternates thumb-in pushing sequences with thumb-off pulling sequences into simple attacks.

- System tags
  - Inside control
  - Arm-drag / back-exposure game
  - Centre-line access


### 2.5 Grip–Contract–Move and the Elbow–Hip Law

- Key concepts
  - Standing hand fighting should follow a simple pattern: get a grip, contract elbows back to torso, then move with your legs.
  - Extended elbows create long levers that are weak and easily manipulated; short elbows are strong and form a defensive wall.
  - Who is really “winning” the tie is determined more by elbow–hip distance than by whose hand is on whose wrist.

- Position / structure
  - Optimal structure: elbows close to hips, hands connected to the opponent; legs and hips do most of the work.
  - Poor structure: arms extended, chest past knees, neck extended, weight borne on back of head/upper back.
  - Even if opponent grips your wrists, if your elbows are tight and theirs are extended, you effectively control the exchange.

- Key cues
  - “Grip, contract, move – in that order.”
  - “Short elbows, strong body; long elbows, weak body.”
  - “Forget who’s gripping; look at elbow–hip distance.”
  - “Don’t wrestle with your arms; wrestle with your legs.”

- Drills & games
  - Pattern drill: from neutral tie, partner calls “grip”; player must immediately contract and start pivot walking, never leaving elbows extended.
  - Elbow–hip audit: freeze frames during live rounds where coach randomly calls “stop” and both athletes check elbow distance to hips and re-set if extended.

- System tags
  - Hand fighting mechanics
  - Structural integrity – elbow/hip
  - Leg-driven wrestling


### 2.6 Push–Pull Integration and Thumb Rules

- Key concepts
  - Pushing and pulling are not done with arm strength alone; arms and head are connectors, legs are the engine.
  - Pushing is built around thumbs and forearms plus head position; pulling is built around hands without thumbs and contracted elbows.
  - Overusing “pure hand pushes” invites arm snaps and level changes; safe pushing must integrate the forehead and inside frames.

- Position / structure
  - Push mode: thumbs posted inside (bicep, elbow, armpit), forearms and head driving with staggered stance and good base.
  - Pull mode: hands cupping (no thumbs), elbows glued to torso, torso and legs walking to generate motion.
  - Head-led pushing angle (forehead to side of neck/collarbone) amplifies your push and opens lines to legs/back.

- Key cues
  - “Push with thumbs, forearms, and head; pull with hands and elbows.”
  - “Thumbs in to lengthen their arm; thumbs off to shorten yours.”
  - “Let the legs move them; arms just connect.”

- Drills & games
  - Push–pull ladder: players alternate 3-count push sequences (thumbs in, head engaged) and 3-count pull sequences (thumbs off, elbows tight) while partner resists.
  - Head-and-hands pushing game: score only when you gain pushing angle (forehead to collarbone) without extending arms.

- System tags
  - Push–pull standing system
  - Thumb-post framework
  - Angle creation (head + hands)


### 2.7 Asymmetrical Grips and the Reset Principle

- Key concepts
  - Symmetrical grips (both have the same collar/elbow etc.) are largely neutral and hard to convert into consistent advantage on equally skilled opponents.
  - Aim for asymmetry: you control an important structure (head, wrist, shoulder girdle) while they do not control the equivalent on you.
  - When you are clearly losing the hand fight (they move you at will, dominate inside space), you should reset by snapping their grips off rather than accept a losing position.

- Position / structure
  - Ideal: you have two hands on them, they have none on you (e.g., head-and-elbow or 2-on-1), or you have their head while your own head is free.
  - Acceptable: you have a high-value control (head, wrist, underhook) and they have only a low-value grip.
  - Reset posture: bring hands back to wrists/forearms, elbows tight, snap grips off using the blade of the hand and step out to space.

- Key cues
  - “Avoid mirror grips.”
  - “Best case: two hands on him, none on you.”
  - “If he’s steering you, you’re losing – snap off and reset.”
  - “Break one hand when possible; both hands when necessary.”

- Drills & games
  - Asymmetry game: start from equal collar–elbow; score only when you achieve a defined asymmetry (e.g., you have head, they don’t; you have 2-on-1, they have nothing).
  - Reset drill: partner builds dominant inside control; defender must clear one or both grips efficiently and re-establish head and elbow–hip integrity.

- System tags
  - Grip asymmetry
  - 2-on-1 / head control funnels
  - Defensive resets


### 2.8 Three Hand-Fighting Goals and Standing Positional Hierarchy

- Key concepts
  - Hand fighting must have clear goals: (1) put opponent’s hands on the mat, (2) get outside their elbows, (3) create an uninterrupted line from your head to their legs.
  - These three goals are interlinked: attempts at one often provoke reactions that give access to the others.
  - There is a hierarchy of dominant standing positions that all these goals are trying to feed: rear body lock, locked double, and progressively higher single legs.

- Position / structure
  - Goal 1 – Hands to mat: head snaps and front headlocks that put hands on the floor or at least to front headlock height.
  - Goal 2 – Outside elbows: arm drags, elbow posts, and 2-on-1s that put your head outside their elbow line and expose legs/back.
  - Goal 3 – Clear line to legs: level changes and fakes that remove head, hands, and elbows from between your head and their hips.
  - Dominant positions:
    - Standing rear body lock (top of hierarchy).
    - Locked double (hands locked behind hips at butt–hamstring junction).
    - Single leg with cross-hip, then cross-armpit, then high on the collarbone.

- Key cues
  - “Three directions: hands to mat, outside elbows, clear line to legs.”
  - “Snap, drag, or duck – everything chases those three.”
  - “Fight towards dominance: back, locked double, high single.”
  - “Neutral is hard work; dominance is where you score.”

- Drills & games
  - Three-goal sparring: rounds where the only scoring events are (a) hands clearly to mat, (b) clean outside elbow angle, or (c) head-to-hip line with no frames; follow-on takedowns are “bonus” but not required.
  - Positional chain drill: start from each dominant position (rear body lock, locked double, cross-hip single, high single) and practise converting to stable takedown finishes.

- System tags
  - Hand-fight objectives
  - Standing positional hierarchy
  - Rear-body-lock system
  - Double/single leg integration


### 2.9 Integrated Standing Blueprint

- Key concepts
  - The standing system is a loop: stance and vision → safe head position → indirect gripping → inside/outside control → push–pull and grip–contract–move → pursue the three goals → enter dominant positions → finish takedowns.
  - Structural principles (elbow–hip integrity, head position, leg-driven movement) are constant, regardless of specific grips or attacks.
  - Hand fighting should constantly aim to degrade stance and funnel into defined dominant positions rather than remain in endless neutral jousting.

- Position / structure
  - Default engagement: matched stance, head level aligned, elbows tight, hands short, reading shoulder–knee relationship.
  - From engagement: upgrade head position, win key grips via indirect methods, maintain elbow–hip integrity, and move with legs rather than arms.
  - Once a goal (hands to mat / outside elbow / clear line) appears, immediately convert it into a leg attack that aims to land in a dominant finishing structure (rear body lock, locked double, or high single variants).

- Key cues
  - “Preliminaries first, shots second.”
  - “Structure before speed.”
  - “Every hand fight must chase a goal and a position.”
  - “If you’re just slapping heads, you’re off-script.”

- Drills & games
  - Blueprint flow drill: scripted rounds where players must verbally call the phase they are in (stance, head, grip, goal, dominance, finish) as they move, to reinforce sequencing.
  - Constraint sparring: rounds limited to “preliminaries and entries only” (no full finishes) to overdevelop the early phases without the distraction of scoring.

- System tags
  - Standing meta-system
  - Preliminaries-to-finish pipeline
  - Structural principles (head / elbow–hip / legs)
