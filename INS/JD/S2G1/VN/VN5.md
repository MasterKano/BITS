## 5.0 Volume 5 — Elbow-Deep Double & Single-Leg Mechanics

### 5.1 Elbow Deep Double Leg – Georges St-Pierre: Mechanics

- Key concepts  
  - GSP-style elbow-deep double completely inverts the usual double-leg mechanic: instead of lifting and driving across, you apply downward, corkscrewing pressure into the mat.  
  - Classic doubles drive up and across with the head wedged between shoulder and arm; GSP’s version drops weight down through the opponent’s knees while circling, so they are corkscrewed to the floor.  
  - Elbow-deep positioning on one leg and strong control on the other leg glues the knees together and makes it extremely hard for opponents to hop or sprawl.

- Position / structure  
  - Start from opposite stance, head inside and shoulder close to the hip line.  
  - Catch position: one arm elbow-deep behind the front knee, the other arm wrapping the far leg; hands connect behind both knees, not low at the ankles.  
  - Head stays tight to the ribs or hip, spine relatively upright; the shoulder line is angled, not square into their hips, so you can walk around the corner.  
  - The central structural feature is the elbow wedged deep behind the knee, locking that leg in place while the other arm prevents hopping.

- Key cues  
  - “Elbow deep and both legs glued together.”  
  - “Downward corkscrew, not up-and-across lift.”  
  - “Head tight, shoulder tight, walk him into the floor.”

- Drills & games  
  - Catch-position reps: start from staged entries and repeatedly build the elbow-deep double catch (elbow behind knee, second arm wrapping far leg, head in tight).  
  - Downward vs upward drive comparison: partners provide the same resistance while you alternate classic lift-and-drive doubles with GSP-style downward corkscrew to feel control and safety differences.

### 5.2 Setups for the Elbow Deep Double

- Key concepts  
  - GSP-style elbow-deep doubles work best when the opponent’s stance is already broken and their legs are close together; you do not want to hunt this from completely neutral distance.  
  - Primary setup tools are snapdowns, hand fighting and stance manipulation that square their feet and bring the front leg closer.  
  - The entry is a short-level change and step into the leg rather than a huge penetration step from far away.

- Position / structure  
  - Work from opposite stance with active head-and-hands hand fighting until you can draw their front leg into range via snaps and push–pull.  
  - As their feet square or step in, you take a short step outside their lead foot and drop your level so your shoulder line sits next to their thigh.  
  - Hands shoot to the knees in one movement, immediately climbing to elbow-deep catch on the near leg and wrapping the far leg.

- Key cues  
  - “Break stance first, then go elbow deep.”  
  - “Short step, short level change, big catch.”  
  - “Square his feet, then take the front knee away.”

- Drills & games  
  - Snap-to-catch drill: series of light snaps and stance-breaking actions, with the rule that you may only shoot the elbow-deep double once both feet are squared or the front leg has clearly stepped in.  
  - Opposite-stance entry rounds: start every exchange in opposite stance and track how often you can turn stance breaks into elbow-deep catches rather than naked shots.

  - standup/stance-break-to-shot  
  - standup/opposite-stance-entries


### 5.3 Corkscrew Finish

- Key concepts  
  - Corkscrew is the primary elbow-deep double finish: instead of driving straight through, you spiral around the legs so their feet are forced together and they are twisted to the mat.  
  - You clear the arm that blocks your entry, glue your shoulder to the thighs and walk tight circles, using short, choppy steps.  
  - Because you control both legs and the elbow is deep, opponent cannot meaningfully hop or sprawl; they are rotated down rather than lifted.

- Position / structure  
  - From elbow-deep catch, you first clear the inside arm that could frame or underhook, then re-clamp with your head and shoulder tight.  
  - Your outside leg (unweighted leg) steps outward and slightly back, starting the circular motion around their legs.  
  - Hands stay high behind the knees, elbows tight, head and chest pressing into the thighs while your feet take quick, small steps to “walk” them down.

- Key cues  
  - “Clear the arm, then walk the corkscrew.”  
  - “Short, choppy steps, not a big lunge.”  
  - “Rotate the knees together and into the mat.”

- Drills & games  
  - Corkscrew-only finish drill: start from elbow-deep catch and finish solely with corkscrew; partner tries to hop or sprawl while you keep steps short and structure tight.  
  - Directional-awareness drill: practise corkscrew steps in both directions and identify which direction aligns better with your stance and head position.

  - standup/corkscrew-double  
  - standup/leg-rotation-finishes  
  - standup/finish-under-control


### 5.4 Flare Across Finish

- Key concepts  
  - Flare-across finish uses the elbow-deep double to drive the opponent diagonally across your body line rather than straight down.  
  - Instead of corkscrewing around, you flare their knees across, collapsing their base sideways and landing in strong passing positions.  
  - Ideal when corkscrew is blocked or when you want to ensure you do not land in tight closed guard.

- Position / structure  
  - From elbow-deep catch, you step to the side and slightly back while lifting and flaring their knees across your body, like opening a gate.  
  - Your head and shoulder drive across their hip line, not straight forward; hips stay under you and knees may drop briefly to the mat to help redirect force.  
  - You finish with chest over their thighs and your body already angled for immediate passing.

- Key cues  
  - “Flare the knees across your belt line.”  
  - “Cut the angle, don’t run straight into guard.”  
  - “Turn them onto their side as they fall.”

- Drills & games  
  - Flares vs corkscrews: from catch, partner gives a cue indicating which direction is blocked; you must switch between flare-across and corkscrew finishes accordingly.  
  - Landing-position drill: flare finishes must land directly into half guard or headquarters; any landing in tight closed guard is scored as a technical error.

  - standup/flare-double  
  - standup/angle-based-finishes  
  - standup/takedown-to-passing


### 5.5 Ear to Back Finish

- Key concepts  
  - Ear-to-back finish is the elbow-deep double’s “go behind” option when legs are slipping away or sprawl beats the direct takedown.  
  - Rather than stubbornly driving forward, you accept that the legs are leaving and upgrade to back exposure by getting your ear to their back and circling.  
  - This reinforces the global bias: if you lose leg control, win the back.

- Position / structure  
  - From a compromised double (legs starting to slip, hips going back), you post, bring your head around so your ear touches or nearly touches their back and free your outside leg.  
  - Hands transition from double control to a rear or side body lock as you circle behind their hips.  
  - Final position is side or rear body lock with knees off mat and chest close to their back.

- Key cues  
  - “If legs are leaving, find the back.”  
  - “Ear to back, then circle and lock.”  
  - “Don’t die on a losing double.”

- Drills & games  
  - Choice drill: from mid-double position, partner either gives you stable legs (you finish to mat) or strong back-directed sprawl (you must take ear-to-back route); you respond correctly to each cue.  
  - Back-priority rounds: any time your double stalls, you must immediately transition to ear-to-back finishes; continuing to drive straight is considered an error.

- System tags  
  - standup/elbow-deep-ear-to-back  
  - standup/double-to-back  
  - standup/front-to-rear-transitions


### 5.6 Opponent Underhooks / Te Guruma

- Key concepts  
  - When you shoot doubles, opponents often dig underhooks to stuff your head and lift your torso; this is both a threat and an opportunity.  
  - If they underhook and lift, you can redirect into high-amplitude counters like Te Guruma-style lifts, converting their underhook into a lever.  
  - Proper head and hip position keeps you safe from being front-headlocked while you exploit the underhook to load their hips.

- Position / structure  
  - Opponent underhooks your shooting side and tries to lift; you keep your hips under you and drive your head and shoulder into their ribs or hip.  
  - Your non-underhooked arm drops between their legs or around the far leg, “scooping” the hips onto your thigh.  
  - From there you lift and turn, rotating them over your hip line in a Te Guruma-style throw, aiming to land past their guard.

- Key cues  
  - “If he underhooks and lifts, load his hips.”  
  - “Head in tight, hips under, then scoop.”  
  - “Use his underhook as your elevator.”

- Drills & games  
  - Underhook response drill: partner is instructed to chase underhooks on all doubles; your job is to either clear underhooks or convert them into Te Guruma-style lifts.  
  - Landing-guard audit: track how often Te Guruma finishes land you past the legs versus inside guard and adjust angle and direction accordingly.

  - standup/underhook-counters  
  - standup/te-guruma-integration  
  - standup/double-defense-to-offense


### 5.7 High Double Leg

- Key concepts  
  - High doubles keep your knees largely off the mat and your torso upright, relying on shoulder pressure and leg drive rather than kneeling penetration.  
  - Safer for your neck and better for carrying sprawls because your hips stay under you and your head rarely dips under their chest.  
  - Particularly useful in no-gi where you want to avoid extended time on both knees under sprawl and guillotine threats.

- Position / structure  
  - Enter from broken stance or strong ties; catch both legs without fully dropping to your knee, or with only a brief knee touch.  
  - Head stays high on the chest or ribs, spine more vertical, hips close to theirs; feet keep moving to run them down.  
  - Hands climb quickly from knees to butt–hamstring lock so you can stand and drive rather than remain extended.

- Key cues  
  - “Knees light, head high, hips under.”  
  - “Touch the knee if you must, but don’t live there.”  
  - “Run them down, don’t dive under them.”

- Drills & games  
  - High-double entry drill: practise entries that either avoid kneeling completely or use a very brief knee touch; coach calls out any prolonged kneeling under sprawl as errors.  
  - Sprawl-carry rounds: partner actively sprawls; you must keep knees off the mat as much as possible while driving and finishing the high double.

- System tags  
  - standup/high-double  
  - standup/knees-off-mat-principle  
  - standup/sprawl-resilient-entries


### 5.8 One-Handed Snatch

- Key concepts  
  - One-handed snatch is a fast, opportunistic capture of the leg with a single hand when the opponent steps too close or exposes the leg.  
  - Works best from good head position and light ties where you can feel their step and snatch the leg without big level change.  
  - Important conceptually: not every leg capture needs a full two-handed, knees-down shot; sometimes a small one-handed catch is enough to start a strong attack.

- Position / structure  
  - From head-and-hands contact, you feel or provoke a step where the leg comes within easy reach.  
  - The near hand “snatches” behind the knee or ankle with a quick, tight hook while head and shoulder immediately come in to support the catch.  
  - Second hand joins quickly to upgrade to full single or double control; you do not hang out with only one hand on the leg for long.

- Key cues  
  - “When the leg walks into your hand, take it.”  
  - “Snatch, then immediately build structure.”  
  - “Don’t admire the catch; upgrade it.”

- Drills & games  
  - Step-and-snatch drill: partner walks and changes stance; you must call the step and snatch any leg that enters your “catch zone” with one hand, then immediately connect the second hand.  
  - Constraint rounds: you are only allowed to start leg attacks via one-handed snatches; no full two-handed shots allowed until after the initial catch.

  - standup/one-hand-snatch  
  - standup/opportunistic-entries  
  - standup/leg-catch-upgrades


### 5.9 Single Leg Takedown – Mechanics

- Key concepts  
  - Single legs are divided into classic singles (head inside, at least one knee on the floor) and high singles (knees off floor, leg elevated).  
  - Mechanics emphasise short entries that place your knees close to their foot, strong head position and elbow–hip integrity; you want to control the space between knee and hip, not the lower shin.  
  - Locking mechanics and head posture determine whether you can survive sprawls and weight shifts without giving up your neck or being stretched out.

- Position / structure  
  - Ideal entry: your knee lands close to their toes, not far behind, so they cannot easily retract the leg or stretch you out.  
  - Head stays up and pressed into the ribs or hip, never exposing the back of the head to downward weight.  
  - Hands lock around the leg with the “inside” arm usually underneath when possible, so attempts to split your hands run into the lock rather than pry them apart.

- Key cues  
  - “Knee near the toes, not halfway up the shin.”  
  - “Head up, ear tight; never show the back of your head.”  
  - “Inside arm under when you lock.”

- Drills & games  
  - Entry-position drill: practise dropping into single-leg entries where the knee lands within a hand’s breadth of the toes; anything further back is flagged as too long.  
  - Hand-lock resilience: from single-leg catches, partner tries to split your hands; you experiment with lock configurations and feel which preserve integrity under pulling.

  - standup/single-leg-mechanics  
  - standup/head-inside-single  
  - standup/elbow-hip-integrity


### 5.10 High Single Leg – Mechanics

- Key concepts  
  - High singles are single-leg attacks where your knees are off the mat and the leg is elevated; they trade some leg control for increased mobility and better posture.  
  - The goal is to dominate the space between knee and hip while using shoulder and head pressure to compromise their base.  
  - You must choose between square, “pinch the knees” stance (better foot control, less mobility) and side-on stance (better shoulder pressure and mobility, slightly less direct foot control).

- Position / structure  
  - From initial catch, you stand up and drive your head into the ribs, lifting the leg so their weight is compromised on the standing leg.  
  - Hands lock above the knee line; your elbow and ribs clamp the thigh and your shoulder drives into the hip.  
  - Option 1: square stance, both feet parallel, knees pinching their leg. Option 2: side-on stance with feet separated, shoulder pressure maximised and leg controlled more through the lock than knee pinching.

- Key cues  
  - “Dominate the thigh, not the ankle.”  
  - “Head into the ribs, leg high off the floor.”  
  - “Choose: pinch knees for clamp or side-on for pressure and movement.”

- Drills & games  
  - High-single posture drill: from catches, practise standing into high singles and holding posture while partner tries to pull leg free or push your head down.  
  - Stance-variation drill: alternate square pinch-knees high singles and side-on high singles and feel differences in mobility and control.

  - standup/high-single  
  - standup/thigh-dominance  
  - standup/standing-leg-control


### 5.11 Finishing Strategies for Single Legs

- Key concepts  
  - Finishes must fit the structure you have: kneeling singles, high singles and motion-based singles each lend themselves to different finishing trees.  
  - Good strategy alternates between (a) collapsing the standing leg with trips/turns and (b) climbing to doubles or body locks when leg control alone is not enough.  
  - You should think in chains (e.g., knee-pound to run-the-pipe to high single to double) rather than in isolated finishes.

- Position / structure  
  - Kneeling singles: use knee pounds, cutbacks and angles to bring their weight over the captured leg while you climb to your feet.  
  - High singles: once leg is elevated, step around and use inside or outside trips, knee bumps or pivots to knock the base out; keep head high and shoulder pressure continuous.  
  - Transition finishes: if the leg is stubborn, slide hands to pick up the second leg (transition to double) or climb to rear body lock as they turn.

- Key cues  
  - “If the leg won’t fall, upgrade the position.”  
  - “Collapse the base or add a second leg or the waist.”  
  - “Finishes live in chains, not one-offs.”

- Drills & games  
  - Chain-drilling: prescripted sequences like “single → high single → trip” and “single → high single → double” executed under moderate resistance.  
  - Finish-choice drill: from live single-leg catches, partner chooses to either balance bravely, hop away or turn; you must select the appropriate finish (trip, double, back take).

  - standup/single-leg-finish-tree  
  - standup/single-to-double  
  - standup/single-to-back


### 5.12 Inside Reach / Outside Reach

- Key concepts  
  - Inside reach and outside reach refer to how you approach the leg relative to your own centre line and the opponent’s stance.  
  - Inside reach patterns tend to attack the nearer leg from inside your stance, while outside reach patterns attack the leg from outside angle, often useful in opposite-stance scenarios.  
  - Each reach type has implications for head position (inside vs outside) and for which counters you are exposed to.

- Position / structure  
  - Inside reach: you step between their feet or toward their centre line and reach to the near leg; head usually ends up inside against their ribs or hip.  
  - Outside reach: you step outside their lead foot, reaching across to capture the far or back leg; head often tracks across their body, opening up back-take lanes.  
  - Structural rule: whichever reach you use, knee placement and head posture principles remain the same (knee close to toes, head never dropped and back exposed).

- Key cues  
  - “Choose reach based on stance and target leg.”  
  - “Inside reach = close leg, centre path; outside reach = angle and far leg.”  
  - “Different paths, same structural rules.”

- Drills & games  
  - Reach-mapping drill: from both same-side and opposite stances, practise inside and outside reaches and verbally label which leg is targeted and where your head ends up.  
  - Counter-awareness rounds: partner practises guillotines and sprawls against poor inside/outside reaches; your goal is to maintain correct posture while exploring both entry patterns.

  - standup/inside-vs-outside-reach  
  - standup/stance-specific-entries  
  - standup/head-position-vs-reach


### 5.13 Attacking the Back Leg and Attacking the Front Leg

- Key concepts  
  - Front-leg attacks are easiest to access but also the most expected; back-leg attacks are harder to reach but can be safer and strategically stronger.  
  - In many stances, the back leg is structurally less defended by frames and guillotines and can yield cleaner finishes or easier transitions to the back.  
  - The system wants you to understand when to prioritise front leg (speed and simplicity) versus when to turn and expose the back leg (safety, back-taking potential).

- Position / structure  
  - Front-leg attacks: use snaps, push–pull and stance manipulation to bring the lead leg into your “catch zone” and attack with doubles, singles or snatches.  
  - Back-leg attacks: use angles, drags and head passes to rotate the opponent so the back leg becomes effectively “front” relative to your entry lane.  
  - Often, attacking the back leg is paired with head and shoulder positioning that naturally exposes their back if they turn to defend.

- Key cues  
  - “Front leg is easy access; back leg is strategic access.”  
  - “Turn him until the back leg becomes the front leg you want.”  
  - “If front leg is crowded or dangerous, hunt the back leg instead.”

- Drills & games  
  - Leg-choice rounds: in some rounds you are only allowed to attack front leg; in others only back leg; this forces you to build specific setups for each.  
  - Angle-and-leg drill: begin by using snaps, drags or head passes to turn the opponent, then call out which leg is now “front” and immediately attack that leg.
