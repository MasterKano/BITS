# VIEWING NOTES – Standing to Ground 1: Takedowns and Standing Skills

## 4.0 Volume 4 — Double Legs: Advantages, Progression & Setups

### 4.1 Double Leg Takedown – Advantages and Disadvantages of Double Leg Takedowns

- Key concepts
  - Primary standing weapon for jiu-jitsu because controlling both legs drastically reduces scrambling and back-exposure risk compared with singles.
  - Double legs align strongly with jiu-jitsu scoring: hip control and chest-to-hip contact make it easier to hold down long enough to score and to funnel into passes or back takes.
  - Main disadvantages: higher energy cost, heavy sprawl exposure and substantial threat of guillotine and front-headlock counters if entries are naive or poorly set up.

- Position / structure
  - Ideal double-leg finish: hands locked high at the butt–hamstring junction, shoulder tight to hips, head high and chest inside base of support.
  - Single-leg comparison: single controls only one leg, leaving the free leg and hips able to hop, granby, entangle legs and threaten submissions.
  - Good doubles emphasise high contact on the hips/glutes, not low on the knees; this creates better control and safer landings.

- Key cues
  - “Two legs = less scramble.”
  - “Control hips, not just knees.”
  - “Doubles score and stabilise; singles scramble.”

- Drills & games
  - Double vs single outcomes: situational rounds where you alternate attempting doubles and singles from similar setups and track how often you actually stabilise top.
  - Hip vs knee grip drill: partner gives sprawling resistance while you alternate low knee grabs vs high butt–hamstring locks to feel the difference in control.

### 4.2 The Way Double Legs Are Typically Taught Is Wrong Headed

- Key concepts
  - Standard approach in many gyms: start with long-distance blast doubles on a standing, well-balanced opponent – the hardest possible scenario.
  - This maximises early failure: big entries from far away into strong sprawls and guillotines; students lose confidence and stop shooting.
  - Correct pedagogy is to start with high-control, short-distance doubles first, then progressively move out to harder distances and weaker control.

- Position / structure
  - Typical “wrong” teaching: no prior stance break, long penetration step, big level change, head outside against a strong sprawl and active guillotine threat.
  - Improved progression: begin from broken stance, hands on mat, front headlock or other strong upper-body controls where sprawl and submissions are blunted.

- Key cues
  - “Don’t start with the hardest version.”
  - “First learn doubles where defence is weakest.”
  - “Control first, distance later.”

- Drills & games
  - Failure audit: film ordinary rounds and count how many “distance doubles” succeed vs attempts from strong ties; use numbers to justify progression.
  - Progressive range drill: start doubles from front headlock only → then from reverse overback → then from collars/2-on-1s → only then from full distance.

### 4.3 The First Double Legs to Learn – Reverse Overback Double Leg

- Key concepts
  - Reverse overback double is presented as the easiest double for most athletes to learn: hands locked behind armpits, opponent’s hands on floor, head on the outside.
  - You already have hands-to-mat and severe stance break; distance to cover is minimal, submission threats are low and leg access is clean.
  - Strategy: use snapdowns or ties to put hands on the mat, then immediately lock reverse overback and drop into a short double.

- Position / structure
  - Reverse overback: both arms loop behind opponent’s armpits, hands locked behind upper back, head on the side opposite your lock (not in front).
  - Typical route: head-and-hands tie → heavy snapdowns until hands touch mat → step in and lock reverse overback while their hands are still low → short penetration to legs.
  - Finish emphasises getting chest to thighs and hands quickly transitioning from upper body to a high double-lock around the legs.

- Key cues
  - “First break hands to the floor, then think double.”
  - “Lock behind armpits, head out, then drop to legs.”
  - “You don’t have to win the shot; you’ve already won the stance.”

- Drills & games
  - Hands-to-mat → reverse overback drill: partner must put at least one hand to mat from snaps; attacker has a 1–2 second window to lock reverse overback and convert to double.
  - Timing flow: alternating rounds (snap-only, then snap-to-reverse-overback, then reverse-overback-to-double) to build seamless transitions.

  - standup/hands-to-mat-to-double
  - standup/easy-entry-doubles


### 4.4 Front Headlock Double Leg

- Key concepts
  - Front headlock is another high-control hub from which doubles become far easier: opponent’s posture is broken, hands are often on mat or at least occupied.
  - Goal is not primarily to finish from the front; instead, use the head control to walk them into a short, high-percentage double.
  - Front headlock doubles mimic reverse overback logic: strong upper-body control first, then short leg entry second.

- Position / structure
  - Standard front headlock: head-and-arm control with your chest heavy on back of neck and structural frames blocking shots.
  - As they try to stand or sprawl, you step to an angle, release to a body-in-tight position and drop hands from head/arm to the legs in one motion.
  - Head remains high and to the side; emphasis is on capturing both knees/hips quickly and avoiding guillotine-style counters.

- Key cues
  - “Front headlock first, double second.”
  - “Walk them, then drop to the legs when they try to stand.”
  - “Use the headlock to win posture, not just to chase submissions.”

- Drills & games
  - Front-headlock to double chain: from front headlock start, partner tries to stand or sprawl; attacker must convert to double within a small number of beats.
  - Headlock choice rounds: from front headlock, attacker must either (a) spin to back or (b) convert to double; no static front chokes allowed.

  - standup/head-control-hub
  - standup/short-range-doubles


### 4.5 Short Double Leg

- Key concepts
  - Short doubles are doubles taken at close range from tie-ups, not from across the mat; distance and level change are both reduced.
  - Concept is to first get close with head and hands, break stance, then “fall” into a compact double where hips stay under you.
  - Short doubles are more realistic for most jiu-jitsu athletes than big blast doubles and integrate well with clinch-style games.

- Position / structure
  - Start from forehead-to-head contact with tight elbows and one or more grips (collar, bicep, wrist).
  - Use push–pull and angle to square them and bring your shoulder close to their hip line; then a shallow penetration step drops you directly under the hips.
  - Hands connect behind knees/upper calves, quickly climbing to a high lock; your torso stays upright enough to carry sprawl weight.

- Key cues
  - “Get close, then go.”
  - “Short step, big structure.”
  - “Tie, square, then fall into their hips.”

- Drills & games
  - Distance ladder: drill the same double from three distances (very short, medium, long) with emphasis on mechanics at the short end first.
  - Close-range sparring: start rounds already in head-and-hands contact and forbid long-distance shots; players must find short doubles only.

  - standup/clinch-to-double
  - standup/distance-management


### 4.6 The Second Double Legs to Learn – Pull Double Leg

- Key concepts
  - Pull double leverages the fact that most people can pull better than they can explosively drive forward.
  - Instead of your legs doing the shot, your upper body pull acts like the “shot,” dragging them towards you and into a double.
  - Uses a shoulder bump to provoke an elbow grab, then converts elbow/tricep control into a strong pulling entry to the legs.

- Position / structure
  - Starting from neutral head and hand contact, you bump their shoulder; they instinctively grab your elbow.
  - You slide hand down from elbow to tricep while keeping head in good position; then level change and pull their shoulder and tricep towards you.
  - The pull brings their legs to you; you drop under into a tight double, lock hands and cut the corner to finish.

- Key cues
  - “Bump the shoulder, make him grab, then pull him into your shot.”
  - “Pull like the pull is the shot.”
  - “Let his reaction create the angle and distance.”

- Drills & games
  - Reaction pattern: bump → elbow grab → tricep slide → pull and double; partner is instructed to give realistic elbow grabs every time.
  - Pull vs push comparison: alternate traditional driving doubles with pull doubles and note effort and success differences.

  - standup/pull-double
  - standup/reaction-based-entries
  - standup/upper-body-driven-shots


### 4.7 Snap Double

- Key concepts
  - Snap double combines stance-breaking snapdowns with immediate doubles; it exploits predictable reactions to being snapped.
  - Core dilemma: if opponent pulls back aggressively from snap, legs become exposed for doubles; if they don’t pull back, hands hit mat and front headlock opportunities appear.
  - Very high-yield setup because opponents must respect the snap; either reaction benefits you.

- Position / structure
  - Start with active head-and-hands fight; elevate your hands slightly above theirs, then snap their head or shoulders down.
  - As they recoil upward to escape the snap, their hips come closer and frames disappear; you drive in with head and shoulder, catching legs in that moment.
  - Hands lock quickly behind legs; if they instead drop hands to mat, you climb to front headlock instead of shooting.

- Key cues
  - “Snap to make them stand; shoot when they recoil.”
  - “If hands go down, take the head; if head goes up, take the legs.”
  - “Snap is the question; double is one of the answers.”

- Drills & games
  - Snap-reaction drill: partner must either (a) pull back from snap or (b) drop hands; attacker must instantly choose double or headlock accordingly.
  - Tempo rounds: continuous light snaps, each followed by a potential entry, to build timing and conditioning.

  - standup/snapdown-dilemmas
  - standup/stance-break-to-shot


### 4.8 Post Double

- Key concepts
  - Post double uses a hand post (usually on forehead or shoulder) to straighten opponent and clear their arms before dropping under for a double.
  - Strategic aim is to lift their posture and hands away from the shot lane, then pass under the posting arm into the legs.
  - Especially useful against opponents who carry their head low or crowd into collar ties.

- Position / structure
  - From head-and-hands, establish a firm post on their forehead or shoulder while keeping the other hand defensive.
  - Push them slightly away and up, elongating their stance and raising their hands; then drop under the posted arm with a level change and penetration step.
  - Immediately transfer hand from post to leg while the other arm collects the far leg; lock and complete as usual.

- Key cues
  - “Post to raise, then shoot under the post.”
  - “Lift the frame out of the lane, then go through the empty door.”
  - “Push their head away so their legs come closer.”

- Drills & games
  - Post-to-shot drill: repeated sequences of post–lift–level-change–double, focusing on smooth hand transfer from head/shoulder to knee.
  - Low-head opponent games: training partner keeps head low; your only task is to use posts to create posture and then enter.

  - standup/head-post-entries
  - standup/low-head-answers


### 4.9 Arm Drag Double

- Key concepts
  - Arm drag double links classical dragging into doubles; dragging the arm across opens hips and clears a path to both legs.
  - Works best when used as part of a 2-on-1/arm-drag system, not as a one-off move.
  - Emphasises using drag to place your head and shoulder beside their hip, then dropping into a high double.

- Position / structure
  - From hand fighting, establish an arm drag or 2-on-1 (palm up / palm down or similar).
  - Step and drag their arm across your body, pulling them slightly forward and sideways, exposing legs on the dragged side.
  - As you drag, level change and step to the outside hip; hands release the arm and immediately collect both legs for a double.

- Key cues
  - “Drag the arm, then own the hips.”
  - “Arm across, head to the side, then double.”
  - “Use the drag to clear the lane, not to admire the angle.”

- Drills & games
  - Drag-to-double chains: each successful drag must be followed either by a back-take attempt or a double; no static drags allowed.
  - 2-on-1 sparring: rounds where obtaining a 2-on-1 is the trigger to immediately attempt drag double or back exposure.

  - standup/arm-drag-double
  - standup/back-or-double-funnels


### 4.10 Misdirection Double

- Key concepts
  - Misdirection double exploits the natural tendency of opponents to step or sprawl away from your initial attack line; you feint one direction and finish to the other.
  - Especially effective against athletes who are reactive and good at taking their legs back.
  - Uses inside ties and small steps to draw them in, then switches attack direction as they step.

- Position / structure
  - Establish an inside tie or light wrist control; take a small step and pull that encourages them to step in a predictable direction (e.g., back or sideways).
  - As they step or shift weight away, you switch your attack angle across their body to the opposite side, catching the leg that is now stepping into you.
  - Hands target the knee/upper calf with a strong anatomical grip; as they step back, the grip pulls you in and deepens connection.

- Key cues
  - “Step and pull one way, shoot the other.”
  - “Use his step as your penetration step.”
  - “Grab where the step drags you in.”

- Drills & games
  - Step-reading drill: practise making partner step with inside tie, then calling which leg stepped and entering misdirection double accordingly.
  - Live misdirection rounds: you only score if your attack direction at entry is opposite to the initial pulling/steering direction.

### 4.11 The Third Double Legs to Learn – Shooting From Distance

- Key concepts
  - Only after mastering high-control and mid-range doubles should you move to full-distance shots.
  - Distance doubles demand the most athleticism and carry the highest risk; they must be built on solid preliminaries and shot mechanics.
  - Objective is to enter from open space with no initial grip, still respecting defensive responsibility and posture rules.

- Position / structure
  - From open stance, you manage distance with footwork and fakes rather than immediate ties.
  - Entry requires a longer penetration step, deeper level change and strong shoulder contact to hips while avoiding exposing the back of the neck.
  - Emphasis on covering distance in a way that leaves you upright enough to carry sprawl and climb to a high lock.

- Key cues
  - “Outside shots are last, not first.”
  - “Earn distance doubles with good preliminaries.”
  - “Entry from space, finish like a short double.”

- Drills & games
  - Shot-distance ladder: start entries from progressively further away, only after you can consistently hit short and mid-range doubles mechanically well.
  - Open-position-only rounds: no initial ties allowed; you must create your own outside-shot entries using fakes and footwork.

  - standup/long-range-doubles
  - standup/athletic-entry-progression


### 4.12 The Number One Setup For Outside Shots: Fake Reach

- Key concepts
  - Fake reach is highlighted as the best setup for outside doubles: create an expectation that you want upper-body ties, then go under the reaching exchange.
  - You repeatedly come out, put hands on them and “look” like you want to tie up; then on a later repetition you fake the reach and shoot underneath.
  - This plays on the opponent’s habit: if they expect hand fighting, they raise their hands to meet you and open a lane underneath.

- Position / structure
  - From open distance, you approach with standard head-level match and elbows in.
  - First and second engagements: actually reach, touch, and move them around a bit to build the pattern of hand contact.
  - On the third or a later approach, you show the same reach but instead drop level and slide under as their hands rise to meet yours, entering directly to the legs.

- Key cues
  - “Reach, move; reach, move; reach, fake, shoot.”
  - “Convince them you want ties, then go under the tie.”
  - “Create expectation high, then attack low.”

- Drills & games
  - Three-step fake-reach drill: enforced pattern of real reach–real reach–fake reach into shot against a partner who’s instructed to reach back.
  - Expectation-building rounds: for the first half of a round, you may only hand fight; second half, you can use fake reach entries to double.

  - standup/open-position-entries
  - standup/deception-based-setups


### 4.13 Double Knee Slide Method

- Key concepts
  - Double knee slide is a specific outside-shot mechanic to safely cover more distance while keeping posture safer and impact on the neck lower than classic blast doubles.
  - Uses two sequential knee slides (often from a deliberately opposite stance) to close space, get shoulder to hip and keep torso upright enough to carry full sprawls.
  - Especially suited to jiu-jitsu athletes worried about neck stress from head-first blast doubles.

- Position / structure
  - Often start in “wrong” stance (e.g., left stance if you normally stand right) to optimise the two-step knee path.
  - First knee drops and slides forward, then second knee slides deeper, bringing shoulder into high hip contact and hands to the butt–hamstring junction rather than behind knees.
  - Hips stay under you and torso upright; as opponent sprawls, you can carry the weight, stand back up into a high double lock and run them down.

- Key cues
  - “Two knee slides to cover twice the distance.”
  - “Start opposite stance, slide–slide, then stand into the lock.”
  - “Shoulder to hips, hands high, neck safe.”

- Drills & games
  - Knee-slide isolation: drill left–right knee-slide sequences without partner first, then add a partner’s sprawl and focus on posture and lock conversion.
  - Neck-friendly shot rounds: for athletes with neck concerns, replace blast doubles with double knee slides during outside-shot practice and compare recovery and control.
