# VN – Standing to Ground 1: Takedowns and Standing Skills

## 1.0 Volume 1 – Risk, Aftermath & Stance Foundations

### 1.1 Intro

- Key ideas: Standing in no-gi jiu-jitsu is structurally different from wrestling/judo because of submissions, being barefoot, no referee rescues and different scoring; you cannot simply import their takedowns unchanged.
- Risk vs other arts: In wrestling/judo, failed takedowns can often be hidden in stalemates or turtle while the referee intervenes; in jiu-jitsu failed shots can immediately become submissions or back exposure with no reset.
- Shoes vs barefoot: Shoes improve drive for leg tackles but make foot sweeps harder; barefoot grappling makes many trips and foot-retraction defences easier and changes which finishing mechanics are realistic.
- Historical weakness: Standing and leg locks were historically the two big weak areas in jiu-jitsu; leg locks progressed once jiu-jitsu developed its own systems instead of outsourcing to sambo – he wants the same evolution for stand-up.
- Project definition: Build a jiu-jitsu-specific standing system: technique can be inspired by wrestling/judo, but selection, risk management and finishing must be tuned to submissions, long rounds and current scoring.
- System hooks: standup/overview, standup/ruleset-differences, standup/risk-profile.

### 1.2 The 4 Most Important Ideas – Avoid Carrying Your Opponent’s Weight

- Core principle: Wherever possible, avoid carrying opponent weight in destructive ways; your posture under sprawl pressure is more important than completing any single takedown.
- Good vs bad weight: Worst case is opponent’s weight on the back of your head and shoulders with your chest projected past your base; this exhausts you, lowers success rate and invites counters/submissions.
- Weight-bearing posture: Chest stays inside your base of support (knee/foot line), spine relatively upright, hips under you; you can carry their weight and still transition between attacks or exit.
- Head contact rule: Always connect with forehead/temple to their upper body; never expose the back of your head or shoulders for them to hang on.
- Knees off the mat: If you must drop to your knees to enter (because of a low stance), the high-percentage pattern is “shoot to knees → immediately get back off your knees to finish” – standing finishes manage weight better and are safer.
- High vs low shots: Prefer high doubles/singles when stance allows; if opponent is very bent over you may need to go to knees, but still aim to finish on your feet.
- Posture-first hierarchy: “Posture first, takedown second”; if you feel posture breaking, abandon the attack to save posture so you can chain to another attack instead of dying under a sprawl.
- Training emphasis: Drill with realistic sprawls early; every leg-entry drill should include the experience of carrying some partner weight while maintaining forehead/temple contact, chest inside base and getting off knees.
- System hooks: standup/posture-management, standup/sprawl-handling, standup/takedown-chaining.

### 1.3 Focus on the Easier Takedowns First

- Difficulty factors: Takedowns are hard because they often require three things at once – covering distance, deep level change and managing a heavy sprawl.
- “Easy” takedowns: Early focus should go to attacks that reduce one or more of those demands – e.g. takedowns from front headlock, from the back, or re-shots where the opponent has already given you distance and level change.
- Front headlock entries: From strong front headlocks there is little distance to cover, level change is already done and the opponent’s sprawl is weakened by their head position.
- Re-shots: When opponent shoots badly, they give you distance and level change; you simply meet them, sprawl, then come back up into your own double/single as they rise.
- Takedowns from the back: From rear body lock or back control, there is minimal sprawl threat and few submissions; finishes are lower risk and higher control.
- Psychological angle: If you start by only drilling long-distance shots against good defence, failure rate and physical misery make you gun-shy; easier families build confidence and keep you attacking.
- Curriculum logic: Build from easy-control scenarios (front head, back, bad opponent shots) → short-range doubles/singles → only then full-distance shots.
- System hooks: standup/takedown-progression, standup/front-headlock-tree, standup/back-takedowns.

### 1.4 Hand Fight With Direction

- Purpose of hand fighting: Hand fighting is not random slapping; its job is to remove the obstacles (head, hands, forearms, elbows) that prevent access to legs and back.
- Three hand-fight goals:
  - Put the opponent’s hands on the mat – hands occupied = weaker defence and easy entries/spins.
  - Get outside their elbows – once outside the elbow line, there is almost nothing between you and their legs/back.
  - Create a straight, unobstructed head-and-shoulder lane from you to their legs.
- Directional principle: Every tie, snap, push and pull must work toward one or more of those three conditions; otherwise you are just burning grip and time.
- Integration with setups: These three conditions define the “setup phase” of leg attacks – no stance break / no hand drop / no elbow-beat = no real setup.
- Training cue: When reviewing footage, every exchange should be graded: did your hand fighting move feet, drop hands, beat elbows or open a lane? If not, it was empty work.
- System hooks: standup/hand-fighting-fundamentals, standup/stance-breaking.

### 1.5 Aftermath of the Takedown = As Important as the Takedown

- Scoring reality: Under common jiu-jitsu rules, you only score if there is controlled pinning after the takedown and no active submission threat; the throw itself often scores nothing.
- Submission overrides: If the opponent locks a realistic submission (e.g. guillotine, kimura) during the takedown, you get no points until you clear the threat, regardless of how nice the throw looked.
- Control-time requirement: You must hold them with shoulders or upper body pinned (or both knees under some rule sets) for several seconds; they can post, scramble and stand during that window to kill the score.
- Comparison to wrestling/judo: Many actions that are clear scores in wrestling/judo – back exposure, amplitude – are zero in jiu-jitsu if there’s no follow-up control or there’s a submission hanging on.
- Practical outcome: It is “damn hard” to score classical takedown points against a resisting opponent who doesn’t want to be held down; they can sit, stand, turn and deny shoulder pins.
- Back-exposure bias: In practice, most scoring after takedowns comes from back takes in the three seconds after impact as the opponent turns to stand or escape; takedown → back take chain is the real scoring engine.
- Strategic shift: You must design takedowns and finishes with the follow-up in mind: how does this entry lead into back exposure or stable top, not just knocking them down.
- Training metric: Track “takedown to stable top/back” success rather than just “putting them down”; treat any finish that lands you in neutral or dangerous guard as low-value.
- System hooks: standup/scoring-strategy, standup/takedown-to-back, standup/takedown-aftermath.

### 1.6 Standing Preliminaries – Stance: Defensive Responsibility

- Defensive responsibility: You must never offer a straight, unobstructed line from opponent’s head to your legs; something (head, hands, elbows) must always be in that lane.
- Head-level matching: Match opponent’s head level; if their head is much lower you invite shots, if yours is much lower you invite guillotines and front headlocks.
- Alignment: Keep your head aligned in front of theirs; if they move their head off-line and you don’t track, they get angular head position for entries.
- Short neck: Shrug shoulders toward ears to shorten the neck; this reduces lever length for collar ties and makes it harder for them to get deep head control.
- Hands and elbows as second-layer defence: When head-level alignment fails, at least one arm must be between their head and your hips so their shot runs into forearms and elbows, not straight to legs.
- Lead-leg protection: Whichever leg is more vulnerable must be “covered” by a defensive arm in front of it; never have both hands high while your lead leg is naked.
- Stance options: He does not insist on one universal stance; instead, whatever stance you use must maintain defensive responsibility and support both offence and defence under jiu-jitsu rules.
- System hooks: standup/stance-defence, standup/head-position-defence.

### 1.7 Stance: The Beginnings of Offense

- Trade-off: As soon as you reach for grips, you partially compromise your defensive shell – the problem is how to reach while keeping at least one strong defensive arm.
- Rear-hand initiation pattern: Classic method is “front hand shields, rear hand reaches”; lead hand stays down guarding the shot lane while rear hand establishes collar/shoulder ties.
- Lead-leg–matched defence: Alternative pattern – whichever of opponent’s legs is forward, you match it with a defensive hand on that side and reach with the opposite hand; if they switch stance, you switch defensive hand.
- Posting strategies:
  - Head post: Palm on forehead with other hand/arm defensive; good vs low, dangerous stances but must be done carefully (no eye pokes).
  - Shoulder post: Palm on near shoulder combined with a quick shock step; jolt breaks stance and doubles as a “jab” that keeps them from entering.
- Pulling ties:
  - Underhooked shoulder pulls (they post on your shoulder, you swim inside and pull).
  - Lead or rear-hand snaps that combine a small step and pull to force them to step.
- Push–pull integration: Offence starts when you blend head/hand pushes (forehead, shoulder posts) with sharp pulls (collar/shoulder, underhook pulls) to move stance and open legs.
- Rule: Any reaching that leaves both hands above their shoulders without a defensive shield is unacceptable; reach patterns must be married to clear defensive hand rules.
- System hooks: standup/first-contact, standup/grip-entry, standup/push-pull.

### 1.8 Stance: Vision

- Eye focus: Central vision should be on the opponent’s collarbones, not on eyes, feet or hands.
- Why not eyes: Eyes are deceptive and emotionally distracting; opponents can fake with gaze and you get “lost” in their face.
- Why not feet/hands: If you stare at feet your head drops and you get snapped; if you stare at hands you overreact to feints and miss level change cues.
- Collarbone advantage: Collarbone movement honestly reveals level changes (they can’t drop the collarbones without lowering head/torso) while allowing good head posture.
- Peripheral vision: Hands and feet should be tracked peripherally – you see steps and grip fighting without compromising posture or focus.
- System hooks: standup/stance-vision, standup/reaction-training.

### 1.9 Same Side and Opposite Side Stances

- Same-side stance (right vs right): Your lead side lines up with their centre line; spacing between lead feet is larger and ties feel more “natural” with less hand clash.
- Opposite-side stance (right vs left): Lead feet are closer and aligned; there is more lead-hand clash and higher risk of stepping on each other’s feet.
- Opposite-stance implications:
  - Their lead hand is very close to your head and shot lane; you must be serious about clearing or controlling that hand.
  - Footwork emphasises stepping inside or outside their lead foot, not straight into it, to avoid jammed entries.
- Lead-hand management: In opposite stances, a big part of the battle is occupying, beating or clearing their lead arm to open lanes for shots and body locks.
- Strategy: Treat stance interactions as part of your tactical plan – you should know what you want from same-side vs opposite-side and how your primary attacks map to each.
- System hooks: standup/stance-interactions, standup/same-vs-opposite-stance.

### 1.10 Motion

- Movement requirement: Standing grappling involves much more continuous motion than ground work; you must move without breaking stance integrity.
- Short steps: Use short, choppy steps so your feet never come too close together (easy double) or too far apart (easy single and balance break).
- Directional rule:
  - Moving forward: lead foot steps first, then trail foot, preserving stance width.
  - Moving back: back foot first, then front.
  - Lateral: step with the foot in the direction you are moving, then recover.
- Stance preservation: The goal is to disturb your stance as little as possible during motion; you should be able to defend a shot at any moment mid-step.
- Stance switching: Naively switching stance in front of opponent squares your hips and gives free shots; if you switch, do it while backing away or while they are moving away/off-balanced.
- Coaching lens: Judge your footwork by how little it compromises your defensive responsibility rather than how “pretty” it looks.
- System hooks: standup/footwork-basics, standup/stance-maintenance.

### 1.11 Contact and Grip – First Contact

- Head-and-hands strategy: Very common competitive pattern is to close distance into forehead-to-forehead, elbows back, then tie up wrists/hands; this uses the head as first barrier, hands as second.
- Hand grips:
  - Hand-on-hand or finger interlock: defensively strong but offensively dead – mainly a stalling grip.
  - Wrist control (top or bottom): more offensive; top grips clear arms aside, bottom grips pull arms across for drags.
- Head push: Forehead used to push and steer, but must not drift far in front of your base or you overextend and invite snaps/throws.
- Head/hand posts:
  - Palm on forehead with opposite defensive hand – good against low stances.
  - Palm on shoulder with opposite defensive hand – safe, can be used assertively to shock stance and then pull.
- Undergrip responses: When they post on your shoulder, swimming inside to an undergrip and using it to pull them into steps.
- Push–pull chains: Combine head/shoulder pushes with undergrip or collar pulls to move feet, create angle and climb the stance-breaking ladder.
- Safety: Posts must always be backed by a second defensive arm; reaching with both hands high and no shield is not acceptable contact.
- System hooks: standup/head-and-hands-control, standup/grip-families.

### 1.12 Angle Within Your Opponent’s Elbows

- Angles inside vs outside elbows: Ideal is to get outside the elbow line on the way to the back, but against skilled opponents most realistic angles are small ones inside the elbows.
- Micro-angle concept: From neutral forehead-to-forehead, even half a forehead’s width of lateral movement (forehead to collarbone instead of forehead to forehead) creates serious advantage.
- Effect of micro-angles: When your forehead is on their collarbone/jaw and theirs is not on yours, your pushes drive diagonally across their body toward legs/back instead of straight into stance.
- Realistic expectation: Big outside-elbow angles are “home runs” but rare against good defence; small internal angles happen constantly and must be recognised and exploited.
- Symmetric ties problem: Ear-to-ear collar tie + elbow tie on both sides gives no inherent advantage – you both have the same grips and angle; this is acceptable for stalling but poor for scoring.
- Asymmetric ties: What you want is you having the forehead-to-collarbone angle while they remain neutral; symmetric versions of that tie are low-value.
- Drill idea: From head-to-head hand fighting, repeatedly hunt for small slips that put your forehead on their collarbone on one side, then immediately convert that angle into pushes, snaps or entries.
- System hooks: standup/angle-creation, standup/head-position-offence, standup/stance-breaking-ladder.
