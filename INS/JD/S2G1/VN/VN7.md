## 7.0 Volume 7 — High-Leg Single Systems & Defensive Problem-Solving

### 7.1 High-Leg Finishing Framework from Single Leg

- Key concepts
  - Finishing strategy from single leg is organised into three broad routes: (1) fast finish on the captured leg, (2) switch to a double leg, or (3) raise the leg to a high-leg position.
  - High leg (leg lifted to chest height or higher) removes many of the opponent’s best submission counters (guillotines, kimuras, a large portion of leg locks) and makes balance much more fragile.
  - High leg can be taken to the inside (in front of chest) or outside (toward the back); inside high leg is generally preferred for no-gi jiu-jitsu.

- Position / structure
  - Start from classic single-leg: head tight, elbow deep, leg between your legs, good stance.
  - Transition to high leg by sliding the hands down and lifting so the opponent’s foot travels up the line of your chest; hips forward, chest tall.
  - Maintain upper-body posture (no bending over with elbows in front) so you can walk and apply finishing mechanics without being off-balanced.

- Key cues
  - “Three paths: quick leg finish, double, or high leg.”
  - “High leg kills most of his submission counters.”
  - “Leg up on your chest line before you start fancy finishes.”

- Drills & games
  - Flow drill: single-leg catch → quick finish attempt → if it stalls, transition to double; if that stalls, go to high leg.
  - Constraint rounds where every stalled single must be escalated to a high leg before you are allowed to disengage or change attacks.

### 7.2 De Ashi Harai from High Leg (Front-Leg Sweep)

- Key concepts
  - De ashi harai (front-foot sweep) is used when you have an inside high leg and want a low-amplitude, controlled takedown.
  - The sweep only works if the support foot is momentarily weightless; the lift of the high leg creates that weightlessness.

- Position / structure
  - Attack lead leg with triceps grip and level change; catch behind the knee and convert to single.
  - When the single stalls, drop elbow deep, slide hand toward heel, and elevate to inside high leg with hips forward.
  - Replace your support foot so that one leg becomes the sweeping leg and the other becomes the base; sweep the support foot as it “floats.”

- Key cues
  - “Lift to make the foot light, then sweep.”
  - “Replace one foot with the other before you sweep.”
  - “Sweep in the direction he’s already hopping.”

- Drills & games
  - High-leg balance drill: partner hops while you search for the precise instant when the support foot becomes light and sweep with minimal force.
  - Cooperative pattern: triceps entry → single → high leg → de ashi harai, focusing on timing and clean, low-impact landings.

  - standup/front-leg-attacks


### 7.3 High-Leg Knee Pressure Finishes

- Key concepts
  - High-leg knee-pressure finishes use your forearm and torso rotation to collapse the standing leg via the knee line, not by kicking the foot.
  - Emphasis is on conservative, low-athleticism mechanics that suit less explosive athletes.

- Position / structure
  - From inside high leg, keep one hand maintaining leg height while the other forearm or wrist posts on the outside or top of the opponent’s knee.
  - Rotate your body and step/back-step so your legs generate the torque; arm serves as a conduit, not the main power source.
  - The rotation forces hands to the mat; you then transition to hips or a reverse double on the ground.

- Key cues
  - “Arms transmit, legs create the power.”
  - “Roll the knee as you step, don’t just push with your arm.”
  - “Hands to the mat, then collect hips or both knees.”

- Drills & games
  - Outside-knee-roll drill: partner balances while you practise small rotational steps that roll the knee and bring hands down.
  - Direction-switch drill: alternate between “roll” and “press straight down” knee pressures, learning to combine them depending on resistance.

  - standup/high-leg-knee-pressure
  - standup/conservative-finishes


### 7.4 Harai Ogoshi-Style High-Leg Finish

- Key concepts
  - From high leg, you can use a harai ogoshi-style sweeping action on the far leg with your hip and leg, forcing hands to the mat and exposing the back.
  - This leverages powerful leg mechanics rather than fine foot-sweeping timing alone.

- Position / structure
  - Inside high leg in front of chest; step across in front of the opponent so your leg can sweep his far leg.
  - Switch to a hand grip that frees your sweeping leg; use hip turn and leg swing to take the support leg away while upper body controls the high leg.
  - As hands go down, transition immediately to waist or reverse double, then to back-exposure breakdowns.

- Key cues
  - “Use your leg as the main weapon, not your arms.”
  - “Step across, sweep the far leg, make his hands catch his fall.”
  - “Hands on the floor means the back is coming.”

- Drills & games
  - Pattern drill: single → inside high leg → step across → harai-style sweep → immediate transition to hip or double control.
  - Back-exposure rounds: any time you put hands on the floor from this finish, you must chase the back rather than settle for guard.

  - standup/back-exposure-from-sweeps


### 7.5 Tree-Top and Super High-Leg Finishes

- Key concepts
  - Tree-topping converts inside high leg to an extremely high leg (foot up near collarbones) to further destroy balance.
  - The critical safety rule: only tree-top once the opponent’s lower leg fully follows the line of your chest; otherwise, you are fighting leg strength with arm strength and inviting counters.

- Position / structure
  - From inside high leg (foot on chest line, hips forward), replace your original hand with the opposite hand and cross wrists to lift the foot toward the collarbones.
  - Maintain posture: shoulders back, hips in, leg high; avoid bent-over positions.
  - Once treetopped, you can:
    - Sweep the base foot by feel (shoelaces finding his ankle).
    - Run the opponent down with forward pressure.
    - Pull head toward knee and circle for a big-but-controlled finish.

- Key cues
  - “Tree-top only when shin is on your chest line.”
  - “Hips in, shoulders back; don’t fold over your treetop.”
  - “Find his base foot by feel, not by looking.”

- Drills & games
  - Height drill: practice safely raising the leg from single → high leg → treetop → extreme treetop without losing posture.
  - Option drill: from treetop, rotate among three finishes (foot sweep, run-down, head-to-knee circle) based on partner’s reactions.

  - standup/extreme-high-leg
  - standup/head-control-finishes


### 7.6 High-Leg Thigh Pry to Backside Double

- Key concepts
  - Thigh pry from high leg is even stronger than from classic single because your shoulder can sit deeply behind the hamstring while the leg is already elevated.
  - The goal is to straighten/join the legs, then collect both knees from the back and drive to a broken-down position.

- Position / structure
  - From inside high leg, turn slightly so your shoulder wedges behind the hamstring of the support leg.
  - Clamp your shoulder and arm above the knee line and circle away to straighten the leg and force hands toward the mat.
  - Slide to a backside double, locking above both knees, then walk the opponent down into a flattened or turning position.

- Key cues
  - “Turn and put your shoulder behind the hamstring.”
  - “Circle away to join and straighten his legs.”
  - “Above the knees, not on the calves, when you collect the double.”

- Drills & games
  - High-leg → thigh-pry drill: starting in high leg, practise turning into shoulder position and circling to join the legs, then transitioning to backside double.
  - Finish-choice rounds: from high leg, you must choose between knee-pressure finishes, harai-style sweep, or thigh-pry-to-backside-double depending on which structure presents itself.

### 7.7 Outside High Leg and Shoulder-Pummel Finish

- Key concepts
  - Outside high leg (foot behind your back) is less preferred in jiu-jitsu because it allows guard pulls, flying submissions and keeps the opponent square, but it occurs often due to common wrestling-style defences.
  - The main finishing idea here is to “shoulder-pummel” his thigh to force his post hand to the mat, then pull the leg up to your chest.

- Position / structure
  - From classic single, opponent threads the foot to the outside; you maintain grip and bring your shoulder hard into the outside of the thigh.
  - Use shoulder pressure to drive one of his hands to the mat while maintaining leg control.
  - As he tries to recover posture, punch your elbow through and come up into an outside high-leg or transition to double/back position.

- Key cues
  - “If he feeds the foot outside, you owe him a shoulder-pummel.”
  - “Shoulder puts his hand on the floor; elbow punch brings the leg up.”
  - “From outside high leg, finish quickly or convert to double/back before he jumps guard.”

- Drills & games
  - Defence-driven entries: partner is instructed to feed the leg outside on every single; you must respond with shoulder-pummel and outside-high-leg finishes.
  - Guard-risk awareness: in drilling, note and avoid postures from outside high leg that would allow guard jumps or flying attacks.

### 7.8 Dealing with Limp-Leg Escape (Duck-Under Back Take)

- Key concepts
  - Limp-leg escape (posting on your head/neck, moving knee above your grip and turning it down to slip out) is the most common and frustrating single-leg defence in no-shoes jiu-jitsu.
  - Core advice: do not try to beat a strong limp-leg by stubbornly squeezing your hands; instead, anticipate it and transition.

- Position / structure
  - From single or high single, once you see/feel the opponent framing on your neck, recognise that a limp-leg is likely.
  - Before he fully kicks free, release the lock and catch the calf/ankle with one hand while mirroring his frame with a frame of your own at the hip.
  - Duck your head under his framing arm (duck-under style) as you rotate to the back, feeding your hand from calf to hip control.

- Key cues
  - “Frame vs frame; don’t fight his leg with just your grip.”
  - “When he posts to limp-leg, grab calf and duck under the post.”
  - “Use his escape attempt to give you the back instead of losing everything.”

- Drills & games
  - Cooperative reps: partner deliberately limp-legs; you practise timing: catch calf, frame hip, duck under, arrive at back or rear body lock.
  - Constraint rounds: any time opponent limp-legs successfully, you “lose” the exchange; your job is to convert limp-leg attempts into back takes.

  - standup/single-to-back
  - standup/duck-under-from-single


### 7.9 Limp-Leg Solution for Height Disparity (Two-on-One Foot)

- Key concepts
  - When there is a significant height/arm-length difference, duck-under to the hip may not be realistic; instead, you use a two-on-one foot control.
  - Two hands on the foot (shoelace grip) create a surprisingly strong anchor that is hard to kick out of and can be redirected toward either hip.

- Position / structure
  - As the opponent turns and posts to limp-leg, switch from locked hands to a two-on-one grip on the foot/ankle (shoelaces, thumbs together, no thumb wrap).
  - If he turns away, pull the foot toward his far hip and run him down into a backside double or hip ride.
  - If he turns toward you, pull the foot toward the near hip and transition into closed double or finishing sequence in front.

- Key cues
  - “If you can’t reach his hip, own his foot.”
  - “Two hands on the shoelaces beats his kick-out.”
  - “Foot to the hip you want, then connect to legs or waist.”

- Drills & games
  - Height-mismatch rounds: taller partner uses limp-leg; shorter partner must use two-on-one foot solution and convert to double/hip control.
  - Direction-read drill: partner alternates between turning in and turning away; you must route the foot to the appropriate hip and finish.

  - standup/limp-leg-tall-opponent
  - standup/single-to-double-conversions


### 7.10 Managing Opponent’s Base from Single / High Leg

- Key concepts
  - Static high-leg or single-leg holds burn your energy while the opponent relaxes and balances; you must keep him moving to equalise or exceed his work rate.
  - Movement prescription: walk him forward, backward, and in circles; add obstructions and shoulder pressure to compromise his base.

- Position / structure
  - From elbow-deep single or high single, maintain good stance (knees bent, hips under, head in); do not stand upright.
  - Walk into him, then back, then circle both directions, always maintaining control of the leg.
  - Use your own foot as a physical obstacle behind his base leg to force hops; add inside/outside shoulder pressure to threaten hand or hip to the mat.

- Key cues
  - “If he’s comfortable, you’re doing it wrong.”
  - “Walk him, circle him, make him step over your foot.”
  - “Shoulder to hand, shoulder to hip: he should constantly feel like he’s about to fall.”

- Drills & games
  - “Make him work” rounds: your goal is not to finish but to keep opponent off-balance and working hard for 20–30 seconds from single/high leg.
  - Layered drill: phase 1 walk/circle; phase 2 add foot obstacles; phase 3 add alternating shoulder pressure to threaten posts and hip touches.

  - standup/high-leg-mobility


### 7.11 Stance Integrity in Single-Leg: Square vs Staggered

- Key concepts
  - Two main stance philosophies for holding single legs:
    - Staggered stance (wrestling-style): better mobility, easier to walk and circle.
    - Square, pigeon-toed stance with knees pinching: better foot control and wizard suppression, but less mobile.
  - No stance is “perfect”; each has vulnerabilities (wizard depth, guillotine risk, mobility vs control trade-offs).

- Position / structure
  - Staggered stance: side-on body, ear more on chest, easier to move but invites deeper whizzers and some counter throws if posture slips.
  - Square stance: forehead in the opponent’s chest/pectoral, knees pinching around the leg, elbows deep and locked, making strong whizzers and limp-leg escapes harder.
  - Forehead-on-chest square stance is emphasised when dealing with powerful whizzers; combine with bent knees and tight pinch to secure the leg.

- Key cues
  - “Staggered to move, square to clamp.”
  - “Forehead in his chest kills the deep whizzer.”
  - “Knees pinched, elbows deep; make limp-leg and wizard both hard.”

- Drills & games
  - Stance-swap drill: from live single-leg exchanges, deliberately alternate between staggered (to move) and square (to clamp) and feel when each is appropriate.
  - Wizard-pressure rounds: partner’s job is to apply and exploit strong whizzers; your job is to adopt forehead-on-chest, square stance and maintain structural integrity while hunting finishes.
