# VIEWING NOTES – Standing to Ground 1: Takedowns and Standing Skills

## 6.0 Volume 6 — Single-Leg Finishes: Cutbacks, Pipe & Double Transitions

### 6.1 Single Leg Finishes With One Leg – Kneeling Cutback

- Key concepts
  - Three global finish directions from single leg: finish quickly on the leg you have, switch to double leg, or raise the leg high.
  - Kneeling cutback is the primary “quick finish with one leg” and the first finish you should own from the single.
  - Takedown training must include managing real sprawl weight; most jiu-jitsu rooms drill entries against a compliant, weightless partner, which leaves athletes unprepared.

- Position / structure
  - Start from a rear-hand reach to the back leg, locking a standard single with chest close and head glued into the ribs/hip line, not hanging off the side.
  - Drop to both knees in a controlled way with hips under you, never collapsing to your butt or reaching backwards with your base.
  - Head drives into opponent so their weight shifts to the heel of the standing leg as you angle off and knee-slide.

- Key cues
  - “Back leg, rear-hand reach, then head pressure to the heel.”
  - “Carry his weight, don’t panic under the sprawl.”
  - “Knees under you, no sitting on your ass; slide, don’t flop.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Progressive resistance single-leg entries where partner lightly hips in and takes feet back so you must support realistic bodyweight before hitting the kneeling cutback.
  - Reps specifically on the knee-slide finish: start already in single-leg, partner gives fixed sprawl pressure, you only focus on angle change and knee slide to mat.
  - Technical sparring: “single-leg only” rounds where any time you get the leg, you must attempt an immediate kneeling cutback before switching to other finishes.

### 6.2 Standing Cutback

- Key concepts
  - Standing cutback is the same basic idea as the kneeling version (pulling the leg across your body to topple the opponent) but performed without dropping to both knees.
  - It offers faster, more mobile finishes when you do not want to commit your own knees to the mat or when entries start from higher stances.

- Position / structure
  - Begin from a strong single-leg position with the leg between your legs, chest tall and head tight to the ribs.
  - Step your outside leg across and behind the opponent’s standing leg while rotating their captured leg across your body, not between your legs.
  - Use your head and shoulder as a lever into their hip while your stepping motion makes their base narrow and unstable.

- Key cues
  - “Same cutback, but stay tall.”
  - “Leg across your body, not between your legs.”
  - “Step behind his heel as your head drives his hips over it.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Shadow reps of the stepping path for standing cutback (no partner) to ingrain footwork without worrying about grips.
  - Partner drill: start with a static single leg, perform standing cutback on signal, then reset; focus on timing the head drive with the step.
  - Constraint sparring: from live pummeling, first clean single wins the right to immediately attempt a standing cutback; partner’s goal is to balance and limp-leg out.

### 6.3 Tight Waist Cutback

- Key concepts
  - Tight waist cutback blends single-leg control with a waist lock, using trunk connection rather than just arm strength around the leg.
  - It’s especially relevant when the opponent sprawls hard, whizzers, or tries to square back to you; you pivot around the leg into a partial body lock and then cut them back.

- Position / structure
  - Maintain connection to the captured leg while wrapping a tight waist on the far side, gluing your chest to their hip line.
  - Head drives in under their armpit or along the ribs, turning their spine while your hip line sits close to the standing leg.
  - The finish is a rotational drop or knee slide where your trunk connection does the work, not a loose pull on the leg.

- Key cues
  - “Leg and waist as one unit.”
  - “Chest glued to the hip, not drifting away.”
  - “Rotate his hips over the trapped leg, not just yanking the leg.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Positional drill: partner starts with heavy whizzer and partial sprawl, you must transition to a tight waist plus single and finish with a cutback.
  - Flow drill: single → tight waist cutback → come up to top and hold for 3 seconds → let partner build to base → repeat.
  - Isolation rounds where your only finishes from single are kneeling cutback, standing cutback, or tight waist cutback, rotating through all three.

### 6.4 Running the Pipe / Dump

- Key concepts
  - Running the pipe is the primary “leg-between-your-legs” single-leg finish; mechanically distinct from cutbacks, which drag the leg across your body.
  - Connection quality dictates viability: paradoxically, a tight whizzer makes running the pipe easier because their frame becomes a handle that amplifies rotation.
  - Poor connection (loose whizzer, posts on your neck) makes running the pipe weaker and increases the chance they hop, slip the leg, or counter.

- Position / structure
  - Leg is between your legs with your shoulder heavy over their thigh and your hands gripping low near the ankle/heel.
  - Your stance is offset, with your outside leg stepping away as you rotate, so their captured leg is pivoting between your legs.
  - You rotate your torso and drop your level in a small arc, turning their knee and hip inward as their base collapses.

- Key cues
  - “Tight whizzer? Perfect, use it.”
  - “Leg between your legs for pipe, across for cutback.”
  - “Turn his knee like a steering wheel while your shoulder sinks.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Static balance drill: partner gives a tight whizzer and posts; your goal is to repeatedly run the pipe, focusing on rotation, not pulling.
  - Choice drill: from single-leg with live resistance, you must decide in real time whether to run the pipe (tight whizzer) or switch to a cutback (loose whizzer) based on feel.
  - “Pipe only” finishing rounds from pre-caught single-leg; partner aims to balance, hop, or limp-leg; you can only win via a clean dump.

### 6.5 Thigh Pry

- Key concepts
  - Thigh pry uses your shoulder and upper body as a wedge behind the opponent’s thigh to force their knees together and collapse their base.
  - It works both from classical single-leg position and later from high-leg situations in later volumes; here the emphasis is thigh pry from the leg between your legs.

- Position / structure
  - Shoulder wedges behind the opponent’s hamstring, with your grip locking above the knee line, never on the calf.
  - As you circle away from the captured leg, your shoulder pressure straightens and joins their legs, forcing hands to the mat.
  - Your hips stay close, driving in so that their knees are loaded and can be walked down to the floor.

- Key cues
  - “Shoulder behind hamstring, hands above the knee.”
  - “Circle away to straighten and join his legs.”
  - “Drive until knees and then hands hit the mat.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Technical sequence: single-leg catch → shoulder slides behind thigh → circle and pry until both knees touch → hold top for 3 seconds.
  - Partner feedback drill focusing on feel: partner calls out “more shoulder” or “more circle” based on whether they feel pressure or just pulling.
  - Combination drill: run the pipe attempt that fails into immediate thigh pry when you feel his legs almost join.

  - standup/thigh-pry

### 6.6 Foot Trip

- Key concepts
  - Foot trip turns the opponent’s hopping defence into a liability by taking out their base leg at the moment they shift weight.
  - It is a controlled, low-amplitude trip, not a wild soccer kick; safety and precision are emphasised.

- Position / structure
  - Maintain a tight single-leg harness with chest and head controlling the hip line; free foot targets the heel or ankle of the standing leg.
  - Your upper body should already be off-balancing the opponent so that the trip only has to remove a weakened base.
  - Trip direction matches the line along which you’re already rotating or pulling, so the fall is smooth and predictable.

- Key cues
  - “Off-balance first, then touch the foot.”
  - “Small hook or block, not a big kick.”
  - “Trip in the same direction you’re already turning him.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Cooperative drill: partner hops to maintain balance; you time light foot trips as they load the leg, focusing on timing rather than power.
  - Safety drill: practice the same trip slowly with explicit falling mechanics for the partner (knees pointing away, controlled hands to mat).
  - Chain drill: single-leg → running the pipe attempt → if he hops and recovers, flow straight to a foot trip in the same direction.

  - standup/foot-sweeps

### 6.7 Back Side Finish

- Key concepts
  - Back side finish is the first explicit move away from front-facing single-leg control to back exposure around the hips.
  - Once you are backside on the hips, the opponent’s sprawl and turn-to-face options are dramatically reduced; your job is to maintain leg control while rotating around.

- Position / structure
  - Start from a single on the rear leg; as they sprawl and turn, you pivot around the leg so you are beside or behind their hips.
  - Your chest is oriented toward their glutes/hamstrings, and your grips lock above the knee line on both legs or on the primary leg plus the far hip.
  - You drive or walk them down so their hands and then knees hit the mat, arriving with chest over hips rather than letting them roll into guard.

- Key cues
  - “Use his sprawl to turn the corner.”
  - “Stay glued to the hips as you move backside.”
  - “Hands, then knees, then you cover the hips.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Positional rounds starting in a compromised single with partner already sprawling; your score condition is to get backside and hold 3 seconds.
  - Movement drill where you walk a partner’s leg in a circle from front single positions to clear backside angles without finishing, just to train path.
  - Integration drill: kneeling cutback and running the pipe as Plan A; when they spin hard to avoid them, you follow to a backside finish.

  - standup/back-exposure

### 6.8 Single Leg to Double Leg – Far Side Finish

- Key concepts
  - Single leg is treated as an “anchor” or foot in the door; the main job is to connect you to the opponent so you can convert to easier double-leg finishes.
  - Far side finish targets the leg on the far side of your head, creating a reverse or backside double that is far harder to sprawl against and far easier to score from.

- Position / structure
  - Begin with a rear-leg single; as they sprawl and you rise, bring your hands down and aim your shoulder behind the hamstring of the far leg.
  - Without breaking your grip connection, you run around the corner until you can lock both legs above the knees from a backside angle.
  - Hips drive in as you push their hands to the mat and walk them down into a broken-down position.

- Key cues
  - “Single is the anchor, double is the kill.”
  - “Shoulder behind the far hamstring, then run.”
  - “Reverse double is easier than front double; take the backside when it’s there.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Step-by-step drill: rear-leg single → feel sprawl → drop arms and shoulder behind far hamstring → run to far side double → finish.
  - Cue-based drill where partner calls “front” or “back” mid-defence; on “back,” you must convert to far side/backside double rather than finishing in front.
  - Sparring constraint: from live standing, any time you secure a single you must attempt at least one far side single-to-double conversion before switching to another finish or disengaging.

  - standup/single-leg
  - standup/double-leg
  - standup/backside-double

---

### 6.9 Near Side Finish

- Key concepts
  - Near side finish collects the leg on the same side as your head when far side access is blocked or when the opponent’s turn directs their base that way.
  - The same single-as-anchor logic applies: you keep continuous contact with one leg while stepping to a configuration where both knees can be controlled.

- Position / structure
  - From a single with heavy sprawl pressure, step your outside leg to the near side and swing your torso so that both of their knees are accessible in front of you.
  - Hands connect just above both knees, and your head position supports their hip line rather than collapsing forward.
  - You walk through their base, taking their knees away from their shoulders so the upper body is forced down.

- Key cues
  - “If far leg is blocked, collect the near one.”
  - “Anchor on one leg as you move to both.”
  - “Walk through his base; don’t just pull.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Choice drill: partner can hide either far or near leg as you attack from single; you must read which knee is available and finish to that side.
  - Slow-motion walk-through drill focused only on the knee-collecting step and the direction of your walk, not speed or impact.
  - Combination drill: failed far side attempt that immediately re-tracks to a near side finish when the opponent turns back into you.

### 6.10 Barzegar Finish

- Key concepts
  - Barzegar finish is a classic single-to-double dynamic where you use the single leg to open a path to both knees with a strong rotational drop.
  - It rewards good timing as the opponent tries to square and pull the leg back, turning their recovery into momentum for your finish.

- Position / structure
  - From a single, step your body to a side where you can see and access both knees while keeping the leg elevated.
  - As you turn, your hands drop to a deep grip above both knees and your chest aims toward the belt line, not over the top of their shoulders.
  - The finish is a rotational run that tilts their shoulders behind their hips, forcing them to fall in the direction of your turn.

- Key cues
  - “Use his square-up as your turn.”
  - “Hands deep above the knees, chest to the belt.”
  - “Put his shoulders behind his hips; they can’t stand there.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Timing drill: partner repeatedly tries to square and pull the leg out from your single; you must hit the Barzegar as they initiate the square.
  - Technical repetitions focusing on the path of your turn (no finish) so you learn exactly where both knees should be when you commit.
  - Transition drill linking Barzegar with far side and near side finishes so you always have a rotational option, not just straight-line doubles.

### 6.11 Drop Double

- Key concepts
  - Drop double returns to a more classical knee-based double leg, now built on the prior work with single and high doubles.
  - It is used when the opponent’s reactions pull you lower and closer to the legs, making a level change to the knees the most efficient path.

- Position / structure
  - From a single or loose double, you drop your weight to your knees with a straight back, head tight, and hands driving behind the knees.
  - Your penetration step and knee drop must land you under their center of mass, not reaching out with extended arms.
  - The finish drives through, taking their knees out from under them while your chest rises into their hips.

- Key cues
  - “Drop under, don’t reach out.”
  - “Knees under his center, head tight.”
  - “Drive through until his knees and then hips leave the line.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Penetration-shot-only drill: start just out of range and practice entering to perfect drop-double position without actually finishing.
  - Integration drill where single- and high-double attempts, when stuffed high, automatically convert to a drop double on the re-shot.
  - Positional sparring starting with you already in a good drop-double position; partner’s job is to sprawl and angle out, yours is to complete cleanly.

### 6.12 Back Side Double

- Key concepts
  - Back side double (reverse double) is presented as the most forgiving finishing environment once you have initial leg control.
  - From behind the hips, opponent cannot meaningfully sprawl or easily turn to face you; any strong effort tends to put their hands on the mat and their knees together.

- Position / structure
  - Use the single leg as an anchor and run your feet to the back side until both of their legs are captured above the knees with you behind or slightly to the side of the hips.
  - Shoulder sits behind their hamstrings, chest aligned with the belt line, and hands locked just above the knees to prevent any meaningful step-out.
  - Finish by driving and walking until their hands and then knees touch, landing in a dominant top position with your body over their hips.

- Key cues
  - “Any time you can get backside double, take it; it’s money in the bank.”
  - “Anchor on the first leg, then run behind both.”
  - “Control above the knees, shoulder behind the hamstrings, hands and knees to the mat.”

- Drills / training ideas
  - Conversion drill: from every single-leg finish covered in this volume, flow into a backside double whenever the opponent over-rotates to defend.
  - Positional rounds starting with you already on a backside double; partner’s only task is to stand or turn, yours is to keep them broken down and score.
  - Mapping drill: draw the three global finishing paths (quick finish on one leg, convert to double, raise to high leg) and explicitly map which sequences in this volume link to backside double so it sits clearly at the end of your finishing tree.
