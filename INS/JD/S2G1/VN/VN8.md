# VIEWING NOTES – Standing2Ground: Takedowns and Standing Skills

## 8.0 Volume 8 — Body Locks & Leg-to-Torso Transitions

### 8.1 Why Body Locks Matter For Jiu-Jitsu

- **Key concepts**
  - Body locks are presented as the highest-percentage way to bridge leg attacks and scoring upper-body takedowns in no-gi jiu-jitsu.
  - Working between knees and waist avoids many of the control problems of naked feet and lower-leg attacks.
  - Upper-body finishes from body locks naturally create back exposure opportunities and more stable ground control than most leg tackles.
  - Scoring priority: back exposure and stable chest-to-chest/back contact are worth more than raw “amplitude” on takedowns.

- **Position–structure**
  - Preferred working zone is from knees to waist, not ankle/foot.
  - Chest-to-chest and chest-to-back contacts are treated as the premium control shells on the feet.
  - Frame: upright torso, strong base, no over-extension of chest past feet.

- **Key cues**
  - “Back beats takedown” – if you can convert takedown attempts into back exposure, do it.
  - “Work the waist, not the feet” when submission risk around legs is high.
  - Think of body lock as the natural “next floor up” after leg tackles.

- **Drills & games**
  - Positional sparring: start from neutral, mandate that every successful takedown must pass through a standing body lock.
  - Constraint rounds: no finishes from below the knee; all scores must come from body locks or back exposure.

### 8.2 Entry Pattern: From Leg Tackles To Body Locks

- **Key concepts**
  - In modern jiu-jitsu stances, the main route to body locks is: attack legs (single/double/high crotch) → opponent pulls you up or you climb to the waist → secure body lock.
  - This pattern works from both knee-based shots and standing entries.
  - The leg attack is treated as a “conduit” rather than the final objective.

- **Position–structure**
  - Start in solid stance, shoot or step to front-leg tackles.
  - As opponent defends by pulling legs back and lifting posture, you rise with them and transition hands from legs to waist.
  - Finish in either hips-in-front or hips-behind body lock structure (chosen contextually).

- **Key cues**
  - “Failed shot is not a failure if you arrive at the waist.”
  - As you feel yourself being dragged up, think “lock the waist” instead of bailing out.
  - Hands climb: ankle/knee → thigh/hip → clasp behind waist.

- **Drills & games**
  - Reps: double-leg to “failed finish” → immediate waist climb → secure body lock, no actual takedown.
  - Situational: partner instructed to always drag you up from shots; your job is to secure body lock within 1–2 beats.

### 8.3 Hip Jousting: In Front, Behind, Height And Proximity

- **Key concepts**
  - Fundamental choice in body locks: operate with hips in front of opponent’s hips or behind them.
  - Hip height and proximity determine who can lift or throw whom; tall, distant hips are punished.
  - “Hip jousting” is constant negotiation: below his hips and under his center wins; tall or behind-without-support loses.

- **Position–structure**
  - Hips in front: aim to get your hips under opponent’s center of gravity for lifts and forward drives.
  - Hips behind: thigh sits on line between opponent’s buttocks and hamstrings to push them over an invisible “ledge.”
  - Proximity: hips pressed in; minimal gap to avoid uchi-mata/harai-goshi style entries.

- **Key cues**
  - “Lower hips win” – constantly seeking to have your hips under theirs.
  - If your hips drift back while he has a whizzer, expect big forward throws.
  - If you go behind, make sure your thigh is glued behind his legs; if you go in front, drive hips under and forward.

- **Drills & games**
  - Static drill: partner and you hold body lock; call “front/behind/switch” to alternate hip positions and feel balance changes.
  - Dynamic: light resistance rounds where the only objective is off-balancing via hip height and thigh placement, no takedown completion.

### 8.4 Shoulders, Hips And Lock Height (Chest-To-Chest vs Shoulder-To-Chest)

- **Key concepts**
  - Control comes from managing the relationship between opponent’s shoulders and hips: you want shoulders past hips in the “bad” direction for them.
  - With hips behind: get their shoulders behind their hips to break posture and balance.
  - With hips in front: push their shoulders forward over their hips to topple them.

- **Position–structure**
  - Chest-to-chest vs shoulder-to-chest body lock:
    - Chest-to-chest often uses a lower lock around the lumbar region for maximum hip/torso control.
    - Shoulder-to-chest angles help twist them and create shoulder-behind-hip situations.
  - Lock height:
    - High lock = less control of hips, more exposure to being arched/tilted.
    - Low lock (lumbar) = better ability to stop hips receding and to tilt shoulders past hips.

- **Key cues**
  - “Shoulders behind hips, they fall; shoulders ahead, they can throw.”
  - “Lock lower than his lock” if both of you are body-locked.
  - Chin below opponent’s shoulder, not over the top, to maintain leverage and avoid being tilted.

- **Drills & games**
  - Partner offers different body lock configurations; you must adjust lock height and head position to either put their shoulders behind hips or forward over hips.
  - Slow-motion walks in a circle from body lock, focusing only on shoulder–hip line changes, no throws.

### 8.5 Chest-To-Chest Body Lock Mechanics And Safety vs Uchi-Mata

- **Key concepts**
  - Chest-to-chest body locks must neutralise classic judo counters (uchi-mata, harai-goshi) which punish sloppy hip position.
  - Bringing hips in and down, with upright posture, blunts lifting counters and keeps you in control.
  - Goal is to be grounded on two strong feet, not precariously leaned or on one leg against their throw.

- **Position–structure**
  - Upright torso, forehead or firm head contact into opponent’s chest (not ear-on-chest).
  - Hips under theirs, knees bent, feet “biting” the mat.
  - Lock snug around lumbar; no daylight between hips.

- **Key cues**
  - “No tall hips, no bent-over hugging.”
  - If he steps his hips in front with low hips, immediately respond by lowering and re-centering your hips under his.
  - Feel for situations where you are light on one leg with his hips under you – abort and re-set hip position.

- **Drills & games**
  - Uchi-mata counter drill: partner tries to step in and lift; your job is to continuously adjust hips and lock to deny lift and re-balance them.
  - “No throw allowed” rounds where uke’s goal is to throw from overhook/whizzer; tori’s goal is to maintain safe chest-to-chest body lock structure.

### 8.6 Power Twist (Uki-Goshi) From Body Lock

- **Key concepts**
  - First recommended takedown from body lock is a half-hip “power twist” (uki-goshi) rather than simple calf-to-calf trips.
  - Many jiu-jitsu players instinctively step behind and hook calf-to-calf, which loads them onto strong uchi-mata counters.
  - The twist uses partial hip insertion plus circular movement rather than big, exposing steps.

- **Position–structure**
  - From chest-to-chest body lock with hips in front, step between or slightly across opponent’s legs.
  - Insert your hip partially across theirs (half-hip) so their weight comes towards your hip.
  - Maintain tight waist lock and upright posture as you rotate them over the hip.

- **Key cues**
  - “Don’t offer them a free uchi-mata platform” – avoid exaggerated step-behind-and-hook as first option.
  - Think “block and turn” rather than “hook and hope.”
  - Keep hips low and under; twist them over, not yourself under.

- **Drills & games**
  - Controlled power twist reps from static chest-to-chest body lock, focusing on small hip insertion and circular footwork.
  - Comparison drill: do a few calf-to-calf trips, feel exposure; then same entry with more conservative half-hip block and twist.

  - [SYS] Standup/Takedowns – Low-Amplitude Hip Throws


### 8.7 Walking Circle And The Back-Exposure Dilemma

- **Key concepts**
  - The power twist is relatively slow and controlling, giving opponent time to react with hands to the mat to save points.
  - That reaction creates a dilemma: keep whizzer and get thrown to back, or post hands and expose back for hooks.
  - Ideal takedowns either score directly or force back exposure when opponent tries to deny the score.

- **Position–structure**
  - From body lock, step between legs and begin walking a tight circle so their base is driven into “no-man’s land.”
  - Maintain hip-under-hip shape and tight lumbar lock while rotating.
  - As they fall and/or reach to the mat, follow to half guard/side control or climb to back as appropriate.

- **Key cues**
  - “Walk him where he has no base, not straight through his strongest post.”
  - Watch the whizzer: if he holds tight, keep turning and commit to the throw; if he releases to post, immediately chase back exposure.
  - Think in terms of scoring dilemma rather than a single, rigid finish.

- **Drills & games**
  - Dilemma rounds: partner chooses randomly to keep whizzer or post hands; you must either finish to back-flat pin or transition to back control.
  - Circuit: body lock → circle walk → finish to half guard pin, repeating both sides.

  - [SYS] Standup/Body Lock – Circle Walk


### 8.8 Knee-Drop Body Lock Finish

- **Key concepts**
  - Knee-drop finishes emphasise low amplitude, high control: put opponent down in a way that pins them long enough to score.
  - Dropping to one or two knees with hips still above theirs keeps you winning the scramble phase after impact.
  - This contrasts with big, bouncing throws that may look impressive but allow quick stand-ups.

- **Position–structure**
  - From strong chest-to-chest lock and broken balance, step and turn so their feet begin to leave the floor.
  - As their weight comes off base, drop one or both knees behind or beside them while maintaining tight waist connection.
  - Head stays driving into chest; hips stay higher than theirs as you land.

- **Key cues**
  - “Hips higher than theirs even on your knees.”
  - Elbow mechanics: one elbow down, one elbow up to twist and topple them.
  - No gap on the way down; you ride them to the floor, don’t “let go and hope.”

- **Drills & games**
  - Partner-feel drill: slow knee-drop entries where uke focuses on trying to scramble up; tori prioritises staying glued and pinning.
  - Linked drill: failed single → climb to body lock → immediate knee-drop finish in one smooth chain.

  - [SYS] Standup/Takedowns – Control-Oriented Finishes


### 8.9 Rotational Block And Near-Foot Turn

- **Key concepts**
  - Rotational body lock finish that blocks the near foot instead of big back-step entries.
  - Focus is on rotating opponent’s support foot off the mat and dropping them with shoulders behind hips.
  - This is another low-amplitude, high-control option that ends with you kneeling above their hips.

- **Position–structure**
  - From body lock, step across and place your foot as a block near their support foot rather than stepping fully behind.
  - Initiate a tight rotational pull that turns their body over the blocked foot.
  - Drop to a knee as they rotate, maintaining hip height and head/torso connection.

- **Key cues**
  - “Block, then rotate, then drop” – in that order.
  - Don’t try to lift; think about taking the support foot away via rotation.
  - As they start to twist over the block, your job is to kneel into the space where their hips used to be.

- **Drills & games**
  - Technical reps: body lock → step-across block → small rotational turn → controlled knee drop.
  - Isolation sparring: start in body lock; tori can only use rotational block finish, uke resists realistically.

  - [SYS] Standup/Takedowns – Near-Foot Blocks


### 8.10 Lift-And-Knee-Sweep Body Lock Finish

- **Key concepts**
  - Signature finish: lift from body lock, then use your own knee to sweep opponent’s legs for a controlled descent into side control or strong pin.
  - Requires brief one-leg balance on your part, but executed with structure rather than brute strength.
  - Designed to land you immediately in a dominant passing position, not just open ground.

- **Position–structure**
  - From tight body lock, step towards opponent and load their weight onto your hips.
  - As you lift, bring your knee in to clear or “sweep” their legs out of the way so they cannot base.
  - You land across their torso with chest pressure, hips heavy, often dropping into cross side or strong half-guard top.

- **Key cues**
  - “Step, lift, knee-sweep, settle” – no pause between phases.
  - Keep torso upright; if you lean, you become throw-able.
  - Think of your knee as the last barrier their legs must cross before hitting the mat.

- **Drills & games**
  - Partner-assisted lift drill: focus on timing and structure; partner helps by jumping slightly to reduce load while you refine mechanics.
  - Full chain: failed single → climb to body lock → lift-and-knee-sweep finish → immediate pin stabilization count.
