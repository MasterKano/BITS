# VIEWING NOTES – Standing to Ground 1: Takedowns and Standing Skills

## 3.0 Volume 3 — Snapdowns & Four-Phase Front Takedown Model

### 3.1 Special Study: Snapdown as the Jab of Standing Grappling – Purpose

- Key concepts
  - Snapdown is the jab-equivalent of standing grappling: a high-frequency, low-commitment, multi-tasking tool that sets up most meaningful offence from the feet.
  - Core objective is to break the opponent’s stance; as long as stance is intact, offence and defence are strong, once stance breaks, both deteriorate.
  - Every snapdown must have a clear purpose: force steps, bring hands to the mat, create straightening, force reaching, induce fatigue, or reset bad ties; “tugging on the head for no reason” is explicitly rejected.

- Position / structure
  - Begin from controlled ties and forehead-to-head contact rather than from long-range dives at the neck.
  - Use hands, forearms, head and legs together; spine stays organised and you vacate the space you’re snapping them into.
  - Aim to move their centre of gravity toward and beyond the edge of their base, not just bend their neck.

- Key cues
  - “Snapdown is the jab of standup.”
  - “Break stance, don’t just pull heads.”
  - “Never snap without a clearly chosen purpose.”

- Drills & games
  - Purpose-call drill: partner snaps, then immediately calls which purpose they were chasing (step, hands-to-mat, straightening, reach, fatigue, reset).
  - Film review audit: tag each snap in footage with its achieved purpose; unlabelled snaps are treated as errors.

- System tags
  - standup/snapdown-core
  - standup/stance-breaking
  - standup/hand-fight-goals


### 3.2 Mechanics of the Snapdown

- Key concepts
  - Mechanical core: pull perpendicular to the opponent’s toe line while their chest is threatening to go past their base of support.
  - Two ways to get the right line: move them (make them step forward/back or turn) or move yourself (pivot off-line) so the pull is perpendicular to the new toe line.
  - True snap is kinetic, not a static pull: you briefly create space between hands and head/arm, then strike back into that space.

- Position / structure
  - Study the relationship between their centre of gravity and the toe line; snap is timed when chest approaches or crosses that line.
  - Hands and wrists often push slightly past head/arm first, then rebound; palms and fingers are not constantly clamped.
  - Head and legs participate: you step out of the way while your head drops, snapping them into the space you vacate, not onto your own legs.

- Key cues
  - “Pull perpendicular to the toe line.”
  - “Move him or move yourself, then snap.”
  - “Create space, then hit the snap into that space.”
  - “Step out, head down, snap into the empty space in front of you.”

- Drills & games
  - Toe-line drill: partner holds various stances; player identifies toe line, then practises moving self or opponent to hit perpendicular snaps.
  - Kinetic snap drill: alternate slow pulls vs true snaps with space between hands and head/arm; partner gives feedback on which actually move them.

- System tags
  - standup/snapdown-mechanics
  - standup/stance-geometry
  - standup/head-legs-coordination


### 3.3 Rear Hand Snap

- Key concepts
  - Simplest low-risk snapdown and the first he teaches; main job is to make the opponent take a step toward you and start stance breaking.
  - Uses rear hand post on shoulder or head, then short push–pull to draw the near or far leg forward.
  - Designed to be quick and transient, not a long-held collar tie.

- Position / structure
  - Same-side stance; rear hand posts on shoulder or head, lead hand protects legs.
  - Small push from the post, then quick recoil into a snap that brings their foot toward you.
  - Often used without stepping yourself; minimal commitment.

- Key cues
  - “Lead hand covers, rear hand reaches.”
  - “Post, jolt, then snap a step out of them.”
  - “Just enough contact to make the leg step.”

- Drills & games
  - Step-calling drill: player calls which leg they want; must elicit that specific step within one or two rear-hand snaps.
  - Distance-control rounds: only rear-hand snaps allowed, no shots; aim is to shorten distance to a chosen leg.

- System tags
  - standup/snapdown-variants
  - standup/stance-manipulation
  - standup/front-leg-exposure


### 3.4 Lead Hand Snap

- Key concepts
  - Lead-hand reaching is riskier but acceptable when done with tight defensive awareness and angle change.
  - Primary job is still to force steps and start turning the opponent, not to yank them down in place.

- Position / structure
  - Lead hand reaches to head with head level matched; rear hand defends shot lane.
  - As soon as contact is made, you pivot off-line; never freeze with extended arm directly in front.
  - Contact on the head is brief; grip is not held for a long collar-tie wrestle.

- Key cues
  - “If the lead hand reaches, the feet must move.”
  - “Touch and turn, don’t touch and park.”
  - “Contact is a spark, not an anchor.”

- Drills & games
  - Touch-and-pivot drill: players must angle off immediately on every lead-hand head touch; coach punishes straight-line reaches with fake shots.
  - Lead-hand snap ladder: build sequences of 2–3 snaps that progressively move the opponent around the mat.

- System tags

  - standup/snapdown-variants
  - standup/angle-step


### 3.5 Multi-Snap

- Key concepts
  - Multi-snap combines rear and lead hand snaps in sequence to fatigue the opponent and drive hands toward the floor.
  - Used to accumulate stance damage and provoke strong pull-back reactions that open shots.

- Position / structure
  - Begin with rear-hand post and snap; follow with alternating hand snaps as you walk them.
  - Each snap is modest in isolation but cumulatively drags head and spine repeatedly.
  - Opponent response tends to oscillate between dropping hands and violently straightening.

- Key cues
  - “One snap rarely breaks a stance; a series does.”
  - “Multi-snap to tire the back and slow the reactions.”
  - “Use their pull-back to open leg entries.”

- Drills & games
  - Time-based pump-snap rounds: 15–30 seconds of continuous multi-snaps, then immediate entry drill to doubles/singles off the pull-back.
  - Fatigue-test sparring: mix multi-snaps into normal standup rounds, tracking when opponent’s stance height increases over time.

- System tags
  - standup/stance-fatigue
  - standup/snapdown-chains
  - standup/setup-to-shot-timing


### 3.6 Head Pass Snap

- Key concepts
  - Combines pull and push: start with downwards snaps, then push and “pass” the head across to create a strong attacking angle.
  - Converts linear stance-breaking into angular opportunity for leg attacks.

- Position / structure
  - Begin with collar/head control; pull to bend and load the stance.
  - Transition to a push on the head, guiding it across your centreline while stepping and turning.
  - Resulting position: clear angle off their shoulder with head outside their elbow line.

- Key cues
  - “Pull to bend, push to angle.”
  - “Snap their head down, then pass it across.”
  - “Turn their head like a steering wheel to open the lane.”

- Drills & games
  - Pull–push flow: repeated sequences of two snaps followed by a head pass into an entry position, with light resistance.
  - Angle-only game: players can only win the exchange by achieving the head-pass angle; no shots allowed until angle is secured.

- System tags
  - standup/head-pass-series
  - standup/angle-creation
  - standup/snap-to-shot


### 3.7 Collar and Tricep Snap

- Key concepts
  - First two-handed snap he teaches; important for creating stronger downward force and reliable hands-to-mat reactions.
  - Built around the common reaction where the opponent grabs your tricep after a collar tie.

- Position / structure
  - Start from collar tie; opponent takes tricep control.
  - You swim over their tricep and either control wrist or shoulder, giving collar-and-tricep configuration.
  - Use forearms and head to push, then step and snap them past you into the newly vacated space, bringing hands to floor.

- Key cues
  - “When they grab your tricep, upgrade to collar-and-tricep.”
  - “Push with forearms, then step out and snap past your hip.”
  - “Vacate the space you snap them into.”

- Drills & games
  - Reaction drill: partner is instructed to grab tricep every time you collar-tie; you must immediately convert to collar-and-tricep snap.
  - Directional snaps: practise snapping them forward, sideways and slightly behind, always vacating the space first.

- System tags
  - standup/two-hand-snap-series
  - standup/hands-to-mat
  - standup/front-headlock-entries


### 3.8 Collar and Forearm Snap

- Key concepts
  - Solution for when they collar-tie your head; you use their own collar tie and forearm as the snapping lever.
  - Power comes mainly from the forearm grip, not the hand on the head.

- Position / structure
  - Opponent collar-ties your head; you collar-tie theirs and lay your forearm/wrist over their forearm.
  - As you circle and then step back, the hand on the forearm drives their hands toward the floor; the head grip only guides.
  - You snap them into the space you just vacated, ending with hands on mat and their posture broken.

- Key cues
  - “When they grab your head, you grab their forearm.”
  - “Snap with the forearm hand; head hand only steers.”
  - “Step back, chin to chest, bow them into the mat.”

- Drills & games
  - Collar-tie duel: partner must collar-tie you; your job is to convert to collar-and-forearm snap within 3–4 beats.
  - Snap-or-be-snapped drill: both athletes collar-tie and try to impose collar-and-forearm snaps; whoever wins the hands-to-mat moment scores.

- System tags
  - standup/opponent-collar-tie-responses
  - standup/snapdown-defense-to-offense
  - standup/front-headlock-hub


### 3.9 Overtie Snap

- Key concepts
  - Another answer to a strong collar-tie opponent; you overhook the tie (overtie) and snap via connecting their ear to their own bicep.
  - Especially favoured by Danaher; simple, powerful, and easy to learn.

- Position / structure
  - Opponent collar-ties; you wrap your arm over their tie (overtie) and clamp their ear toward their bicep.
  - Free hand controls wrist, elbow, or posts inside to prevent double grips.
  - Step back to square, chin to chest, then bow, using your whole body to walk their hands to the mat.

- Key cues
  - “Overtie connects ear to bicep.”
  - “Head down first, then bow; arm just guides.”
  - “Use body weight, not arm curl.”

- Drills & games
  - Overtie snap reps: repetitive entries from collar-tie to overtie, snapping hands to mat with maximum mechanics, minimum arm strength.
  - Collartie sparring: one partner’s only job is strong collar-ties; other must cycle between collar-and-forearm and overtie snaps.

- System tags
  - standup/overtie-series
  - standup/hands-to-mat
  - standup/head-heavy-strategy


### 3.10 Single and Double Tricep Snap

- Key concepts
  - Demonstrates that you can snap purely from tricep control without touching the head.
  - Inside control on the arms (elbows inside their elbows, cupping triceps with no thumb) gives strong snapping leverage.

- Position / structure
  - Inside tie position: your elbows inside theirs, hands cupping triceps high near the armpit (no thumbs).
  - Step off-line and drop your head while pulling triceps down and away into the space you vacate.
  - Can be done from single tricep or double tricep; head never needs to contact theirs.

- Key cues
  - “You don’t need the head; snap the arms.”
  - “Elbows inside, hands over triceps, no thumbs.”
  - “Step, head down, arms guide them into the floor.”

- Drills & games
  - Tricep-only snap drill: no head grips allowed; players must get hands-to-mat solely from tricep snaps.
  - Inside-control mini-game: once inside triceps is obtained, you get 3 seconds to attempt a snap, then reset.

- System tags
  - standup/tricep-control-series
  - standup/headless-snapdowns
  - standup/inside-control-offense


### 3.11 Pump Snap

- Key concepts
  - Purpose is cumulative fatigue, not immediate positional gain; used especially in long matches.
  - Repeated quick “pumps” of the head create spinal fatigue, dizziness and encourage the opponent to stand more upright over time.

- Position / structure
  - From head control, perform three quick mini-snaps (pump, pump, pump) then disengage or change phase.
  - You are not necessarily seeking hands-to-mat or angles; just stressing the long lever of the spine.
  - Over rounds, they respond by raising stance height, which opens legs for attacks.

- Key cues
  - “Pump to tire, not to score.”
  - “Three quick snaps, then out.”
  - “Fatigue the back, harvest the upright stance later.”

- Drills & games
  - Timed pump cycles: 3-pump sequences interspersed with neutral footwork; track opponent’s stance height changes over 10–12 minutes.
  - Long-round integration: mix pump snaps into normal standup sparring with an explicit goal of observing when opponent’s posture breaks late.

- System tags
  - standup/stance-fatigue-strategy
  - standup/long-match-tactics
  - standup/snapdown-conditioning


### 3.12 Underhook Snap

- Key concepts
  - Built from an underhook pulling grip; uses an underhook combined with a fake leg attack to create a big snap to hands-and-knees.
  - Shows how underhooks can be used offensively to snap, not only to throw or clinch.

- Position / structure
  - Start by creating an underhook via snap reaction: rear-hand snap separates elbow from torso, allowing entry.
  - Head goes into offensive position on underhook side; you drive, then fake a leg attack to make them resist.
  - As they resist and straighten, you drop and pull with the underhook hand, snapping them to hands and knee(s).

- Key cues
  - “Snap to underhook, fake shot, then pull everything into the floor.”
  - “Cut the shoulder for pulling, not just pushing.”
  - “Use their straighten-up reaction to finish the snap.”

- Drills & games
  - Underhook chain drill: rear-hand snap → underhook → fake shot → underhook snap to hands and knees.
  - Underhook-only rounds: once underhook is established, you must either snap to hands/knees or convert to a takedown; no neutral pummelling.

- System tags
  - standup/underhook-system
  - standup/underhook-snap-series
  - standup/snap-to-front-headlock


### 3.13 2-on-1 Snap

- Key concepts
  - Built off 2-on-1 (Russian) control; uses the arm as a post to staple their hand to the mat, then transitions to front headlock and further attacks.
  - Integrates arm-drag style entries with snapdown mechanics.

- Position / structure
  - From posts and arm contacts, you slide into 2-on-1 (classical or figure-four).
  - Shoulder drives into them; then you open your body and backstep, stapling their hand down to the mat.
  - Common follow-up: as they square, you climb to front headlock and continue snapping to elbows-and-knees.

- Key cues
  - “Two-on-one to staple, then headlock.”
  - “Drive first, then open and drop the arm.”
  - “Hand goes to mat, then head goes under attack.”

- Drills & games
  - 2-on-1 entry + snap drill: repeatedly enter 2-on-1, staple hand to mat, then transition to front headlock.
  - 2-on-1 positional sparring: starting from 2-on-1, score only if you can create hands-to-mat plus a subsequent head control.

- System tags
  - standup/two-on-one-system
  - standup/snapdown-from-arm-drag
  - standup/front-headlock-integration


### 3.14 Ko-Uchi Snap

- Key concepts
  - Ko-uchi gari used not as a finishing sweep but as a stance-breaker to initiate snapdowns, especially versus upright, guillotine-dangerous stances.
  - Crucial adaptation for jiu-jitsu where opponents are often tall and relaxed rather than bent over.

- Position / structure
  - From collar-and-bicep or similar tie, you attack their lead leg with a small inside foot reap using the sole of your foot at their ankle.
  - Purpose is to disturb stance, not to throw; as they react to the disturbance, you step back and snap them into the empty space.
  - Hands snap across your body, not into you; legs withdraw so they do not fall onto your thighs.

- Key cues
  - “Ko-uchi to break stance, snap to finish.”
  - “Reap to loosen the base, then snap into the gap.”
  - “Use the sole, not the shoelaces; disturb, don’t kill training partners.”

- Drills & games
  - Ko-uchi-to-snap drill: repeated entries where each ko-uchi must be followed immediately by a snap into the vacated space.
  - Upright-opponent games: partner forced to play upright; player must use ko-uchi snaps to get any hands-to-mat results.

- System tags
  - standup/ashi-waza-integration
  - standup/upright-stance-answers
  - standup/ko-uchi-snap-series


### 3.15 Front vs Rear Takedowns

- Key concepts
  - Sharp distinction between takedowns performed in front of the opponent vs from behind; rear takedowns are “ten times easier.”
  - Front takedowns expose you to sprawls, guillotines and many counters; rear takedowns greatly reduce available counters and submission threats.

- Position / structure
  - Front position: you drive into hips, facing their sprawl, hips, guillotines and upper-body defence.
  - Rear position: you are behind the hips; you can collapse them without fighting a full sprawl, and submissions are far rarer.
  - System design prefers any opportunity to move from front to rear to finish from behind.

- Key cues
  - “When in doubt, get behind.”
  - “Front takedowns are work; rear takedowns are profit.”
  - “If you can choose between front and back, choose back.”

- Drills & games
  - Choice rounds: whenever a front leg tackle stalls, players are rewarded more highly for transitions to rear takedowns than for forced front finishes.
  - Rear-finish focus: positional sparring starting from rear body lock, treating rear takedowns as a primary offensive hub.

- System tags
  - standup/front-vs-rear-takedowns
  - standup/back-priority
  - standup/transition-to-rear


### 3.16 Four-Phase Front-Leg Takedown Model – Phase 1: Setup

- Key concepts
  - Most front leg tackles follow four phases: setup, catch, connection, completion.
  - Setup must create a momentary advantage so speed is no longer the sole deciding factor; otherwise distance shots favour the faster athlete.
  - Preferred setups are those that break stance by: putting hands to mat, getting outside elbows, or creating a clear, unobstructed head-to-leg line.

- Position / structure
  - Neutral distance favours athleticism; setup creates structural asymmetry that favours skill and timing.
  - Micro-windows: kicks to stance (steps, squares, bends) that briefly open the fortress door.
  - Stance-breaking examples: square their feet, pull chest over hip, pull body across your hip to open a vacuum between your head and their legs.

- Key cues
  - “No setup, no shot.”
  - “Hands to mat, outside elbows, or clear lane – those are your green lights.”
  - “Break the fortress before you enter.”

- Drills & games
  - Setup-only rounds: no shots allowed; score only on hands-to-mat, outside-elbow angles or clean head-to-leg lines.
  - Setup-to-freeze drill: after each successful setup, freeze and verbally identify which condition you created before resetting.

- System tags
  - standup/four-phase-model
  - standup/setup-criteria
  - standup/stance-breaking-setups


### 3.17 Phase 2: Catch

- Key concepts
  - Catch = first secure hand contact on one or both legs (knees, calves, ankles), often requiring some elbow extension and temporary postural risk.
  - Contrary to simplistic coaching slogans, some reaching is inevitable; the key is to keep it controlled and temporary.
  - Primary catch grips use anatomical handles: knee tendons, calf wraps, Achilles, elbow-deep hooks.

- Position / structure
  - Catch grips:
    - Behind-the-knee tendon from inside or outside; uses the tendon as a “handle” that resists retraction.
    - Snaked wrists around calf, single or double; wraps leg to resist sprawl.
    - Elbow-deep around knee; crook of elbow sits in knee hollow.
    - Hands locked high behind thighs under buttocks – strongest but often reached after initial catch.
    - Low Achilles grips for ankle picks.
  - Chest is allowed to come forward to about the knee, but not massively past base; reach is followed by sliding in.

- Key cues
  - “You must touch the legs or you never score.”
  - “Use the tendon, not the shin; hook the anatomy.”
  - “Small, honest reach now; structure will be rebuilt in connection phase.”

- Drills & games
  - Grip-resistance drill: partner constantly retracts legs as you practise knee-tendon, calf and Achilles catches; focus on “feeling the handle.”
  - Reach-and-slide drill: practise brief reaching catches followed by rapid body slide-in to reduce extension.

- System tags
  - standup/catch-phase
  - standup/leg-grip-library
  - standup/reach-management


### 3.18 Phase 3: Building Tighter Connection and Structure

- Key concepts
  - After catch, hands alone are not enough; you must build full-body connection and structure that can carry their weight without collapse.
  - Two structural goals: never let their weight sit on the back of your head/upper back, and never carry weight with bent-over, kneeling posture.
  - You can safely carry weight either with a relatively upright spine or with knees off the floor (or both).

- Position / structure
  - Connection goals:
    - Chest-to-thigh contact.
    - Elbows tight around hamstrings.
    - Ear/head tight to torso.
    - Locked hands preferably high under the buttocks.
  - Structural options:
    - Upright torso with head in front, not bent under them.
    - Or knees off mat even if torso is forward; both knees up allows you to survive heavy sprawls.
  - Worst case: knees down, chest well past base, weight on back of head and shoulders with arms extended.

- Key cues
  - “Hands catch, body connects.”
  - “Either stand up or get your knees up.”
  - “Never gift them the back of your head.”
  - “Glue chest, ear and elbows before carrying weight.”

- Drills & games
  - Sprawl-carry drill: from catches, partner applies realistic sprawl; your sole job is to adjust posture (upright or knees-up) and build chest/ear/elbow connection without finishing.
  - Structure-only rounds: no takedowns; coach calls “bad” whenever weight ends up on back of head or knees stay stuck down under heavy sprawl.

- System tags
  - standup/connection-phase
  - standup/sprawl-management
  - standup/postural-choices


### 3.19 Phase 4: Completion

- Key concepts
  - Two fundamental completion options: put them down to their hips (takedown) or get behind them (ear on back).
  - Completion decisions are driven by how well you control the legs; when leg control is strong, favour direct takedowns, when legs are slipping away, favour circling behind.
  - Completion does not yet equal scoring under jiu-jitsu rules, but it places you in the positions from which scores and back takes are most realistic.

- Position / structure
  - Direct takedown: from locked leg control, drop to your knee(s) in a controlled way, keeping connection as their hips hit the mat.
  - Turn-the-corner option: when legs are sliding away or sprawling off, you post, bring ear to back and circle to rear body lock or rear-control positions.
  - Single-leg case: if running-the-pipe or similar attempts are resisted, switch to getting ear on back and circling rather than dying on the leg.

- Key cues
  - “If legs are yours, put them down; if legs are leaving, go behind.”
  - “Hips to mat or ear to back – those are your finish cues.”
  - “Completion is not the end; it’s the start of scoring.”

- Drills & games
  - Completion choice drill: from mid-connection positions, partner chooses to either sprawl hard back (you must go behind) or stubbornly plant (you must finish to hips).
  - Phase-sparring: constrained rounds starting from connection phase where you can only score by cleanly executing either hip-takedown or get-behind transitions.
