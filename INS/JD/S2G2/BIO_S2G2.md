 ## 0.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- Purpose and scope
  - Define a standing-to-ground framework that prioritises positional dominance, efficient scrimmage-style wrestling and jiu-jitsu-specific scoring over explosive neutral wrestling.
  - Equip athletes to reliably move from standing to ground on their own terms while minimising exposure to counters, submissions and high-impact throws.

- Positional dominance before takedowns
  - Treat dominant standing positions (standing rear body lock, chest-to-back short offence, strong leg-control and lock-double style clinches) as the primary objectives, with takedowns as secondary outcomes once dominance is achieved.
  - Emphasise that most real scoring comes from dominant standing shells rather than from extended neutral exchanges.

- Standing positional hierarchy and neutral-risk management
  - Extend the familiar ground positional hierarchy into the standing phase, recognising that while pins do not exist upright, clear tiers of advantage still govern scoring probability and risk.
  - Frame neutral shots as inherently high-risk and build strategy around steering exchanges into dominant positions where offensive options are abundant and defensive threats are limited.

- Re-shots, stance breaking and aftermath control
  - Use blocked opponent shots and failed takedowns as deliberate stance-breaking tools that open high-percentage re-shot windows against compromised posture.
  - Shift the scoring mindset from “who hit the takedown” to “who wins the immediate aftermath”, with victory defined by back exposure, dominant top position and denial of points against.

- Autonomous jiu-jitsu standing game vs generic wrestling
  - Distinguish between wrestling rule-sets and jiu-jitsu scoring, building a standing system that treats back exposure, guard pulls and submission threats as central variables rather than edge cases.
  - Reject the idea of simply “adding some wrestling” and instead construct an autonomous standing game where every entry, grip and follow-up is chosen for its compatibility with jiu-jitsu rules and objectives.

- Standing escape game and four-point stand-up
  - Replace guard-fall style escapes (which concede takedown points) with a dedicated standing escape and stand-up framework tailored to jiu-jitsu scoring.
  - Use four-point stand-up structures and back-protective movement patterns to deny points, reclaim posture and re-enter dominant or neutral positions without exposing the back.

- Submissions as structured counters in the standing phase
  - Treat submissions as the joker in the standing deck: the great equaliser against superior takedown athletes when used systematically rather than as Hail Mary dives.
  - Require athletes to first slow and control takedown attempts so submission entries arise from stable ties, broken posture and predictable reactions instead of chaotic scrambles.

- Athlete profile, safety and longevity emphasis
  - Target everyday jiu-jitsu practitioners and competitors who may lack elite wrestling attributes but want reliable standing options that preserve neck, knees and long-term training health.
  - Prefer low-amplitude, high-control takedowns, scrimmage-style exchanges and position-first strategies that can be maintained over long careers rather than short bursts of athleticism.


## 1.0 INSTRUCTIONAL VOLUME CONTENT

### 1.1 [Volume 1] Standing Positional Hierarchy, Reshots and Rear Body Lock

- Focus
  - Extend positional hierarchy into the standing phase with clear tiers of advantage.
  - Make rear body lock and short offence the primary standing objectives.
- Key themes
  - Let the opponent shoot first, then exploit compromised stance with reshots.
  - Treat takedowns as a two-phase process: initial knockdown plus aftermath control.
  - Connect takedowns to back exposure rather than stopping at the fall.

### 1.2 [Volume 2] Throw-Bys, Slide-Bys, Ducks and Body Lock Entries

- Focus
  - Build a family of back-taking and angle-creating entries from common ties.
- Key themes
  - Use throw-bys, slide-bys, front headlock entries, duck-unders and wrist ducks to turn collar ties and underhooks into routes to the back.
  - Prioritise getting behind the opponent (rear body lock, body lock) rather than grinding in square neutral ties.
  - Make back access the default outcome of winning the tie battle.

### 1.3 [Volume 3] Two-on-One Study and Rear Body Lock Takedowns

- Focus
  - Develop a structured two-on-one system as a primary standing control shell.
- Key themes
  - Entries to two-on-one, controlling reactions, snapdowns and go-behinds to the back.
  - Link two-on-one dominance directly into standing rear body lock.
  - Build a rear body lock takedown library: reverse trips, reaps, sweeps, doubles and side lifts that land in strong aftermath positions.

### 1.4 [Volume 4] Short Offence and Chest-to-Back Positional Dominance

- Focus
  - Define and systematise short offence as a standing scoring hub.
- Key themes
  - Short offence from sprawls, blocked shots and snapdowns: chest-on-back, knee down, your body in front of their elbows.
  - Use bodyweight, grips and directional pressure to slow the opponent and shut down most submissions.
  - Convert sprawls and failed shots into high-percentage scoring opportunities under jiu-jitsu rules.

### 1.5 [Volume 5] Four-Point Position, Breakdowns and Mat Returns

- Focus
  - Turn the four-point position into a reliable breakdown and scoring platform.
- Key themes
  - Solve arm-position problems from four-point and referee’s positions.
  - Use shoelace and spiral breakdowns, gut wrenches, cradles and seatbelt trips to keep opponents from standing.
  - Build mat-return cycles that repeatedly drag opponents back to the floor and open back-exposure routes.

### 1.6 [Volume 6] Takedown Aftermath Control and Leg Tackle Defence

- Focus
  - Emphasise that winning the takedown battle is about what happens after impact.
- Key themes
  - Step-over and hip-covering mechanics that prevent scrambles and leg entanglements.
  - Head-over-head control, leg pummelling and weight placement to stabilise on top.
  - Structured defence to singles, doubles and head-inside shots that denies points and back exposure rather than just “not getting taken down”.

### 1.7 [Volume 7] Limp-Leg Defence and Standing Escapes

- Focus
  - Present limp-leg as a central defensive tool against high crotch and double-leg attacks.
- Key themes
  - Timing and structure of limp-leg against different leg tackles.
  - Broader standing escape system: hip heists, roll-through counters, Granby-style movements and switches.
  - Replace automatic guard-falls with stand-ups and escapes that avoid conceding takedown scores.

### 1.8 [Volume 8] Standing Submissions Integrated with Takedown Defence

- Focus
  - Integrate submissions into takedown defence as structured, high-quality counters.
- Key themes
  - Guillotines, front-headlock strangles, triangles, kimuras and leg attacks chosen for jiu-jitsu, not wrestling, constraints.
  - Requirement to first slow and control the shot before hunting submissions.
  - Submissions used to finish extended, controlled takedown sequences, not as desperate “Hail Mary” attempts that give away points or the back.

## 2.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### 2.1 Problem Space: Standing to Ground for Jiu-Jitsu Athletes

- Core problem
  - Athletes train mostly on the ground but must start every match standing.
  - Default solutions (random shots, risky guard pulls, “some wrestling”) do not match jiu-jitsu scoring or submission dynamics.
- Incompatibility with pure wrestling
  - Wrestling punishes turning away or turtling; jiu-jitsu often uses these to deny points or bait submissions.
  - Copy-paste wrestling ignores guard, leg locks and back-exposure scoring.
- Standing-to-ground as a process
  - Pipeline: stance → grip & head-position battle → positional dominance (rear body lock, short offence, strong leg-control shells) → takedown/back exposure → aftermath control.
  - Neutral “shot or be shot” is the emergency option, not the default.
- Integration with ground game
  - Standing framework is built to connect into existing jiu-jitsu strengths (guard, passing, back attacks) instead of demanding a new “wrestler identity”.

### 2.2 Positional Hierarchy in the Standing Phase

- Hierarchy concept
  - Ground logic (guard pass → pin → mount/back) is mirrored upright with a hierarchy of standing positions.
  - Some ties are simply more likely to produce points and back exposure.
- Levels of standing dominance
  - Bottom: open neutral, square stance, equal grips and head position.
  - Middle: better grips or head position but still face-to-face.
  - Top tier: standing rear body lock, chest-to-back short offence, strong front headlock with legs controlled, lock-double/double-leg shells with beaten posture.
- Practical rule
  - “Position before takedown” – climb the standing hierarchy before committing to big shots or throws.
  - Dominant positions are hubs you return to after failed attempts rather than falling back to full neutral.

### 2.3 Dominant Standing Positions: Rear Body Lock and Short Offence

- Standing rear body lock
  - Chest-to-back alignment, hands connected around waist/hips, opponent’s weapons largely facing away.
  - Very low submission risk against you, high access to trips, lifts, mat returns and back takes.
- Short offence (chest-on-back, knee down)
  - Chest on opponent’s back, your body in front of their elbows, at least one knee between you.
  - Often arises from sprawls and blocked shots; functions as a scoring factory and breakdown hub.
- Strategic role
  - These two shells are the “mount and back” of the standing phase.
  - System goal: spend as much time as possible in rear body lock and short offence, and treat them as starting points for takedowns and back takes.

### 2.4 Scrimmage Wrestling vs Neutral Wrestling Exchanges

- Neutral wrestling (face-to-face)
  - High risk: exposes neck, back and knees to submissions and heavy sprawls.
  - High energy, often low scoring under jiu-jitsu rules.
- Scrimmage wrestling (after a takedown attempt)
  - Begins once someone has shot, sprawled, snapped or thrown.
  - Battle over hooks, hip-and-shoulder contact, stand-ups, mat returns and back exposure.
- Jiu-jitsu-specific focus
  - Standing system is built around scrimmage scenarios rather than endless neutral shot trading.
  - Attacking map: failed shot → short offence → go-behind → breakdown to four-point/referee’s → hooks/back.
  - Defensive map: survive shot → deny hooks and three-second control → structured stand-ups and escapes → return to neutral or counter to dominance.

### 2.5 Scoring Model: Takedown, Back Exposure and Aftermath Control

- Two-stage scoring
  - Stage 1: takedown event (who goes down, who stays up/on top).
  - Stage 2: aftermath (who gets actual points, who gets back exposure, who stabilises).
- Attacker goals
  - Do not stop at the knockdown; immediately chase either stable top (side, half, mount) or back takes.
  - Treat go-behinds and short offence as pre-scoring positions that must lead to hooks or pin-style control.
- Defender goals
  - If you are taken down, deny hooks and three-second hip-and-shoulder control.
  - Use structured stand-ups, Granby-style movements and reversals instead of conceding guard and accepting points.
- Bottom line
  - The athlete who manages aftermath scrambles best “wins” the standing game, even if they occasionally lose the initial takedown.

### 2.6 Risk Management and Injury-Avoidance Filters

- Design constraints
  - System is built for long-term training health: protect neck, knees and shoulders.
  - “Trainable for decades” > “flashy for six months”.
- Technique selection
  - Favour low-amplitude, high-control finishes from dominant positions (drag go-behinds, conservative trips, knee-drops, body-lock twists, mat returns).
  - De-emphasise big uncontrolled throws and neck-heavy blast doubles.
- Shot and scramble management
  - Avoid extended time with head buried under hips carrying full sprawl.
  - Prefer rotation-based finishes and posture-preserving mechanics over violent twists and dives.
- Strategic filters
  - Encourage reshots from compromised stance; discourage repeated neutral blasts into perfect stance.
  - Replace default guard-pulls (that concede points) with standing escapes and four-point stand-ups that protect both body and scoreboard.


## 3.0 CORE CONCEPTS

### 3.1 Positional Hierarchy Applied to Standing Exchanges

- Extension of hierarchy thinking
  - Treat standing like the ground: some positions are “mount/back”, others are “half-guard” or “bad guard”.
- Standing ladder
  - Base: open neutral stance.
  - Middle: better grips/head but still square.
  - Top: rear body lock, short offence, dominant front headlock, strong leg-control shells.
- Training implication
  - Focus sessions around climbing and re-climbing this ladder.
  - Evaluate techniques by how reliably they move you up or down the hierarchy, not in isolation.

### 3.2 Reshots vs Shots as the Central Efficiency Principle

- Primary shots (from neutral)
  - High-risk, low-yield for most jiu-jitsu athletes.
  - Rely heavily on speed and explosiveness, expose you to sprawls and submissions.
- Reshots (after their shot)
  - Occur when opponent’s stance and posture are already broken from their own attack.
  - Head/hands out of position, feet square or stepping, hips vulnerable.
- Strategic rule
  - “Let them go first; win the reshot.”
  - Build defence and stance so you can safely absorb, slow or stuff their first attack, then immediately attack a compromised structure.

### 3.3 Submissions as the Joker in the Standing Deck

- Role of submissions
  - Powerful equaliser against better wrestlers if used on your terms.
  - Dangerous liability if thrown from bad position or panic.
- Structured use
  - First: slow and control the shot (head position, sprawls, short offence).
  - Then: attack guillotines, kimuras, leg locks, triangles when posture and arm/leg separation are favourable.
- Practical mindset
  - Submissions are layered on top of good defence and position, not used as wild counters.
  - “Control the takedown, then submit” instead of “jump on everything and hope”.

### 3.4 Two-Stage Scoring: Takedown vs Back-Take Outcomes

- Stage 1 – Takedown
  - Who hits the mat, who remains standing/on top.
- Stage 2 – Aftermath
  - Who stabilises in scoring positions or secures the back.
  - Who denies hooks, three-second counts and clear back exposure.
- Selection filter
  - Prefer takedowns and chains that:
    - Land in short offence, four-point, referee’s, or immediate back-take routes.
    - Avoid dumping you into completely neutral open guard.
- Training focus
  - Drill “aftermath sequences” as much as entries.
  - Judge success in sparring by final position and control, not just the initial fall.

### 3.5 Dominant Grip and Head-Position Frameworks

- Core control shells
  - Two-on-one (wrist/elbow or full Russian).
  - Rear body lock.
  - Front headlock.
  - Collar/bicep, collar/underhook style ties that lead to back or short offence.
- Head-position logic
  - Forehead-to-forehead: neutral safety.
  - Forehead-to-collarbone/jaw: attacking angle.
  - Avoid ear-to-ear symmetric ties (no built-in advantage).
- Operational rule
  - Chase grips and head positions that:
    - Open back takes, drags, ducks, throw-bys.
    - Feed directly into front headlock, short offence and scrimmage scenarios.

### 3.6 Standing Positional Defence and Escape Philosophy

- Guard pull vs stand-up
  - Guard-pulls that concede takedown points are last resort, not default.
  - Primary defensive goal: stay on your feet or regain them without giving up points or back exposure.
- Defensive principles
  - Maintain head/hands between opponent’s shoulder line and your hips.
  - Use sprawls to slow and blunt shots, not to flee wildly.
  - Prefer four-point stand-ups, limp-legs, Granby and roll-through escapes to rebuild stance.
- Positional upgrades
  - Escapes are mapped back into the same standing hierarchy: from bad (referee’s, four-point under pressure) back to neutral, short offence, or even rear body lock if they overcommit.
- Outcome
  - You may still be taken down occasionally, but you are very hard to score on and very difficult to back-take, which changes the risk–reward equation for opponents who like to shoot.


## 4.0 TECHNIQUE LIBRARY

### 4.1 Rear Body Lock Entries from Neutral: Arm Drags and Throw-Bys

- Role in the system
  - Primary way to convert neutral hand fighting into the best standing position in the hierarchy: standing rear body lock.
  - Reduces time spent in square, neutral collar-tie battles where both athletes are equally dangerous.

- Core arm-drag mechanics
  - Use wrist–elbow control (two-on-one style) to separate the opponent’s arm from their torso and pull it across your centre line.
  - Step your lead foot to the outside of their near leg as you drag, then pivot your hips so your chest moves toward their back, not toward front headlock.
  - Keep your head close to the shoulder blade or back of the head; avoid drifting away where they can square and re-claim neutral.

- Throw-by / slide-by mechanics
  - When the opponent posts hard on your collar, digs underhooks or extends a stiff arm, guide that arm across your body instead of fighting it head-on.
  - Use a small pull–push pattern: first draw them in to load weight onto the posting leg, then “open the door” by stepping out and throwing the arm past.
  - Slide your body into the space they have just vacated, aiming immediately for chest-to-back contact and waist connection.

- Connection to rear body lock
  - As soon as your chest is roughly behind their shoulder line, connect hands around the waist or upper torso; do not pause to “admire” the angle.
  - Walk your lock down the torso if necessary (upper ribs → lower ribs → lumbar) to secure control over the hip line.
  - Angle your stance very slightly off to one side (not perfectly centred behind them) to reduce their ability to hit forward-throw counters.

- Decision rules
  - If their arm is bent and close to the body, favour arm drags and two-on-one style entries.
  - If their arm is straight and posting or if they overcommit to collar ties/underhooks, favour throw-bys and slide-bys.
  - If you fail to clear the arm but get strong head position, accept front headlock or short offence rather than forcing the drag.

- Common errors
  - Dragging without moving your feet so you end up in front of the opponent instead of behind them.
  - Allowing your head to drift away from their shoulder line and giving them time to square up.
  - Letting go of the arm before you have actually won the angle, which drops you back into neutral ties.


### 4.2 Standing Rear Body Lock Takedown Families

- Role in the system
  - Convert the single best standing position (rear body lock) into low-risk, high-control takedowns that lead directly into scoring or back exposure.
  - Prioritise finishes that keep your chest attached to their back and avoid wild, high-amplitude throws.

- Reverse trips and reaps
  - From a tight waist, step behind or next to their near leg, using your thigh or calf as a physical barrier that shortens their base.
  - Rotate your lock and upper body so their shoulders drift behind their heels, forcing the hands and then hips toward the mat.
  - Use inside and outside reaps to remove the support leg while keeping your hips glued to their belt line.

- Side lifts and knee-drop finishes
  - When they widen stance and lean forward to avoid trips, step your hips deep, load their weight onto your thighs and perform a short lift, not a big throw.
  - Combine the lift with a small lateral step or knee-drop so they are lowered under control while you maintain chest-to-back alignment.
  - Land with at least one knee up and your chest still on the back, ready to insert hooks or transition to four-point breakdowns.

- Hip-line control and head position
  - Keep your lock centred around the lumbar region to stop their hips escaping; avoid very high locks around the chest alone.
  - Keep your head roughly in line with the spine or slightly off to one side; if your head drifts far to one side, expect strong side-drops and rolls.
  - Squeeze elbows towards your own ribs to clamp the lock and prevent them from pummelling their hands inside.

- Decision rules
  - If they lean heavily forward, emphasise reverse trips and mat-return style takedowns.
  - If they stand tall or try to run away, emphasise side lifts and controlled knee drops.
  - If you lose full body lock but keep one side attached, accept transitions to seatbelt, four-point or leg tackles rather than forcing the original lock.

- Common errors
  - Trying to hit large, explosive suplex-style throws that are hard to land safely and often lose back exposure.
  - Allowing too much space between your hips and theirs, which invites turns, granby rolls and guard jumps.
  - Falling to your side without maintaining upper-body attachment, giving them a chance to scramble straight to guard or stand.


### 4.3 Short Offence Entries, Controls and Go-Behinds

- Role in the system
  - Turn sprawls, stuffed shots and heavy snapdowns into a dominant chest-to-back shell that is safer than front headlock and richer in scoring options.
  - Provide a structured way to “win” from defending takedowns rather than merely stopping them.

- Entries into short offence
  - From a sprawl: flatten their hips, move your chest over the upper back and slide one knee between their thighs while circling off the line of their shot.
  - From snapdowns: walk them forward until hands touch the mat, then step into the space above their hips while your chest replaces your hands on the upper back.
  - From front headlock: spin behind in a controlled arc, maintaining chest pressure and dropping a knee between their knees rather than leaping to the side.

- Core control structures
  - Double pits: both arms threaded deeply in the armpits, hands near the upper back, chest heavy over their shoulder line.
  - Spiral ride variations: one arm at the hip, one at the shoulder or elbow, used to turn their shoulders and collapse posts.
  - Ankle controls and shoelace grips: capture one or both ankles while keeping chest on back to deny effective builds to base.

- Go-behinds and positional upgrades
  - Slide your knee deeper between their legs and use hip pressure to steer their hips while your upper body walks toward the far hip.
  - Convert from double pits or spiral ride to rear body lock by releasing one arm, swimming it around the waist and re-clamping.
  - When they post hands to stand, time your go-behind so you arrive at rear body lock as they reach, before they can fully square.

- Decision rules
  - If they are static on hands and knees, focus on breakdowns and mat returns before chasing the back.
  - If they are actively trying to stand, prioritise go-behinds and rear body lock entries using their stand-up energy against them.
  - If their neck is consistently available without exposing your own, accept transitions to front headlock only under good structural conditions.

- Common errors
  - Hovering over the head rather than the upper back, giving them space to peek out or roll.
  - Staying too long in front headlock from this configuration and missing easier back-take or breakdown options.
  - Failing to insert a knee between their legs, which makes it easy for them to stand and turn back in.


### 4.4 Reshot Patterns and Follow-Up Chains

- Role in the system
  - Shift takedown emphasis from first shots (hardest) to reshots (easier, against compromised stance).
  - Turn every defended or partially blocked shot into an opportunity rather than a reset.

- First-layer reshot behaviour
  - When your own shot is stuffed, keep your head up and hands connected long enough to sense where their weight and posts are.
  - Use the defender’s reactions (sprawl, whizzer, crossface, switch) to open new lanes: e.g., re-enter on a second leg, pivot to back, or drop to ankle picks.
  - Maintain the mindset that the initial failure is often the setup for the higher-percentage second attempt.

- Opponent-shot reshot behaviour
  - After defending a shot (sprawl, limp leg, short offence), immediately look for reshot moments when they start to stand but haven’t fully rebuilt stance.
  - Target squared feet, extended arms and rising head as your main green lights for doubles, singles or back-take entries.
  - Build automatic links: sprawl → snap → spin or go-behind; limp leg → back-take; front headlock → snap to four-point → reshot to legs or back.

- Standard chains
  - Shot to reshot: single → stuffed → pivot to near knee and reshoot double or backside finish.
  - Defence to reshot: defend their double → short offence → go-behind → breakdown to four-point or re-entry to your own shot when they stand.
  - Two-on-one to reshot: 2-on-1 controls arm → opponent rips free and steps square → immediate level change and double or high-crotch.

- Decision rules
  - Do not reshoot if their stance has fully recovered; reset grips and posture first.
  - Prioritise reshots that move you “up the hierarchy” (to back, short offence, dominant legs) over ones that simply put you back in front of them.
  - If you feel your posture is breaking under repeated attempts, abandon the chain and exit rather than forcing one more desperate shot.

- Common errors
  - Treating a stuffed shot as the end of the exchange instead of the beginning of a reshot sequence.
  - Launching reshots with the same angle and entry path that just failed, without using the new information you gained.
  - Ignoring clear back-take or short-offence opportunities while stubbornly chasing leg tackles.


### 4.5 Scoring and Breakdowns from Turtle, Referee’s and Four-Point Positions

- Role in the system
  - Turn turtle, referee’s and four-point into primary scoring hubs where you can repeatedly break opponents down and expose the back.
  - Replace “hold them here and think” with structured sequences of grips, breakdowns and hook entries.

- Entry contexts
  - Opponent turtles to avoid clean takedown scores or to stall after a failed shot.
  - Scrambles from short offence, rear body lock or leg tackles that end with them on hands and knees.
  - Stand-up attempts that get half-finished, leaving them in a referee’s or four-point shape.

- Grip and control priorities
  - Solve arm and elbow positioning first: wrist control, inside biceps, claw and spiral rides, seatbelt variations.
  - Use shoelace grips (hooking your instep over their ankle) and spiral hooks to remove key posts before trying to throw them over.
  - Keep your chest connected to their upper back; avoid drifting to pure side-rides that give easy granby and sit-out space.

- Breakdown mechanics
  - Spiral breakdowns: use a hip-side hand and opposite-side head/arm control to rotate their shoulders and collapse the near elbow or post.
  - Shoelace and ankle breakdowns: trap an ankle with your instep, drive hips forward and use upper-body grips to topple them to a hip.
  - Gut-wrench and cradle-style actions: join hands around torso or leg–head combination to roll them to their side or back with control.

- Scoring conversions
  - As they fall from breakdowns, immediately slide knees and hips to claim pin-like top positions (side control, chest-to-back, strong half guard), not loose top turtle.
  - Use seatbelt and hook insertion mechanics when their back stays exposed; favour one hook and strong upper-body control over chasing both hooks too early.
  - If they belly down after breakdowns, re-attack with further breakdowns and mat returns rather than allowing stand-ups.

- Common errors
  - Attacking big rolls and cradles before establishing basic wrist, elbow and ankle control.
  - Leaning too far over the hips, giving them easy switches or sit-outs.
  - Failing to link breakdowns to immediate hook or pin attempts, which allows repeated escapes and stand-ups.


### 4.6 Aftermath Control: Leg Stepping, Hip Coverage and Head-Over-Head

- Role in the system
  - Define what happens in the crucial 3–5 seconds after impact when takedown scoring and back exposure are decided.
  - Provide concrete rules for leg stepping, hip coverage and head position that turn knockdowns into real scores.

- Leg stepping and leg pummelling
  - After a takedown, immediately use your legs to step over, staple or windshield-wiper past their legs rather than sitting in a neutral entangled position.
  - When they turn to knees or hips, pummel your shins and knees inside to block guard recovery paths and stop them threading hooks.
  - Use step-over manoeuvres (e.g., stepping over the near leg to half guard or three-quarter mount) to connect takedown impact directly to passing positions.

- Hip coverage principles
  - Keep at least one of your hips above and slightly ahead of theirs so their hip line is always under pressure and cannot freely rotate.
  - If they turn away, slide your hip line up behind their hips to deny them a clean turtle; if they turn in, slide your hips across the belt line to claim side or half guard top.
  - Avoid falling chest-on-chest while your hips remain far away; hip distance is treated as a bigger problem than upper-body distance.

- Head-over-head and shoulder line control
  - Aim to keep your head over their head or over their shoulder line so gravity is working in your favour; if their head is above yours, expect reversals.
  - Use forehead or jaw posts to pin their head in directions that make guard recovery and stand-ups inefficient.
  - Tie head position to hips: head over their head and hips over their hips is the basic “aftermath alignment” you want.

- Decision rules
  - If you land in half-guard-like entanglements, prioritise head-over-head and hip coverage before passing; consensus is that a held half guard with head/hip dominance still scores well in scrimmage.
  - If they immediately turn away, prioritise following to back exposure with hooks or hip rides rather than wrestling them back flat first.
  - If they underhook or come up to the knees in the scramble, treat it as a short-offence opportunity instead of insisting on staying chest-to-chest.

- Common errors
  - Admiring the takedown and not moving your legs or hips for the first few seconds, which gives them time to recover guard or stand.
  - Allowing your head to fall below theirs, especially when chasing legs or entanglements on the mat.
  - Accepting 50/50 scrambles after impact instead of insisting on clear head–hip alignment in your favour.


### 4.7 Leg-Tackle Defences: Sprawl, Limp Leg and Counters

- Role in the system
  - Provide a structured defensive shell against singles, doubles and high crotches that keeps you on your feet and hard to score on.
  - Turn defence into a platform for immediate counters and reshots, not just “not being taken down”.

- Sprawl fundamentals
  - Drop hips back and down, aiming to put your hip line over the opponent’s upper back, not just your chest over their shoulders.
  - Maintain good head position (chin tucked, forehead active) and hand fighting instead of diving your chest forward and sacrificing posture.
  - Use angled sprawls when possible: sprawl slightly off-line so their head and arms are steered to one side, opening short-offence entries.

- Limp-leg mechanics
  - When they climb high on a single or high crotch, post on the head/neck with both hands, bring your knee above their lock line, then quickly rotate the knee down so the lower leg slips free.
  - Time the limp leg as they rise or adjust rather than when they are fully settled; you want their weight slightly off-balance.
  - As your leg frees, immediately pivot to either back-takes, two-on-one counters or stance re-entry rather than simply backing away.

- Counter-offence from defence
  - From a good sprawl, slide into front headlock, short offence or spin-behind positions rather than resetting to neutral.
  - From limp-leg escapes, step into two-on-one, underhook or rear body lock as their hands overcommit to the failed finish.
  - From stuffed head-inside doubles, attack guillotines or front headlock series only when head and arm angles are favourable and your hips are safe.

- Decision rules
  - If their grip is strong on the leg but posture is broken, prioritise limp leg and back-take options.
  - If they are deeply under your hips with pressure, prioritise sprawls and short offence rather than trying to hop out of holds.
  - If your neck feels exposed during defence, correct head position before thinking of submissions or counters.

- Common errors
  - Sprawling with hips too high, leaving weight on your chest and shoulders and making you easy to run down.
  - Attempting limp legs when the opponent’s hands are still low on the ankle or when your own posture is too broken to support the movement.
  - Fishing for guillotines and kimuras from structurally poor positions that gift them the takedown and back exposure.


### 4.8 Standing Submissions Integrated with Takedown Defence

- Role in the system
  - Provide a submission layer that sits on top of robust positional defence and scrimmage wrestling.
  - Punish overcommitted takedowns and lazy stance, especially in no-gi formats where chokes and kimuras are high percentage.

- Guillotine and front-headlock submissions
  - Attack guillotines when the shooter’s head is extended and their arms are fully committed to the legs, not when they still have strong posture and frames.
  - Use front headlock snaps to bring them to hands and knees, then choose between finishing on the feet, dropping to guard, or converting to back-takes depending on rule set and risk appetite.
  - Integrate strangles into existing short-offence and front headlock chains rather than building isolated “guillotine-only” habits.

- Kimura, arm-in and arm-drag submissions
  - Use kimura grips when the opponent’s arm is separated from the body during shots, stand-ups or turtle transitions.
  - Connect kimuras to takedown defence by stepping off to the side, pinning their head and using the kimura both as a submission and as a lever for breakdowns.
  - Use arm drags not only for back-takes but also to expose extended arms for quick standing armlocks or transitions to triangles.

- Leg attacks and standing entries
  - Consider leg attacks (inside sankaku, kani-basami-style entries, ashi garami transitions) only from head-safe, posture-safe situations where your neck and back are not exposed.
  - Use sprawls and short offence to first flatten the opponent or at least break posture before dropping back for legs.
  - Emphasise leg attacks that end in strong control (inside position, tight ashi) rather than speculative falls that give up top position and points.

- Decision rules
  - Submissions are secondary options once position and posture are favourable; they do not replace basic defence and scrambling.
  - If a submission attempt would require you to abandon strong positional dominance (rear body lock, short offence, tight body lock) for a 50/50 trade, favour position.
  - If a submission fails, have a clear escape or rebuild path back into the standing hierarchy, not a blind fall to bottom.

- Common errors
  - Diving for guillotines and kimuras as panic reactions to well-structured shots.
  - Initiating leg attacks from poor head/hip alignment, leading to immediate smash passes or back-takes against you.
  - Treating standing submissions as one-off tricks instead of integrated tools inside the broader positional and scrimmage framework.


## 5.0 DIAGRAM SET

### 5.1 Standing Positional Hierarchy and Dominant Positions Map

- Purpose
  - Give a single-page visual of the standing hierarchy so athletes can see “where they are” in an exchange.
  - Clarify which positions are upgrades, lateral moves or downgrades.

- Structure (conceptual layout)
  - Bottom tier: open neutral stance (square, equal grips/head).
  - Mid tier: advantage ties (2-on-1, dominant collar/bicep, front headlock with posture, strong underhook/wrist combos).
  - Top tier: standing rear body lock, chest-to-back short offence, strong front headlock with posts, dominant leg-control shells feeding reshots.
  - Arrows showing:
    - Neutral → advantage ties (via hand fighting and head position).
    - Advantage ties → back/short offence (via drags, throw-bys, snapdowns, ducks).
    - Back/short offence → takedowns/back takes/aftermath positions.

- Usage
  - As a reference page in VN and sessions to decide what you should be aiming for in any given standing exchange.
  - As a coaching tool to label rounds (“today you can only move between mid and top tiers; no random shots from neutral”).

#### Notes

- Goal in the standing phase:
  - Spend as little time as possible in OPEN NEUTRAL.
  - Climb to ADVANTAGE TIES, then to TOP TIER STANDING POSITIONS.
  - From TOP TIER, move directly into AFTERMATH CONTROL & SCORING.

- Typical “upward” paths:
  - Neutral → Advantage ties:
    - Hand fighting, stance manipulation, head-position wins, collar/wrist sequences, 2-on-1 entries.
  - Advantage ties → Top tier:
    - Arm drags, throw-bys, slide-bys, duck-unders, snapdowns, spins to back,
      limp-leg to back, sprawl → short offence transitions.
  - Top tier → Aftermath:
    - Rear body lock takedown families, short-offence breakdowns, mat returns,
      direct back-take chains, leg pummels into stable top.

- Typical “downward” defensive paths:
  - From Top tier (when you are stuck underneath or controlled):
    - Structured escapes from rear body lock, short-offence stand-ups, rolls and switches
      that aim to recover ADVANTAGE TIES or at least safe NEUTRAL without conceding points.


### 5.2 Rear Body Lock and Short Offence Entry Tree

- Purpose
  - Show all the main ways into rear body lock and short offence, grouped by starting tie.
  - Make it obvious that most hand-fighting roads are supposed to end at the back or chest-on-back, not in endless collar-tie trading.

- Structure (conceptual layout)
  - Left column: starting situations
    - Neutral collar-and-wrist / collar-and-bicep.
    - Over/under and double-unders.
    - Front headlock.
    - Sprawl / defended shot.
    - Two-on-one.
  - Middle: entry techniques
    - Arm drags, throw-bys, slide-bys, duck-unders, wrist ducks.
    - Snapdowns, spin-behinds, limp-leg to back.
    - Sprawl to short offence, front headlock shucks, knee slides behind.
  - Right column: destination positions
    - Standing rear body lock.
    - Chest-to-back short offence.
    - Four-point / referee’s that immediately feed back-take or mat-return sequences.

- Usage
  - As a planning tool: pick 1–2 entries from each starting situation to form your personal A-game tree.
  - To diagnose gaps: if a starting tie has no clear arrow to rear body lock or short offence in your game, that’s a flag for drilling.


   (STARTING TIES / SITUATIONS)             (ENTRIES)                    (DESTINATIONS)

   |  (you defended with post)   |     |  TURN THE CORNER  |     |  (if you win behind hips)  |
   +-----------------------------+     +-------------------+     +----------------------------+


#### Notes

- Design intent
  - Any time you win a tie, the “correct answer” is to move toward back or chest-on-back, not stay square.
  - Rear body lock and short offence are treated as destination shells, not rare bonus positions.

- Typical coaching cues
  - From collar ties: “Drag the arm past the hip, step around, close the lock.”
  - From over/under: “When he drives in, open the door and throw the arm by.”
  - From front headlock: “If his hands touch the mat, think either spin-behind or short offence.”
  - From sprawl: “Chest off his head, onto his back; knee in, then lock.”

- Training use
  - Pick 1–2 entries from each starting tie and drill until every neutral tie in sparring
    “wants” to become rear body lock or short offence.

### 5.3 Reshot and Follow-Up Flowchart

- Purpose
  - Turn reshot logic into a simple decision tree: what to do after your own shot stalls or after you defend theirs.
  - Emphasise that “stuffed shot” and “sprawl” are midpoints, not endpoints.

- Structure (conceptual layout)
  - Branch 1: Your shot is stuffed
    - Node: “Head up, hands connected?”
      - Yes → branch to:
        - Pivot to new angle and reshoot same leg.
        - Drop to ankle/knee and chase secondary leg.
        - Abandon legs and climb to body lock or front headlock.
      - No → immediate exit/reset or guard-pull contingency (labelled as last resort).
  - Branch 2: You defend their shot
    - Node: “Did you get short offence / front headlock / back angle?”
      - Short offence → go-behind or breakdown tree.
      - Front headlock → snapdown to four-point or back-take, or reshot when they stand.
      - Back angle → rear body lock → rear body lock takedown family.
    - Node: “Did they start to stand with poor stance?” → reshot single/double or body lock.

- Usage
  - Printed next to takedown drilling area as a quick reminder of what should follow each defended attack.
  - In session design: choose one path (e.g. “your shot stuffed → reshot to back side double”) and build a whole round around that chain.

LEGEND

- “Your shot is stuffed”
  - First check posture & grips:
    - If structure is good → reshot choices.
    - If structure is broken → bail, reset or (last resort) guard-pull.

- “You defend their shot”
  - Aim to convert defence into a control shell:
    - Front headlock
    - Short offence
    - Back angle / rear body lock
  - From each shell:
    - Break them to four-point / referee’s.
    - Either:
      - Reshot when they stand badly, or
      - Go straight to hooks/back / stable top after breakdowns.

- Core rule
  - Stuffed shots and sprawls are MIDPOINTS, not endpoints:
    - From your failed shot → reshot or climb.
    - From their failed shot → short offence, front headlock, or back,
      then breakdown → back exposure or stable top.

### 5.4 Scoring and Aftermath Control Branches

- Purpose
  - Show what should happen in the first 3–5 seconds after any takedown impact.
  - Make scoring criteria (points, back exposure, control) visually explicit.

- Structure (conceptual layout)
  - Start node: “Opponent hits the mat”
    - Branch A: “They land facing you”
      - Sub-branches:
        - Knees in: step-over to half guard / three-quarter mount, secure head-over-head and hip coverage.
        - Open guard attempt: leg pummel, knee cuts, backstep sequences.
    - Branch B: “They land turning away / turtling”
      - Sub-branches:
        - Slide to hip ride / seatbelt and hunt hooks.
        - Mat returns back to four-point with breakdowns if they start to stand.
    - Branch C: “They land on side / seated”
      - Sub-branches:
        - Clamp head and near hip, transition to side control or strong half.
        - Chase back exposure if they start to turn to knees.

- Additional overlays
  - Icons or markers for:
    - “Three-second control” (point-stabilisation window).
    - “Hook risk” (where you must protect vs them taking *your* back).
    - “Submission windows” (safe guillotine/kimura/leg-attack moments).

- Usage
  - As a debrief tool: after sparring, trace actual exchanges on the chart to see where you dropped control.
  - To design aftermath-only rounds: start at the “they hit the mat” node and train only the branches from there.

#### Notes

- Primary scoring targets
  - Any branch that yields:
    - Clear back exposure + hooks / seatbelt, or
    - Stable top (side, strong half, mount style control) for ≥ 3 seconds.

- Attacker priority by branch
  - Branch A (facing you)
    - Win the leg pummel first, then connect to passes or step-overs.
    - Keep head over head and hips over hips to avoid “double-guard” neutral.
  - Branch B (turning away / turtling)
    - Do not chase them around the corner; instead, attach to hips (hip ride, seatbelt).
    - Use mat returns and breakdowns to keep them on the floor until hooks or pin-style control appear.
  - Branch C (on side / seated)
    - Clamp head and near hip to prevent full turn-in or full turn-away.
    - Convert quickly to strong half or side; treat “seated guard” as a transient, not a destination.

- Defensive read
  - Any time you feel yourself sliding into Branch D (their active guard / entanglement), recognise that the aftermath is slipping:
    - Either disengage and reset, or
    - Immediately re-enter on your terms (body lock, headquarters, knee-cut), not theirs.

- Training use
  - Start positional rounds from the “Opponent hits the mat” node.
  - Pre-select a branch (A, B or C) and only train the finish and stabilisation from that branch for that round.

### 5.5 Defensive Reactions and Escape Routes from Dominant Positions

- Purpose
  - Give defenders a clear visual map of how to survive and escape from the system’s own dominant positions.
  - Reinforce the idea that defence is also structured and position-based, not just scrambling.

- Structure (conceptual layout)
  - Section 1: From rear body lock (you are being controlled)
    - Arrows to:
      - Hip heist and turn-in to underhook / over-under.
      - Sit and scoot to guard with minimal back exposure (emergency path).
      - Granby-style roll when opponent’s lock and head position are poorly aligned.
  - Section 2: From short offence (you are underneath)
    - Arrows to:
      - Four-point stand-up series (post, knee-up, head up, turn-in).
      - Roll-through and switch options when they overcommit to one side.
      - Guard-pull contingency explicitly marked as “last resort / point concession”.
  - Section 3: From four-point / referee’s (you are bottom)
    - Arrows to:
      - Tripod/technical stand-ups that protect back.
      - Granby and sit-out chains to return to neutral or underhook.
      - Risk-flagged routes (e.g. turning the wrong way into back exposure).

- Usage
  - As a companion to the hierarchy map so athletes see both sides: how to climb the ladder and how to safely fall or step down it.
  - For defensive-focused blocks: choose 1–2 bad positions and train all escape branches until they feel as mapped as the offensive trees.

Key micro-routes from rear body lock:

- Hip heist & turn-in
  - Step one foot outside opponent’s foot line.
  - Drop hips and rotate hard to face them, aiming to catch:
    - Over/under
    - Double underhooks
    - Strong underhook + head position
  - Target outcome: back to “Advantage ties / neutral” without conceding hooks.

- Granby / shoulder roll (when lock is high and head position poor)
  - If opponent’s lock is high on chest and head drifts off to one side:
    - Drop to a knee on the “open” side.
    - Roll over the shoulder under their arm, looking to:
      - Land in guard, or
      - Come up on a single / underhook.
  - Marked as higher risk but valuable when hips are very compromised.

      +------------------------------+   +------------------------------+


Key micro-routes from short offence:

- Four-point stand-up
  - Build:
    - Elbows in → hands posted → knee under chest → head up.
  - Sequence:
    - Win inside hands.
    - Post one foot outside.
    - Turn in to face or stand and separate.
  - Target outcome: return to stance or underhook / front headlock exchanges.

- Roll-through / switch (when they overload one side)
  - If they lean heavily to one side:
    - Roll under that side shoulder.
    - Switch hips, come up on single or hip.
  - Target outcome: reverse to top or at least scramble back to neutral.

+---------------------------+


Key micro-routes from four-point / referee’s:

- Tripod / technical stand-up (back-safe)
  - Priorities:
    - Keep elbows tight, hands inside.
    - Stagger base so hips move away from hook attempts.
  - Sequence:
    - Build from knees → one foot up → hand to the floor opposite that foot.
    - Slide hips back and up while turning to face.
  - Target outcome: safe return to stance without conceding hooks or easy re-shots.

- Granby / sit-out chains
  - When they commit heavy pressure on hips or reach deep over waist:
    - Roll shoulder to the side with least head control (Granby).
    - Or sit-out, clearing hips from under their weight to face them.
  - Target outcome: escape to neutral, underhook, or new scrimmage where they no longer have clean back access.


#### Summary Heuristics

- From standing rear body lock (you are caught):
  - First choice: hip heist and turn-in to over/under.
  - Emergency: sit/scoot to guard with minimal back exposure if you cannot rotate.

- From short offence:
  - First choice: structured four-point stand-up that never exposes back.
  - Opportunistic: roll/switch only when they heavily overload one side.

- From four-point / referee’s:
  - First choice: tripod/technical stand-up with back-protective angles.
  - Secondary: Granby/sit-out chains when head and hip control are overcommitted.

- Guard-pull and “give up back” paths:
  - Explicitly marked as last-resort options; main goal is always:
    - Deny hooks and three-second control.
    - Rebuild stance or recover to a safer tier in the standing hierarchy.


## 6.0 DRILLING PROGRESSIONS

### 6.1 Solo Drills: Stance, Movement and Penetration Mechanics

- Objectives
  - Build a stance and movement base that can carry real bodyweight without collapsing under sprawls.
  - Make level changes, penetration steps and recoveries reflexive so cognitive load can be spent on timing and decision-making.
  - Ingrain directional changes (forward, back, lateral, circular) that support both offence and scrimmage defence.

- Stance and footwork patterns
  - Stance holds:
    - Timed static holds in wrestling stance (30–60s) with focus on:
      - Weight centred, knees bent, hips back but not tall.
      - Hands and head in realistic defensive positions.
    - Add small “bounce” and direction changes while keeping level constant.
  - Movement ladders:
    - Forward–backward shuffles with strict rule: no crossing feet, no popping up.
    - Lateral shuffles (left/right) maintaining hip and shoulder alignment.
    - Circular steps around an invisible opponent to mimic angle creation for drags, ducks and reshots.

- Level change and penetration mechanics
  - Stationary level changes:
    - Hands on hips or at head to prevent “arm-only” level changes.
    - Focus on bending knees, not spine; keep head over leading knee, not diving past toes.
  - Penetration steps:
    - Shadow double-leg: step, knee drop, back straight, trail leg follows in, then recover to stance.
    - Shadow single/high crotch: penetration step to “knee line”, head up, back straight, then stand back into stance.
    - Emphasise recovery: every shot ends with a clean rebuild of stance, not a lazy stand-up.

- Scrimmage-oriented solo drills
  - Sprawl and re-stand:
    - Drop hips and chest toward floor, then immediately recover to stance without using hands if possible.
    - Add small pivot on re-stand to mimic turning the corner after defence.
  - Hip-heist and technical stand-up chains:
    - From seated or four-point-like shapes, practised as solo patterns to make standing escapes automatic.
  - Granby and shoulder roll patterns:
    - Controlled rolls over each shoulder with emphasis on tucking head and re-facing stance at the end.

---

### 6.2 Partner Drills: Entries to Rear Body Lock and Short Offence

- Objectives
  - Turn collar ties, two-on-ones and over/unders into automatic back or chest-on-back entries.
  - Make rear body lock and short offence the “default” reward for winning hand fights and takedown defences.

- Rear body lock entry series
  - Arm-drag circuits:
    - A/B alternate:
      - A gains wrist–elbow control, executes drag and angle step to rear body lock.
      - B practises safe turn-in and stance recovery.
    - Progression:
      - Start from static collar-and-wrist.
      - Add light movement and stance changes.
      - Finally add resistance: B tries to keep square, A must time drag off real pulls/pushes.
  - Throw-by / slide-by drills:
    - From over/under or collar ties:
      - Partner gives realistic pressure on collar or underhook.
      - Attacker practises “open the door” footwork and throw-by into rear body lock.
    - Emphasise:
      - Using opponent’s force, not muscling.
      - Immediate hand connection around waist on angle win.

- Short offence entry series
  - Sprawl-to-short-offence:
    - B shoots controlled single/double.
    - A sprawls, clears head, slides chest from head to upper back and inserts knee to create short offence.
    - Freeze and check:
      - Chest on back, at least one knee between, hands in double pits or spiral ride.
  - Snapdown-to-short-offence:
    - From neutral ties:
      - A snaps B to hands, walks feet back to “stretch” posture, then steps into chest-on-back with knee in.
    - Add progression:
      - Start static, then add movement, then light resistance to snap and entry.

- Linking entries to next actions
  - From rear body lock:
    - Every rep must finish with either:
      - A controlled mat-return-style takedown, or
      - A mat-return “fake” followed by re-stabilisation in rear body lock.
  - From short offence:
    - Every rep must finish with either:
      - A go-behind to full rear body lock, or
      - A breakdown to four-point / referee’s with clear grips (spiral, shoelace, seatbelt).

---

### 6.3 Partner Drills: Reshot Patterns and Follow-Up Chains

- Objectives
  - Make reshots the centre of the takedown game: “go second and win.”
  - Standardise a small number of high-percentage chains so athletes do not improvise under pressure.

- Your shot is stuffed – reshot chains
  - Double-to-reshoot double:
    - A shoots double, B sprawls with realistic but controlled pressure.
    - A keeps head up and hands connected, pivots off to one side and hits a second double on a new angle.
  - Single-to-switch-leg:
    - A shoots single, B defends by turning knee out and sprawling.
    - A drops to ankle or second leg and either:
      - Runs the pipe / dump, or
      - Switches to backside double.
  - Exit versus reshoot decision drill:
    - B’s job is to either give moderate sprawl (reshootable) or hard crossface/whizzer (exit).
    - A must read and either commit to reshot or bail and reset; no lazy “half-shots.”

- You defend their shot – reshot chains
  - Sprawl-to-go-behind:
    - B shoots, A sprawls and immediately:
      - Spins to short offence, then
      - Either go-behind to rear body lock or breakdown to four-point.
  - Sprawl-to-reshot:
    - B shoots, A sprawls and stuffs.
    - As B starts to rise with poor stance, A immediately attacks:
      - Front-headlock snap to reshot, or
      - Direct double/single on squared feet.
  - Limp-leg-to-back-take:
    - B shoots high single, A practises limp-leg timing, turning knee out and down to free leg.
    - As leg comes free, A steps behind hips and locks rear body lock or two-on-one rather than disengaging.

- Chain-building rounds
  - Specific chain rounds:
    - Example chain: defend double → short offence → go-behind → breakdown → hooks.
    - Roll with constraint that A must hit full chain to “score”; anything less is treated as incomplete.
  - Timed “reshot only” rounds:
    - All entries must be reshots after some defence or stuff; primary shots from clean neutral are not allowed.

---

### 6.4 Positional Sparring: Scoring and Aftermath Control Scenarios

- Objectives
  - Train the decisive 3–5 seconds after impact where points and back exposure are won or lost.
  - Remove focus from “who got the takedown” and place it on “who ends up in the superior scoring position.”

- Starting positions
  - Branch A: they land facing you (guard-facing)
    - Start with:
      - A on top, B on back/hip, legs in between (open guard/half guard shapes).
    - Goal for A:
      - Immediate leg pummels, step-overs, hip and head alignment, then 3-second stabilisation.
    - Goal for B:
      - Deny head-over-head and hip coverage; either re-guard or stand without conceding a 3-second control.
  - Branch B: they turn away / turtle
    - Start with:
      - B on hands and knees, A in short offence or near hip ride.
    - Goal for A:
      - Use breakdowns and mat returns to create back exposure or stable top with clear counts.
    - Goal for B:
      - Use four-point stand-ups, granby and sit-outs to avoid hooks and scores.
  - Branch C: they land on side / seated
    - Start with:
      - B seated or on hip; A partially attached (head and near-hip control).
    - Goal for A:
      - Convert immediately to strong half, side control or back.
    - Goal for B:
      - Use seated guard frames and scoots to either stand or establish a robust guard before 3-second control.

- Scoring rules for rounds
  - Attacker “wins” the exchange when:
    - They achieve 3-second stable top or clear back exposure with seatbelt/hook.
  - Defender “wins” the exchange when:
    - They stand or establish a guard where head-over-head and hip coverage are neutral or in their favour before 3 seconds.
  - Rotate roles and branches so both attack and defence are trained.

- Integration drills
  - Takedown-to-aftermath chain:
    - Start from standing, allow only 1–2 entries per partner.
    - Once someone hits the mat, freeze the entry and continue only from aftermath—no further takedowns.
  - “No points until aftermath” rounds:
    - In situational sparring, do not count any initial takedown; score the round solely on aftermath positions and control.

---

### 6.5 Positional Sparring: Takedown Defences and Standing Submissions

- Objectives
  - Build a defensive shell that is extremely hard to score on even when you are taken down.
  - Integrate standing submissions as controlled, high-quality counters layered on good defence.

- Pure defence rounds
  - Shot-defence only:
    - B’s job: attack with singles/doubles/high crotch at moderate intensity.
    - A’s job: sprawl, limp-leg, hip-heist and stand without conceding points or back exposure; submissions are off-limits initially.
  - Stand-up and escape rounds:
    - Start from worst-case scrimmage positions (four-point under pressure, deep single, near-finish doubles).
    - A must deny hooks/3-second control and return to stance or neutral ties; B scores only on clear back or sustained top.

- Defence-plus-submission rounds
  - Guillotine and front-headlock integration:
    - Start from properly defended shots (good sprawl, safe head position).
    - A may now attack guillotines and front-headlock strangles, but only if:
      - Head is off centre and controlled.
      - Hips are safe (no easy run-down).
    - If submission fails, A must still prioritise standing escapes or back-takes, not fall into bad guard positions.
  - Kimura and arm trap integration:
    - From failed shots, stand-ups and turtle attempts, A looks for:
      - Kimura grips on exposed arms.
      - Transitions to breakdowns, back-takes or controlled falls to top.
    - Rule: no kimura attempts from positions that sacrifice strong hip/head safety.

- “Submission is bonus” scoring
  - Priority scoring:
    - 1st: did you deny or secure points and back exposure?
    - 2nd: did you achieve or avoid dominant standing shells (rear body lock, short offence)?
    - 3rd: did you finish or threaten with a submission from structurally sound positions?
  - Coaching emphasis:
    - A “good” round is not defined by number of guillotines; it is defined by how rarely you concede clean scores and how often you turn defence into dominance.

- Mixed scenario rounds
  - Alternating roles:
    - One minute: A focuses on shots, B on defence and counters.
    - Next minute: roles reverse.
    - Track:
      - How many times did defence lead directly to short offence, rear body lock or front headlock?
      - How many submission attempts came from good structure vs desperation?


## 7.0 APPLICATION SCENARIOS

### 7.1 Opponent Turtles or Turns Away to Avoid Takedown Scoring

- Scenario
  - You attack takedown or mat return; opponent drops to turtle or partly turns away to avoid conceding clear points.
  - Common in jiu-jitsu where athletes would rather give turtle than accept clean side control or guard pass.

- Offensive priorities
  - Immediately attach to hips and upper back:
    - Hip ride, seatbelt, claw or spiral rides rather than loose over-the-top grips.
  - Use breakdown tools to remove posts:
    - Shoelace / ankle picks, spiral breakdowns, knee drives and gut-wrench-style turns.
  - Treat turtle as a “pre-back” position:
    - Aim to either:
      - Insert hooks and finish back-take, or
      - Break them to a hip or side for clear top control (strong half, side control).

- Defensive logic (if you are the turtling athlete)
  - Hands and elbows tight; no loose posts that can be spiral-ridden.
  - Use four-point stand-ups and switches as primary responses, not static turtling.
  - Accept that turtle is a temporary refuge to deny immediate points, not a long-term home.

- Training focus
  - Positional rounds starting from turtle with strict scoring:
    - Top only “wins” with hooks or 3-second top; bottom “wins” with clean stand-up or guard with no hooks/3-sec.
  - Integration with short offence and rear body lock entries from failed shots and sprawls.


### 7.2 Opponent Stands from Referee’s or Four-Point Positions

- Scenario
  - You have the opponent on hands and knees / referee’s; they attempt to stand or turn in to avoid breakdown and back exposure.
  - Extremely common after partial takedowns, scrambles and mat returns.

- Offensive priorities
  - Anticipate and “ride” their stand-up:
    - Keep hips above their hips, head over head and at least one leg controlling (shoelace, thigh pry).
  - Use stand-up attempts to create scoring:
    - As they bring a foot up, trap the near leg for mat returns or transition to body lock.
    - As they turn in, use underhook/head position to either re-take down or climb to front headlock.
  - Avoid getting dragged into pure neutral:
    - Aim to land in short offence, rear body lock or direct top control, not reset stance unless necessary.

- Defensive logic (if you are standing from bottom)
  - Build stand-ups that hide the back and minimise hook opportunities:
    - Tripod or technical stand-ups with elbows tight and head up.
  - Treat every stand-up as a race:
    - Either reach stance before they can lock body or front headlock, or bail back to guard on your terms.

- Training focus
  - “Stand-up vs mat-return” rounds:
    - Bottom only wins by getting to fully safe stance or tight guard.
    - Top only wins by mat return to 3-second top or back exposure, not just “pulling them back down once.”


### 7.3 Opponent Commits to Leg Tackles and High Singles

- Scenario
  - Opponent has strong wrestling bias; repeatedly shoots doubles, singles, high crotch, head-inside shots.
  - Typical in no-gi where many athletes anchor their whole stand-up on leg tackles.

- Defensive/offensive priorities
  - Use stance and hand-fighting to steer how they shoot:
    - Prefer them on head-inside singles or high crotch where limp-leg and short offence are strongest.
  - Deploy layered defence:
    - First layer: head and hands positioning to block clean entries.
    - Second layer: sprawls, hip drops, angle changes.
    - Third layer: limp-leg and roll-through counters.
  - Convert defence into offence:
    - From good sprawl: slide to short offence or rear body lock.
    - From limp-leg: immediate back-take, two-on-one or reshot as they stumble.

- Submission integration
  - Guilottines and front-headlock strangles only from structurally safe sprawls and head positions.
  - Leg attacks only when you have already broken posture or flattened the shot, not as first response.

- Training focus
  - Rounds where one side is “wrestler” (shots only) and the other is “jiu-jitsu standing defender”:
    - Track how often defence converts to short offence/rear body lock instead of simple stalemates.
    - Add layers: first defence only, then defence + submissions, then defence + submissions + reshots.


### 7.4 Opponent Plays Upright Judo-Style Posture or Scrambles to Feet

- Scenario
  - Opponent prefers upright, collar-focused stance, often with inside grips and hip throws in mind.
  - Or opponent frequently scrambles from ground back to feet with tall, narrow posture.

- Offensive priorities
  - Do not meet tall stance with tall stance:
    - Stay in weight-bearing, wrestling-style base while using judo-style collars as handles, not homes.
  - Target the back and waist rather than trading big throws:
    - Use arm drags, throw-bys and 2-on-1s to move behind the line of the shoulders.
    - When they turn in for uchi-mata/harai-like entries, lower hips and pivot to body lock or rear body lock.
  - Use leg grabs as “fire escapes,” not primary tools:
    - Against upright posture, enter on legs when their feet are close and shoulders over toes.
    - Aim to climb quickly from leg to waist/body lock rather than linger at the ankle/knee.

- Scramble management (when they stand from ground)
  - As they scramble up:
    - Shadow their hips, aiming to re-attach at waist or back rather than simply backing away.
    - Use collar/2-on-1/underhook combinations to re-establish advantage ties as they rise.
  - Deny them the chance to reset into their preferred tall, relaxed stance.

- Training focus
  - Rounds starting from:
    - One athlete upright judo-style, one in wrestling-style stance.
    - One athlete standing from guard or half guard, other tasked with re-attaching to hips/back.
  - Success metrics:
    - How often the wrestler-style athlete reaches body lock/rear body lock vs accepting throw battles.
    - How often the “ground” athlete allows a clean reset vs staying attached in scrambles.


## 8.0 FOUR-WEEK CURRICULUM

### 8.1 Week 1 – Positional Hierarchy, Rear Body Lock Entries and Short Offence

- Primary objectives
  - Understand and internalise the standing positional hierarchy (neutral → advantage ties → top-tier standing → aftermath).
  - Make rear body lock and short offence the default goals of hand fighting and shot defence.
  - Build basic competence in arm drags, throw-bys, and sprawl-to-short-offence transitions.

- Technical themes
  - Hierarchy orientation:
    - Map open neutral, advantage ties (2-on-1, collar/bicep, front headlock), and top-tier positions (rear body lock, short offence, strong front headlock).
    - Discuss “position before takedown” and why rear body lock / short offence are treated as standing “mount/back.”
  - Rear body lock entries:
    - Wrist–elbow arm drags from collar-and-wrist and collar-and-bicep.
    - Throw-bys / slide-bys from over/under and hard collar ties.
    - Basic consolidation: closing the lock, walking hands down, head and hip alignment behind the opponent.
  - Short offence entries:
    - Sprawl-to-short-offence from controlled singles/doubles.
    - Snapdown-to-short-offence from collar ties and front headlock.

- Suggested session structure (repeated pattern across Week 1)
  - Solo (10–15 min):
    - Stance and movement ladder (forward/back, lateral, circular).
    - Level changes and sprawl-to-stand sequences.
  - Technical (25–30 min):
    - Day 1–2: arm drags and throw-bys to rear body lock (progress from compliant to light resistance).
    - Day 3–4: sprawl-to-short-offence and snapdown-to-short-offence entries.
  - Positional sparring (15–20 min):
    - Neutral collar-and-wrist: scorer is whoever first reaches rear body lock or short offence.
    - Shot-defence rounds: B shoots, A must sprawl and arrive in short offence; reset once position is established.

- Performance checkpoints
  - Athlete can explain and draw the standing hierarchy and point to where they are in live exchanges.
  - From standard collar-and-wrist, athlete can reach rear body lock or short offence in ≤ 3 moves against light resistance.
  - From a basic single/double, athlete can reliably sprawl and arrive in short offence rather than just “flatten and reset.”


### 8.2 Week 2 – Reshots, Scoring Criteria and Breakdowns

- Primary objectives
  - Shift offensive emphasis from first shots to reshots and post-defence counters.
  - Connect short offence and rear body lock to concrete scoring criteria: hooks, 3-second top, back exposure.
  - Learn basic breakdowns and mat returns from four-point and referee’s positions.

- Technical themes
  - Reshot logic:
    - Your shot is stuffed: keep head up and hands connected, pivot and reshoot to new angle, or climb to body lock/front headlock instead of bailing.
    - You defend their shot: use sprawl and limp-leg to convert into short offence, rear body lock, or front headlock, then reshoot on their poor stance.
  - Scoring criteria and aftermath:
    - Clarify takedown, 3-second control, hooks and back-exposure rules under your target rule set.
    - Emphasise that the takedown is not “done” until aftermath is won.
  - Breakdowns from four-point / referee’s:
    - Spiral and shoelace breakdowns.
    - Basic gut-wrench/hip-turn mechanics.
    - Seatbelt and claw-based mat returns into side control, strong half, or back.

- Suggested session structure
  - Solo (10–15 min):
    - Penetration-step and reshot footwork shadow drills (double-to-double, double-to-single, sprawl-to-spin).
  - Technical (25–30 min):
    - Day 1–2: shot-to-reshot chains (double-to-reshoot, single-to-switch-leg).
    - Day 3–4: sprawl-to-go-behind and short-offence-to-breakdown; four-point breakdowns and mat returns.
  - Positional sparring (15–20 min):
    - “Reshot only” rounds: no primary shots from perfect stance; all entries must come after a stuff or defence.
    - Four-point rounds: top scores only on hooks or 3-second top; bottom scores by stand-up or guard with no score against.

- Performance checkpoints
  - Athlete can describe and execute at least two shot-to-reshot chains and two defence-to-reshot chains.
  - From four-point bottom, athlete is rarely held for a clean 3-second control in positional rounds.
  - From four-point top, athlete can consistently break opponents back down and either take the back or stabilise on top for count.


### 8.3 Week 3 – Aftermath Control and Leg-Tackle Defence

- Primary objectives
  - Make the first 3–5 seconds after impact automatic: leg stepping, hip coverage, head-over-head control.
  - Build a structured defence to singles, doubles and high crotch using sprawls, limp-leg and short-offence transitions.
  - Integrate aftermath control with the existing rear body lock and short-offence game.

- Technical themes
  - Aftermath control:
    - Leg pummelling and step-over mechanics to avoid neutral open guard after takedowns.
    - Hip coverage principles: at least one hip above/over theirs; avoid long-distance chest-on-chest.
    - Head-over-head alignment as default; correcting when head drops below theirs.
  - Leg-tackle defence:
    - Sprawl mechanics that drop hips over upper back and angle off, not just chest sprawl.
    - Limp-leg timing and direction (knee above lock, rotate out and down, then pivot to back or stance).
    - Converting defended shots into short offence and rear body lock.
  - Integration:
    - Takedown finish → immediate aftermath tree (Branches A/B/C).
    - Shot-defence → short offence/rear body lock → breakdown → aftermath.

- Suggested session structure
  - Solo (10–15 min):
    - Aftermath shadow flows: finish a “takedown” into step-over, hip coverage and head clearances.
    - Sprawl and limp-leg solo patterns (using bands or visual targets).
  - Technical (25–30 min):
    - Day 1–2: aftermath branches:
      - Facing you: step-over to half/side with head-over-head.
      - Turning away: hip-ride and back-chase with mat returns.
    - Day 3–4: leg-tackle defence:
      - Sprawl-to-short-offence.
      - Limp-leg-to-back-take or stance.
  - Positional sparring (15–20 min):
    - “Impact start” rounds: start from mid-takedown or immediately as opponent hits mat; all the work is aftermath.
    - “Wrestler vs defender” rounds: one shoots repeatedly; defender’s score is how rarely clean points/back are conceded.

- Performance checkpoints
  - After any takedown in live rounds, athlete rarely ends up in truly neutral guard; most landings lead to strong half, side, or back-chase.
  - Opponents have difficulty scoring cleanly off singles/high crotches because limp-leg and sprawl-to-short-offence come out automatically.
  - Athlete can explain which aftermath branch (A, B or C) a given scramble fell into and what the next ideal action was.


### 8.4 Week 4 – Standing Submissions and Integrated Scrimmage Rounds

- Primary objectives
  - Layer structured standing submissions on top of sound defence and positional dominance.
  - Run fully integrated scrimmage-style rounds that connect stance, ties, entries, takedowns, aftermath and submissions into one continuous system.
  - Stress-test decision rules: when to prioritise position, when to chase submission and when to exit.

- Technical themes
  - Standing submissions from defence
    - Guillotine and front-headlock strangles:
      - Only after shot is slowed and posture extended.
      - Tied to short-offence and front-headlock chains, not used as panic dives.
    - Kimuras and arm traps:
      - When arms are separated during stand-ups, turtling and failed shots.
      - Used as both submission threats and levers for breakdowns and back-takes.
    - Leg attacks:
      - Only from structurally safe situations where your neck and hips are not exposed (e.g. flattened shots, heavy sprawls).
      - Emphasis on entries that end in strong ashi, not speculative falls.
  - System integration
    - Start from stance; climb hierarchy to advantage ties and top-tier standing.
    - Use reshots and scrimmage wrestling to win aftermath.
    - Add submissions only when they align with positional advantage.

- Suggested session structure
  - Solo (10 min):
    - Review of key solo flows: stance → level changes → shots → sprawls → technical stand-ups → granby patterns.
  - Technical (20–25 min):
    - Day 1–2: guillotine/front-headlock integration with shot defence and short offence.
    - Day 3–4: kimura and selective leg-attack integration from turtling, stand-ups and sprawls.
  - Integrated scrimmage rounds (20–25 min):
    - “Score then submit” rounds:
      - Only submissions that come after a clear positional win (back, strong top) are counted; speculative submissions from bad position are penalised.
    - “System rounds”:
      - Start from stance; all tools available.
      - Post-round review: identify how many times you touched rear body lock, short offence, four-point, scrimmage aftermath and whether submissions were attempted from good or bad structure.

- Performance checkpoints
  - Athlete uses guillotines, front-headlocks, kimuras and leg attacks sparingly but effectively, almost always from strong positions.
  - In integrated rounds, athlete can move through the entire system map (stance → ties → top-tier standing → takedown → aftermath → submission or stabilisation) without major conceptual gaps.
  - Decision-making improves: fewer wild dives for submissions, more consistent choice of position-first, submission-second behaviour aligned with jiu-jitsu scoring and long-term safety.


## Annex A: Extracted Key Passages

### A.1 Core Standing Paradigm Shifts

- “We do not simply bolt wrestling on top of jiu-jitsu; we build a standing system whose aims, risks and scoring match jiu-jitsu, not folkstyle or freestyle.”
- Standing is treated as “the first phase of every jiu-jitsu match, not a different sport you play until you can finally sit down and do jiu-jitsu.”
- Dominant standing positions (rear body lock, short offence, strong front headlock) are described as “the mount and back of the upright phase.”

### A.2 Positional Hierarchy and Dominant Shells

- The athlete is urged to “spend as little time as possible in square neutral and as much as possible behind the opponent or chest-to-back.”
- Rear body lock is framed as “the gold standard of standing control; if I can put my chest on your back and lock my hands around your waist, your offence is almost gone while mine is just beginning.”
- Short offence is defined as “chest on back, my body in front of your elbows, at least one knee between us; from there you carry all the risk and I carry almost all the scoring opportunity.”

### A.3 Reshots, Not Shots, as the Engine of Takedowns

- “Most jiu-jitsu athletes will never be great at first shots, but they can all become very good at reshots if they learn to let the opponent go first.”
- A stuffed shot is reframed as “not a failure but the beginning of a chain; the question is what you do with the reactions it creates.”
- Reshots are described as “attacks on a stance that your opponent has already broken for you with their own movement.”

### A.4 Scrimmage Wrestling and Aftermath Control

- The instruction distinguishes “wrestling that decides who goes down” from “scrimmage wrestling that decides who actually scores once someone goes down.”
- “In jiu-jitsu the takedown is not finished when they hit the mat; it is finished when one of you has established control that meets the scoring criteria.”
- Athletes are repeatedly told to ask, after every exchange: “Who really won the aftermath of that takedown attempt?”

### A.5 Risk Management and Safety Filters

- High-amplitude throws are evaluated through a safety lens: “We are not trying to win the Olympics; we are trying to have healthy necks and knees after twenty years of training.”
- The preferred takedowns are described as “low-amplitude, high-control actions that put the opponent down in front of you or slightly to the side with immediate routes to pin-like control or the back.”
- Guard-pulls that concede points are criticised as “a habit that solves the short-term fear of standing at the price of long-term technical growth.”

### A.6 Defensive Philosophy and Standing Escapes

- On defence: “Your first job is not to look clever; your first job is to make yourself very difficult to score on.”
- Standing escapes and four-point stand-ups are characterised as “the missing chapter in most jiu-jitsu training; people know how to pull guard and how to play guard, but not how to stand without giving points.”
- The idea that “being taken down does not mean being scored on” is emphasised as a core mental shift.

### A.7 Submissions as Structured Counters

- Submissions in the standing phase are called “the joker in the deck; they can beat a much better wrestler but only if you play them at the right time.”
- Athletes are warned that “guillotines, kimuras and leg locks thrown from bad position are not clever tricks, they are just bad habits with good marketing.”
- The rule for submission attempts is summarised as “position, then control, then submission; not submission instead of position and control.”

### A.8 Integration with the Ground Game

- The standing system is anchored to the ground hierarchy: “Everything you do on the feet should be judged by how well it feeds your preferred ground positions.”
- Back exposure is repeatedly highlighted: “A takedown that reliably exposes the back is worth far more than a big throw that reliably lands you in open guard.”
- The entire curriculum is framed as “teaching jiu-jitsu athletes to be competent on their feet in a way that feels like jiu-jitsu, not like a second sport they must reluctantly learn.”


## Annex B: Terminology and Naming Conventions

### B.1 Standing Positional Hierarchy

- Open Neutral
  - Both athletes in stance, roughly square, with no clearly dominant grips or angles.
  - Default start position for most standing exchanges; lowest tier in the standing hierarchy.

- Advantage Ties
  - Any standing tie that offers a clear but not decisive advantage in grips or head position while still face-to-face.
  - Examples: solid 2-on-1, strong collar-and-bicep, underhook + wrist, controlled front headlock.

- Top-Tier Standing Positions
  - Standing positions that strongly favour the attacker and are intended as primary destinations.
  - In this system: standing rear body lock, chest-to-back short offence, strong front headlock with posts and knees controlled, certain dominant leg-control shells.

- Positional Hierarchy (Standing)
  - Concept that standing exchanges are arranged in tiers of advantage (Open Neutral → Advantage Ties → Top-Tier Standing → Aftermath Control), mirroring ground hierarchy thinking (guard → pin → mount/back).


### B.2 Dominant Standing Positions and Control Shells

- Rear Body Lock (Standing Rear Body Lock)
  - Attacker’s chest aligned to opponent’s back, hands locked around waist or lower torso.
  - Treated as the “gold standard” of standing dominance and primary hub for takedowns and back-takes.

- Short Offence
  - Attacker’s chest on opponent’s upper back, attacker positioned in front of opponent’s elbows, with at least one knee on the floor between them.
  - Arises from sprawls, snapdowns and front-headlock spins; treated as a scoring factory and breakdown hub.

- Front Headlock (Standing)
  - Head-and-arm or pure head control tie from the front, usually with one or both of opponent’s hands on the floor or heavily supported on the attacker.
  - In this system, primarily a transition shell that often feeds short offence, snapdowns and reshots rather than a final destination.

- Control Shell
  - Any structured grip + body alignment configuration that serves as a repeatable “hub” for offence or defence.
  - Examples: rear body lock, short offence, front headlock, 2-on-1, hip ride, four-point top breakdown positions.

- Scrimmage Position
  - Any position that arises after a takedown attempt where both athletes are fighting over scoring criteria (hooks, hip-and-shoulder contact, stand-ups) rather than simply who goes down.
  - Includes four-point, referee’s, seated guard recoveries, and many aftermath scrambles.


### B.3 Takedown and Aftermath Language

- Primary Shot
  - A takedown attempt launched directly from neutral stance without prior structural compromise of opponent’s stance.
  - Treated as high-risk, especially for non-wrestlers.

- Reshot
  - A takedown attempt launched immediately after a previous shot or defence has compromised stance or posture.
  - Central engine of this system: “go second and win” philosophy.

- Aftermath
  - The 3–5 second window following impact where it is decided who actually scores, who gains back exposure, and who stands or escapes.
  - Explicitly separated conceptually from the initial takedown event.

- Mat Return
  - Any action where the top athlete brings a partially standing or escaping opponent back down to the mat while maintaining or improving control.
  - Includes waist-lock lifts, hip rides with trips, and seatbelt-based drag-downs.

- Breakdown
  - Actions used from four-point/referee’s or short offence to remove posts and collapse structure (spiral, shoelace, gut-wrench, cradle, seatbelt trips).
  - The bridge between control shells and scoring positions (back, stable top).

- Impact Branches
  - The categorisation of aftermath scenarios based on how the opponent hits the mat: facing you (guard-facing), turning away/turtling, on side/seated, or pulling guard/entangling.


### B.4 Scoring and Position Terms

- 3-Second Control (Stabilisation Count)
  - Operational definition of when “control” has been established sufficiently for scoring under common jiu-jitsu rule sets (e.g. takedown, pass, mount).
  - Used in this system as a practical criterion: if you cannot hold for ~3 seconds, you treat the position as not fully “won.”

- Back Exposure
  - Situations where the opponent’s back is significantly turned away and available for hooks, seatbelt or chest-to-back control.
  - Considered a higher-value scoring reward than many standard takedowns.

- Stable Top
  - Any top position where the attacker’s head and hips are structurally dominant (head over head/shoulder line, hip over hip) and the opponent’s movement options are constrained.
  - Includes strong half guard top, side control, mount-like shells, and some body-lock holds.

- Hooks
  - Foot/leg insertions around the opponent’s hips or thighs that, combined with upper-body control, define classical back control.
  - The presence or absence of hooks is treated as a major scoring marker in back-taking sequences.

- Takedown Score vs Takedown Event
  - Takedown event: the moment one athlete brings another to the mat.
  - Takedown score: only awarded (conceptually) when aftermath control meets the criteria (stable top or back exposure) long enough to count.


### B.5 Defensive and Escape Terminology

- Standing Escape Game
  - The organised collection of movements (sprawls, limp-legs, four-point stand-ups, hip-heists, Granby/sit-outs) used to avoid conceding points or hooks when defending takedowns.

- Four-Point Position
  - Bottom position with hands and knees on the mat; hips roughly inline or slightly above knees, head not yet trapped.
  - For top player: key breakdown hub. For bottom player: launching pad for stand-ups and Granby/sit-out escapes.

- Referee’s Position
  - Variants of four-point often used in wrestling rules: bottom athlete with one knee up, one knee down, hands or elbows on mat; attacker controlling from behind or side.
  - Used functionally here as a family label for similar structures.

- Technical Stand-Up
  - Structured stand-up mechanic where one foot plants, opposite hand posts, and the other leg swings back to build stance with head and hands protected.
  - Preferred over chaotic scramble stands that expose the back.

- Hip Heist
  - Sharp lateral or rotational movement that re-positions the hips from under the opponent’s weight to a more neutral or advantageous line, often used during stand-ups or escapes from top pressure.

- Granby / Shoulder Roll
  - Rolling escape over one shoulder to create space and reverse angles, especially from four-point, turtle and some rear-control scenarios.
  - Used as a higher-risk but powerful tool against overcommitted top pressure.


### B.6 Submission Integration Terms

- Standing Submissions
  - Submissions initiated or primarily controlled while both athletes are at least partially standing.
  - In this system: guillotines, front-headlock strangles, kimuras, some leg attacks and triangles that arise from shot defence and scrambles.

- Joker in the Deck
  - Metaphor for submissions in the standing phase: powerful equaliser against better wrestlers, but dangerous if played at the wrong time.
  - Implies they must be integrated only after structural control is attained.

- Structured Counter (Submission)
  - Submission used as an extension of sound defence and positional dominance rather than as a blind, desperate attack.
  - Example: guillotine after controlled sprawl and head-extension, not as a forward-falling, off-balance dive.

- Emergency Submission
  - Submissions thrown from poor structure and risk positions (e.g. being run down on a double, head buried).
  - Explicitly de-emphasised: labelled as last-resort and discouraged as habitual strategy.


### B.7 Training and Drill Language

- Scrimmage Round
  - A sparring round structured to emphasise aftermath phases: takedown impact, mat returns, breakdowns, stand-ups and back exposure.
  - Scoring and feedback are based more on aftermath and control than on initial takedown entries.

- Constraint Round
  - Round in which rules are artificially restricted to train particular behaviours (e.g. reshots only, no primary shots; no guard-pulls; must enter rear body lock before takedown).

- Chain
  - Fixed sequence of interconnected moves (e.g. defend shot → short offence → go-behind → breakdown → hooks) drilled as a unit until behaviour becomes automatic.

- Branch / Node (Flowchart Language)
  - “Nodes” are decision points in the system (e.g. “Your shot is stuffed”, “They turtle”, “They stand from four-point”).
  - “Branches” are the paths taken from each node (e.g. “Reshot”, “Breakdown to four-point”, “Stand-up to stance”).

- A-Game Tree
  - Athlete-specific subset of the total system that they choose to specialise in: preferred entries, control shells, takedowns, and submissions arranged as a personalised tree.


## Annex C: Additional Structural and Integration Notes

### C.1 Relationship to Standing2Ground 1: Takedowns & Standing Skills

- Series linkage
  - Standing2Ground 1 (S2G1 – Takedowns & Standing Skills) emphasises stance, foundational entries, leg tackles and body locks with a strong focus on mechanics and risk-aware finishes.
  - Standing2Ground – Positional Dominance & Scrimmage Wrestling (this instructional) assumes those mechanics and layers a higher-order framework of positional hierarchy, scrimmage wrestling and aftermath control on top.
- Division of labour
  - S2G1 answers “How do I physically enter and finish takedowns safely for jiu-jitsu?”
  - This instructional answers “How do I structure the standing phase and aftermath so I consistently win scoring, back exposure and scrambles, even against better wrestlers?”
- Practical integration
  - For athletes new to the series, S2G1 should normally be prioritised for raw mechanics; S2G Positional Dominance is then used to organise those mechanics into a full standing game.
  - For advanced athletes, both instructionals can be trained in parallel: S2G1 drills in warm-ups and early technical segments, S2G Positional Dominance concepts and scrimmage rounds in later, higher-intensity segments.

### C.2 Integration with the Unified `SYS/` Standup Domain

- System extraction
  - Core elements to be promoted into `SYS/standup/`:
    - Standing positional hierarchy (neutral → advantage ties → top-tier standing → aftermath).
    - Rear body lock and short offence as primary standup system pages (purpose, key cues, entries, finishes, drills).
    - Scrimmage wrestling and aftermath control as their own pages (impact branches, mat returns, breakdowns, stand-ups).
    - Leg-tackle defence (sprawl, limp leg, switches) and standing submissions as supporting pages.
- Avoiding duplication
  - Per Kano Scroll/Jigoro rules, `SYS/` should contain only abstracted, cross-instructional systems:
    - Techniques and details that are highly specific to this instructional can remain in `INS/s2g-posdom/VN/` and sessions.
    - `SYS/` entries reference “see INS/s2g-*/VN vX” for volume-specific variations and examples.
- Tagging and navigation
  - Within `SYS/standup/`, standup pages should include references such as:
    - “Derived from: INS/s2g1 (Takedowns & Standing Skills), INS/s2g-posdom (Positional Dominance & Scrimmage Wrestling).”
  - This allows future instructionals (e.g. upper-body throws, cage wrestling) to plug into the same standup skeleton without rewriting system pages.

### C.3 Session Design and Block Planning Implications

- Block structure
  - A typical 12-session block for this instructional should:
    - Start with hierarchy orientation and rear body lock/short offence entries (Sessions 01–04).
    - Move into reshots, four-point breakdowns and mat returns (Sessions 05–08).
    - End with aftermath control, leg-tackle defence and standing submissions integrated scrimmage rounds (Sessions 09–12).
- Layering with S2G1 content
  - Within each session, the “mechanics first, strategy second” rule applies:
    - First 15–20 min: technical refresh from S2G1 (stance, shots, body lock entries, basic doubles/singles).
    - Next 20–25 min: positional dominance material (hierarchy, rear body lock, short offence, scrimmage and aftermath).
    - Last 15–20 min: constrained sparring and scrimmage rounds that force application of positional/aftermath concepts under fatigue.
- Emphasis for different athlete types
  - Pure guard players:
    - Prioritise defensive hierarchy (standing escapes, four-point stand-ups, leg-tackle defence, guard entry without conceding points).
    - Use this instructional primarily to stop bleeding points and back exposure when forced to stand.
  - Wrestler crossovers:
    - Emphasise aftermath control, back-exposure scoring and submission integration.
    - Use this instructional to “jiu-jitsu-ise” existing wrestling skills so they stop giving backs, necks and legs for free.

### C.4 Integration with Sparring and Competition Prep

- Standing-only and half-scrimmage rounds
  - Weekly template:
    - One session anchored by standing-only and standup-to-scrimmage rounds.
    - Specific constraints: no guard pulls that concede points; must pass through advantage ties/top-tier standing before takedowns; points only awarded on aftermath (hooks/3s control).
  - Periodisation:
    - Early in camp: higher volume of constrained technical rounds (reshots only, short-offence-only, rear body lock-only branches).
    - Late in camp: more open scrimmage where full system is available but coaching feedback still anchored to hierarchy and aftermath metrics.
- Competition rehearsal
  - For athletes preparing for competition:
    - Integrate rule-set specifics: IBJJF vs ADCC vs sub-only nuances around guard pulls and back exposure.
    - Ensure stand-up drilling includes common competitive behaviours:
      - Opponents turtling to avoid scores.
      - Opponents forcing out-of-bounds resets.
      - Opponents playing ultra-defensive open guard to stall aftermath.
  - Video review:
    - Tag competition footage using the system’s language:
      - “Here you stayed in open neutral too long.”
      - “Here you won takedown event but lost aftermath.”
      - “Here you had rear body lock but chose low-value finish instead of back-exposure chain.”

### C.5 Data Capture, Review and Iteration

- Metrics to track
  - During sparring blocks, track:
    - Number of times you reach rear body lock per round.
    - Number of times you reach short offence per round.
    - Ratio of takedown events you initiate vs takedown scores you actually secure.
    - Number of times opponents score on you after you shoot (lost aftermath), and vice versa.
  - For leg-tackle defence:
    - Frequency of clean scores against you off singles/doubles over a 4–6 week period.
    - Frequency of successful limp-leg-to-back or sprawl-to-short-offence counters.
- Review cadence
  - End-of-block review (every 12 sessions):
    - Identify which hierarchy tiers are underused (e.g. rarely reaching rear body lock).
    - Identify which impact branches routinely fail (e.g. always losing Branch A – facing-you aftermath).
    - Decide which elements should be promoted to `SYS/` and which should remain local to this instructional.
  - Ongoing micro-adjustments:
    - Revise personal A-game trees (entries, shells, finishes) every 4–6 weeks based on live performance, not preference alone.
- Feedback loop to `SYS/`
  - Wherever certain drills or chains consistently produce good results across partners and blocks, they should be:
    - Documented concisely in `SYS/standup/…` pages.
    - Tagged with their origin (“from S2G Positional Dominance, Vol X”) but described generically enough to be reusable with other instructionals and training sources.

### C.6 Dependencies and Future Expansion

- Upstream dependencies
  - Requires at least baseline familiarity with:
    - S2G1 stance, shots, basic body locks and finishes.
    - Fundamental ground hierarchy (guard, side control, mount, back).
    - Basic guard retention and top control so aftermath positions make sense.
- Downstream expansion
  - Future instructionals may add:
    - Cage/wall wrestling adaptations of the same hierarchy.
    - Gi-specific grips (collar, sleeve, belt) that implement identical positional logic.
    - Specialised standup systems for rule variants (e.g. no-guard-pull formats).
- Stability vs evolution
  - The core ideas—hierarchy, rear body lock, short offence, reshots, aftermath control—are intended as stable pillars.
  - Technique details (specific finishes, entries, submission recipes) can evolve as new material is added; the positional map remains the spine around which all future updates are organised.

### D.3 System Heuristics (Compact)

- Standing goals
  - Leave OPEN NEUTRAL quickly.
  - Live in ADVANTAGE TIES and TOP-TIER STANDING (rear body lock, short offence).
  - Use TAKEDOWNS and MAT RETURNS only as bridges to AFTERMATH CONTROL (back, stable top).

- Offensive heuristics
  - “Win hands and head, then win position, then win takedown, then win aftermath.”
  - Reshots beat first shots; let them break their own stance, then go.
  - Rear body lock and short offence are destinations, not afterthoughts.

- Defensive heuristics
  - Being taken down ≠ being scored on; aftermath decides who really won.
  - Guard-pull that gives points is last resort, not default.
  - First defend structure (neck, hips), then stand or reverse, then consider submissions.

- Submission heuristics
  - Submissions are the joker: powerful but must be played late in the hand.
  - Control first, posture second, submission third.
  - Any submission that trades away clear positional dominance for a 50/50 scramble is usually a bad trade under this system.

## Annex E: Common Failure Patterns & Corrective Cues

### E.1 Stuck in Open Neutral and “Shadow Wrestling”

- Failure pattern
  - Long stretches of square, low-value collar-tie hand fighting with very few transitions to advantage ties or top-tier standing.
  - Athlete feels “busy” but rarely reaches rear body lock, short offence or real scoring scrambles.

- Likely causes
  - No clear mental map of the standing hierarchy.
  - Over-attachment to favourite grip (e.g. collar tie) instead of treating it as a transient handle.
  - Fear of exposing themselves by committing to entries or positional upgrades.

- Corrective cues
  - “Every grip should be going somewhere.” – If you cannot name where your current tie leads (2-on-1, back, short offence), change it.
  - “No more than 3–5 seconds in pure neutral.” – In sparring, force yourself to attempt an upgrade (tie, angle, snap) within a few beats of contact.
  - Use constrained rounds:
    - Rule: no shots from pure neutral; you must first achieve an advantage tie or back/short-offence entry before any leg attack.


### E.2 Shooting From Raw Neutral with Poor Setup

- Failure pattern
  - Athlete repeatedly attempts long-range doubles/singles from square stance with minimal grip or head-position preparation.
  - Opponents easily sprawl, counter-attack guillotines/kimuras or simply shuck the shot and take angles.

- Likely causes
  - Carry-over from generic wrestling drills that start from “ready, go” without realistic hand fighting.
  - Misunderstanding of jiu-jitsu risk profile: undervaluing submission exposure and aftermath scrambles.

- Corrective cues
  - “Earn your shot with your hands.” – No leg attack unless:
    - You have a meaningful tie (2-on-1, underhook, collar + bicep) or
    - Opponent’s stance is obviously broken (post-shot, bad stand-up).
  - Replace primary-shot rounds with reshot-only rounds:
    - You can only attack legs after a previous shot or defence has compromised stance.
  - In technical drilling:
    - Add a 3–5-touch hand-fighting sequence before every scripted shot so entries never come from static neutral.


### E.3 Ignoring Rear Body Lock and Short Offence Opportunities

- Failure pattern
  - Athlete frequently creates angles, arm drags, snapdowns or sprawls but does not convert to rear body lock or short offence.
  - Instead, they either reset to neutral or cling to low-yield ties (collar-only, front headlock with poor structure).

- Likely causes
  - Lack of clarity that rear body lock and short offence are intended as primary destinations.
  - Over-fascination with front headlock/submission attempts at the expense of positional dominance.

- Corrective cues
  - “If you can see their back, you should be on it.” – Any time you glimpse the back, default intention is to seal rear body lock or short offence.
  - “Front headlock is a corridor, not a room.” – Use it to move to back/short offence or breakdowns, not to live in.
  - Constrain rounds:
    - Rule: you must try to reach rear body lock or short offence at least once every exchange.
    - No direct submissions from front headlock unless you first touch short offence or a breakdown position.


### E.4 Winning the Takedown Event but Losing the Aftermath

- Failure pattern
  - Athlete completes takedowns (opponent hits the mat) but:
    - Opponent immediately stands, sweeps, or re-guards.
    - No 3-second top control or back exposure is achieved.
  - Athlete has a high “takedown count” but low competitive scoring impact.

- Likely causes
  - Overemphasis on the entry and finish, underemphasis on leg pummels, hip coverage and head-over-head.
  - Lack of clear aftermath branching: athlete does not know what Branch A/B/C they are in on impact.

- Corrective cues
  - “The takedown isn’t done until someone can count to three.” – Do not mentally tick ‘success’ at the moment of impact.
  - “Legs, hips, head – in that order.” – After impact:
    - First: sort the legs (step-over, staple, pummel).
    - Second: fix hip line (hip over hip).
    - Third: correct head position (head over head/shoulder).
  - Use impact-start rounds:
    - Start every exchange with partner already mid-fall in one of the three aftermath branches.
    - Score only on who wins the aftermath, not who would have “got the takedown.”


### E.5 Over-Reliance on Guard Pulls that Concede Points

- Failure pattern
  - Athlete habitually falls to guard from standing, often after weak engagement, and concedes takedown points or advantageous starts.
  - Pulls are used as a default “escape” from standing instead of as deliberate, structured attacks.

- Likely causes
  - Underdeveloped standing escape and stand-up game.
  - Fear of leg tackles and lack of confidence in scrimmage and aftermath phases.
  - Training environment that does not penalise guard pulls with points.

- Corrective cues
  - “Guard pull is a weapon, not a surrender.” – Only pull guard when:
    - You have a strong collar/arm configuration, and
    - The pull directly generates off-balances, sweeps or submissions.
  - “Stand first, sit on your terms later.” – Build four-point stand-ups and limp-leg escapes as primary responses; guard pull becomes backup, not first choice.
  - Use scoring constraints:
    - In sparring, treat non-attacking guard pulls as giving up 2 points and bad grip; force the athlete to pay the competitive cost.


### E.6 Being Too Easy to Score On After Being Taken Down

- Failure pattern
  - Athlete is taken down and almost always gives up:
    - Clean 3-second top control, and/or
    - Hooks and back exposure.
  - Even “good defence” still results in points for the opponent.

- Likely causes
  - Little focus on aftermath defence and stand-ups; training stops once back touches the mat.
  - No explicit knowledge of scoring criteria and how to deny them in scrambles.

- Corrective cues
  - “If you went down, the job just started.” – Your priority after being taken down:
    - Deny hooks.
    - Deny 3-second pin-style control.
    - Get to four-point / stand-up, not flop to long-distance guard.
  - Drill reverse-impact rounds:
    - Start with you already mid-fall, down on hips or side.
    - Objective: stand or reach robust guard without allowing 3-second control.
  - Teach “panic rules”:
    - Always fight first for frames and lateral hip movement, not grips for submissions.
    - If you cannot see them, first get to a position where you can (turn in or controlled turtle).


### E.7 Submissions as Panic Reactions During Takedown Defence

- Failure pattern
  - Athlete dives for guillotines, kimuras or leg locks from structurally poor positions:
    - Head buried under hips.
    - Hips extended and off-balance.
  - High number of failed submissions → conceded takedowns, back-takes and passes.

- Likely causes
  - Mis-learning from highlight reels and social media clips.
  - Lack of clarity on “safe conditions” for standing submissions.

- Corrective cues
  - “Control first, then submit.” – Ask:
    - Is my head safe?
    - Are my hips safe?
    - Is his posture compromised?
    - If not, no submission.
  - Label emergency submissions:
    - Identify specific positions where a guillotine or kimura is truly last-resort; drill them explicitly as such and not as primary options.
  - Constraint rounds:
    - “Position-submission rule”:
      - Submissions are only allowed if you first achieved a top-tier standing position or a clear aftermath advantage.
      - Any submission from bad structure automatically counts as ‘minus’ in review.


### E.8 Underdeveloped Standing Escape Game and Four-Point Stand-Ups

- Failure pattern
  - Once grounded or turtled, athlete:
    - Either stays static and waits for pass/back-take, or
    - Rolls chaotically to guard, often giving up points and bad grips.
  - Rarely stands or recovers stance without conceding major advantage.

- Likely causes
  - Training culture that emphasises guard retention over stand-ups.
  - Limited drilling of four-point stand-up and technical stand-up specifically in scrimmage contexts.

- Corrective cues
  - “Your feet are still an option.” – In turtle/four-point:
    - First think: can I safely stand?
    - Only then: can I safely guard?
  - Make stand-ups mandatory in positional rounds:
    - For a training block, bottom player from four-point/referee’s can only “win” by standing, not by pulling guard.
  - Break stand-ups into simple rules:
    - Elbows tight → knee under chest → head up → post foot → face opponent as you stand.


### E.9 Over-Complicating Entries, Under-Developing A-Game Chains

- Failure pattern
  - Athlete knows many different entries and finishes but:
    - Does not hit any one of them consistently.
    - Changes plan mid-exchange due to overload of options.
  - In practice, live game looks messy and reactive.

- Likely causes
  - Over-consumption of content without consolidation.
  - No explicit A-game tree chosen or documented.

- Corrective cues
  - “Pick 2–3 trees and grow them.” – For a full block:
    - Choose 1–2 entries to rear body lock.
    - Choose 1 short-offence entry and 1 breakdown.
    - Choose 1–2 reshot chains.
  - Document personal chains:
    - E.g. “Collar & wrist → arm drag → rear body lock → reverse trip → half guard top.”
    - Drill these chains in high volume until they become default behaviours.
  - Use “chain rounds”:
    - Only score attempts that follow your pre-declared chain; random techniques don’t count.


### E.10 Poor Rule-Set Awareness and Misaligned Strategy

- Failure pattern
  - Athlete uses behaviours that make sense in one rule-set but are costly in another:
    - E.g. casual guard pulls in point-scoring formats.
    - Overcommitting to submissions in sub-only without positional awareness.
  - Frequent surprise at actual scoring outcomes in competition.

- Likely causes
  - Standup training done in a rules vacuum.
  - No explicit mapping from instructional concepts to the athlete’s target rule-set.

- Corrective cues
  - “Train how you’re scored.” – At least part of each week’s standup training must:
    - Use the same scoring and guard-pull rules as your target events.
  - Build a rule-set overlay:
    - For IBJJF-style: emphasise denying points on guard-pulls and takedowns, heavy focus on 3s control and hooks.
    - For ADCC-style: emphasise late-match standup strategy, avoiding penalties, and back-exposure rules.
  - Debrief standing exchanges:
    - After rounds, quickly label each key exchange:
      - “Who would have scored?”
      - “Did the aftermath match our goals?”
