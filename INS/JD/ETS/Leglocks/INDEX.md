# ETS Leg Locks (Danaher)

## Purpose
Study and train John Danaher’s *Enter the System – Leg Locks* using the Kano Scroll workflow:
- [B] BIO → VN extraction → sessions → promote durable items to `SYS/`.

## Links
- BIO: `./bio-ets-ll.md`
- Viewing Notes:
  - `./VN/v1.md`
  - `./VN/v2.md`
  - `./VN/v3.md`
  - `./VN/v4.md`
  - `./VN/v5.md`
  - `./VN/v6.md`
  - `./VN/v7.md`
  - `./VN/v8.md`
- Sessions (12): `./sessions/`
- Transcripts (raw): `./transcripts/`
- Volume index (timestamps): `./INDEX.md`

## Repo layout
- `bio-ets-ll.md` = BIO (authoritative overview)
- `VN/` = volume-based viewing notes (extraction + tagging)
- `sessions/` = 12-session block (S01–S12)
- `transcripts/` = raw sources (keep unchanged)

## Operating rule
- Technical content in VN/sessions/SYS must be derived from transcript and/or BIO unless explicitly requested otherwise.
