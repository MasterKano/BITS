# VIEWING NOTES — ETS Leg Locks

## 1.0 Volume 1

### 1.1 Introduction (0:00–1:54)
- Key concepts
  - This is a *system* approach to leg locks (not a loose collection of moves): start from initial contact and progress through control → entry → finish.
  - Leg locks are presented as part of a unified grappling strategy (not a separate “side game”).
- Position–structure
  - The instructional frame starts from standing/seated interaction and builds into entanglement-based control (ashi garami family).
- Key cues
  - Think in “skills” and “phases” (how you progress reliably), not memorized sequences.
- Drills
  - None (orientation/intent-setting chapter).
- System tags
  - leg lock framework; phases; skill-based learning

### 1.2 Breakdown (1:54–9:05)
- Key concepts
  - Breaking mechanics rely on leverage: work at the end of the lever (long lever arm), not the short end.
  - Fulcrum quality matters:
    - **Hardness**: prefer bony/hard surfaces over soft muscle when using a fulcrum.
    - **Height**: increasing fulcrum height increases breaking effect.
- Position–structure
  - Principle is illustrated with familiar upper-body breaking mechanics (armbar) then mapped back onto leg lock breaking.
- Key cues
  - Seek maximum lever length before you apply finishing force.
  - Upgrade your fulcrum: hard + high beats soft + low.
- Drills
  - “Fulcrum upgrade” reps: demonstrate same breaking configuration with a soft fulcrum vs a hard fulcrum, then repeat with intentional “raise the fulcrum” mechanics.
- System tags
  - breaking mechanics; lever/fulcrum; finishing principles

### 1.3 Explication (9:05–10:56)
- Key concepts
  - **Wedges** are the dominant immobilization tool in jiu-jitsu (more reliable than “bodyweight pinning” alone).
  - Wedges function like inclined planes in physics: they block movement directionally.
  - Immobilization is not “cementing” an opponent; it is preventing their preferred movement pathways.
- Position–structure
  - Demonstration: “pin” effectiveness increases dramatically when wedges are introduced (even without hands).
- Key cues
  - If you want real control, build wedges first; add weight second.
  - Test control by removing hands: if the opponent can still move, your wedge structure is missing.
- Drills
  - Hands-behind-back pin test: top person pins chest-to-chest with hands removed; bottom escapes → add a wedge under one side → test again.
- System tags
  - wedges; immobilization; control diagnostics

### 1.4 Independant Thinking (10:56–12:15)
- Key concepts
  - The goal is to think independently in principles: wedges change outcomes even when “traditional pinning” looks identical.
  - Reinforced control = wedges + reinforcement (weight or mechanical locking).
- Position–structure
  - Compare: pin without wedges vs pin with a wedge under one side; movement options change radically.
- Key cues
  - Ask “what changed mechanically?” rather than “what move did I do?”
  - Identify the wedge(s) before you chase pressure.
- Drills
  - Wedge/no-wedge contrast rounds (short): repeat the same top position with and without a wedge; bottom tries to recover guard.
- System tags
  - principle-first learning; wedge reinforcement; control troubleshooting

### 1.5 Overview (12:15–15:20)
- Key concepts
  - Ashi garami is a wedge-based control system that typically **cannot** be reinforced by bodyweight the way conventional pins are.
  - In leg entanglements, reinforcement is usually mechanical: leg locking/triangles/squeezes that stabilize the wedge structure.
  - Bottom position demands strong control concepts because weight is not available as the primary stabilizer.
- Position–structure
  - Ashi is framed as: create wedges around opponent’s legs/hips → reinforce wedges mechanically → off-balance → finish.
- Key cues
  - Treat entanglements as “pins without weight”: your legs must do the stabilizing work.
  - Prioritize immobilization before submission effort.
- Drills
  - “Ashi without weight” stability drill: hold an entanglement while partner attempts to rotate/withdraw; focus on leg locking mechanics (not submissions).
- System tags
  - ashi reinforcement; bottom control; wedge-based pinning

### 1.6 Manifestations of Leg Lock System (15:20–18:41)
- Key concepts
  - Effective immobilization generally requires wedges on **both sides** of the body (bilateral wedge logic).
  - Leg locking here is presented primarily through ashi-garami structures, but “leg locks” as a category can exist outside ashi.
  - Establish precision: define the system boundaries and the essential skill set needed for reliable heel-hooking outcomes.
- Position–structure
  - System architecture: overall leg lock system → sub-systems (ashi families) → core skills for control-to-finish.
- Key cues
  - Build bilateral control: if the opponent can turn freely toward an “open side,” your wedge system is incomplete.
- Drills
  - “Two-side wedge check”: partner tries to rotate both directions; you must block both with wedge positioning before attempting any finish.
- System tags
  - bilateral wedges; system architecture; heel hook skill stack

### 1.7 Grip and Inside Position (18:41–22:38)
- Key concepts
  - High-percentage leg locking is strongly associated with heel hooks and structured ashi positions.
  - The system is organized into three main ashi families (subsystems) to simplify a large body of information:
    - Straight ashi family (centerline-oriented)
    - Cross ashi family
    - Reverse ashi family
  - Inside positioning (feet/knees/legs) is emphasized as foundational to successful entanglement control.
- Position–structure
  - Ashi definition: your two legs control one of the opponent’s legs; positional advantage comes from 2-on-1 via leg structure.
  - Centerline language: many ashi variations are defined by how your legs align relative to the opponent’s centerline.
- Key cues
  - Learn the *family* first, then the variations inside the family.
  - Inside position is a default orientation to win entanglement battles.
- Drills
  - “Family recognition” reps: partner feeds three common entanglement looks; you name the family and correct your alignment to centerline.
- System tags
  - ashi families; inside position; centerline alignment

### 1.8 Gripping (22:38–26:43)
- Key concepts
  - Nothing meaningful happens until you establish a working grip: control precedes offense.
  - Gripping is framed as a universal gateway skill across sparring/competition contexts.
  - Start from seated/butterfly contexts as a practical learning environment for bottom entries.
- Position–structure
  - Gripping is connected to inside positioning: hands initiate control; legs complete the entanglement.
- Key cues
  - Grip for a purpose (control, off-balance, openings), not “grip collecting.”
  - Establish grips that survive break attempts long enough to create a second action.
- Drills
  - Seated grip-entry flow: start seated; achieve first working grip; partner tries to disengage; you maintain and advance to next control.
- System tags
  - gripping gateways; bottom entry setup; control-first

### 1.9 2 on 1 Gripping (22:38–33:25)
- Key concepts
  - Every grip has a **weak zone** (identified by thumb direction); escapes occur through the weak zone.
  - 2-on-1 gripping covers the weak zone by using opposing thumb directions.
  - Do not “fight pull with pull”: move with the opponent’s pull to retain grips and shorten the effective lever they’re using.
- Position–structure
  - 2-on-1 principle applies broadly (wrist grips, elbow grips, leg grips): one hand establishes, the second hand seals the weakness.
- Key cues
  - Opponent pulls away → you move with the pull (body follows) → your structure stays connected.
  - Thumbs point opposite directions when you want a high-retention 2-on-1.
- Drills
  - Weak-zone escape test: partner tries to extract through thumb-direction; you add the second hand and re-test.
  - “Move with pull” drill: partner explosively yanks back; you follow and re-square while keeping connection.
- System tags
  - 2-on-1 grips; weak-zone coverage; grip retention mechanics

### 1.10 Immovable Elbow (33:25–39:00)
- Key concepts
  - Convert grips into **structures** by connecting elbows to hips (immovable elbow concept).
  - Retain connection by dissipating force: don’t resist; follow the pull while keeping elbows anchored.
  - The 2-on-1 principle extends from wrists to elbows: elbow control can be higher-value for steering posture and denying access.
- Position–structure
  - Grip → elbows to hips → hips/feet support the connection → opponent’s pull becomes less effective.
- Key cues
  - If your elbow floats, your grip becomes “arms-only” and breaks easily.
  - Keep elbows tight; let your whole body move rather than isolating the arms.
- Drills
  - Elbow-to-hip retention reps: partner yanks; you maintain elbow-to-hip connection while stepping/scooting to follow.
  - Elbow-grip steering: from seated, use elbow grip to force hands forward/down without losing structure.
- System tags
  - immovable elbow; structure building; retention vs grip breaks

### 1.11 Push Pull Dynamic (39:00–42:38)
- Key concepts
  - Add your legs as “engines” to multiply upper-body grip effectiveness.
  - Push–pull creates the feeling of disproportionate strength: legs drive while hands guide.
  - Gripping must transition into effect: off-balance, forced steps, or forced posts.
- Position–structure
  - Seated/butterfly framing: hands attach; feet and hooks assist (push off floor, adjust distance, create opponent reactions).
- Key cues
  - Pull with the arms while your legs supply the power (push/drive/scoot).
  - Watch for stepping responses: forced steps often create the moment for entry.
- Drills
  - Seated push–pull: partner stands and pulls away; you follow and then actively drive to force a step or post.
- System tags
  - push–pull; kuzushi creation; entry timing

### 1.12 Torso Controls (42:38–46:22)
- Key concepts
  - Grips have a “negative” function (stop opponent’s offense) and a “positive” function (create openings to attack).
  - Torso control is a bridge from hand-fighting to leg entry: force posts, force steps, and force hip angles.
- Position–structure
  - Upgrade from limb-only control to controlling the opponent’s torso orientation (shoulder line / hip line).
- Key cues
  - If you can steer the torso, the legs become easier to isolate.
  - Use torso control to create predictable reactions (post/step) that expose legs.
- Drills
  - Seated torso-steering reps: partner tries to square up and back away; you steer shoulders/torso to force a post or step, then reset.
- System tags
  - torso control; reaction creation; entry setup

### 1.13 Hand Over Shoulders (46:22–52:23)
- Key concepts
  - Shoulder-line control can be established with hand position over/around shoulders to limit posture and rotation.
  - Shoulder control links directly to kuzushi: if the shoulders are compromised, stepping becomes reactive and predictable.
- Position–structure
  - From seated/butterfly distance, hands climb to higher control points (shoulders/upper torso) to steer balance.
- Key cues
  - Control the “steering wheel” (shoulders) to control the “wheels” (steps).
  - Prevent the opponent from squaring their shoulders before you attempt leg entry.
- Drills
  - Shoulder-control off-balance: establish shoulder control, force a step, then release and reset (no entry yet).
- System tags
  - shoulder-line control; kuzushi; steering

### 1.14 2 on 1 Leg (52:23–56:49)
- Key concepts
  - Transition the 2-on-1 concept from arms to legs: isolate one leg with two points of control.
  - Control targets can be layered: ankle + knee line, or ankle + hip connection depending on distance.
- Position–structure
  - Seated/butterfly context: hands connect to a leg while legs position to prevent withdrawal and maintain inside alignment.
- Key cues
  - Treat the captured leg as a “handle” for off-balancing and entry.
  - If the opponent can freely retract the knee, your control is too low/too loose.
- Drills
  - 2-on-1 leg capture: partner stands; you secure 2-on-1 on one leg; partner tries to yank free; maintain connection for 10 seconds then reset.
- System tags
  - 2-on-1 leg; isolation; entry precursor

### 1.15 Shin To Shin (56:49–1:00:51)
- Key concepts
  - Shin-to-shin is a key connector position for entering leg entanglements from seated guard.
  - It supports inside positioning and helps keep the opponent’s leg “in range” as they attempt to step away.
- Position–structure
  - Your shin frames against their shin; hands/other leg reinforce distance and alignment for entry.
- Key cues
  - Keep your shin connection active; don’t let the opponent clear the line by stepping wide.
  - Use shin contact to manage distance and timing for the next connection (e.g., to ashi).
- Drills
  - Shin-to-shin retention: partner tries to step out; you maintain shin contact and re-square; reset after 5–10 seconds.
- System tags
  - shin-to-shin; connector hub; distance management

### 1.16 Standing Opponent (1:00:51–1:05:33)
- Key concepts
  - Against a standing opponent, your grips must create predictable reactions (posts/steps) before you attempt entry.
  - Distance management becomes primary: too far and you lose connection; too close and you get collapsed.
- Position–structure
  - Seated guard engagement vs standing: hands establish first connection; legs frame and steer.
- Key cues
  - Maintain connection while adjusting your hips rather than reaching with arms.
  - Use reactions (step/post) as the trigger to enter, not “hope entries.”
- Drills
  - Reaction-timing rounds: start seated vs standing; goal is to force one clear reaction (post/step) and freeze; reset.
- System tags
  - seated vs standing; reaction triggers; distance control

### 1.17 Scoop Gripping (1:05:33–1:11:16)
- Key concepts
  - Scoop-style grips can improve retention on the leg by changing the direction the opponent must pull to escape.
  - Scoop grips help connect your hands to your torso/hips (structure), not just to the opponent’s limb.
- Position–structure
  - Hand shape and placement increase control quality on the lower leg while you reposition for entry.
- Key cues
  - Scoop and attach to your body; don’t hold the leg with “arms only.”
  - Follow the pull while maintaining scoop shape and contact.
- Drills
  - Scoop retention: partner yanks their leg free repeatedly; you maintain scoop and follow; reset after 3 attempts.
- System tags
  - scoop grip; retention; structural gripping

### 1.18 Ankle Gripping (1:11:16–1:15:09)
- Key concepts
  - Ankle control is a common initial handle but must be upgraded quickly to prevent easy withdrawal.
  - The ankle is a distal control point; without complementary controls, the opponent can retract the leg.
- Position–structure
  - Ankle grip as initial connection → upgrade to stronger 2-on-1 leg control and/or inside positioning for entry.
- Key cues
  - Use ankle grips to *connect*, not to “win the position” by themselves.
  - Immediately build a second control (shin contact, knee line influence, or 2-on-1).
- Drills
  - Ankle-to-upgrade reps: start with ankle grip; partner tries to pull free; your job is to upgrade to 2-on-1 leg control before release.
- System tags
  - ankle grip; initial connection; control upgrade pathway
