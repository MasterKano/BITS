# VIEWING NOTES – Enter the System – Leg Locks

## 3.0 Volume 3

### 3.1 Introduction (0:00 - 1:43)
- Key concepts
  - “Distance + connection” as the next gate after inside position: knee captured inside your knee line, then you can progress.
  - Penetration skill is required to *get to* the knee line and establish a stable entanglement.
  - Ashi as a control system (not a submission): identify roles (push leg / pull leg) and test integrity with gravity.
- Position–structure
  - Early framing: the ashi configuration is a *connection* platform that enables heel exposure → resistance control → break.
- Key cues
  - If the knee isn’t truly inside your knee line, everything downstream becomes unreliable.
- Drills
  - “Knee-line check” reps: enter ashi and freeze; partner attempts to retract knee—confirm you can keep knee line.
- System tags
  - ashi-fundamentals, knee-line, connection

### 3.2 Single Leg Ashi (1:43 - 7:07)
- Key concepts
  - Irimi Ashi-Gurami framed as a “standard” entry connection: inside leg + outside leg with defined roles.
  - Avoid “pushing” into the torso/ribcage (can push opponent out of your ashi); use *backheeling* to pull and tighten.
  - Structural detail: close knee + ankle to create a “closed wedge/circle” around the leg (open wedge = opponent can exploit).
  - Connection integrity tests (no-hands): dragging and rolling tests while keeping knee line.
- Position–structure
  - Irimi as base configuration: outside leg primary hooking on/around hip line; inside leg supports knee-line control.
- Key cues
  - Backheel = heel to your buttocks; the pull action tightens and loads the structure.
  - “Closed wedge”: knee and ankle connection matters for keeping the knee captured.
- Drills
  - Dragging test (no hands): partner tries to scoot/drag away; retain knee inside knee line.
  - Rolling test (no hands): partner rolls; you retain knee inside knee line through the roll.
- System tags
  - irimi-ashi, connection-tests, backheel, wedge-closure

### 3.3 Double Leg Ashi (7:07 - 10:19)
- Key concepts
  - Transition from single-leg control to two-leg control when the second leg becomes available (especially during breakdowns).
  - Use positional changes (e.g., cross-buttock/X-guard style structures) to bring the secondary leg into range.
- Position–structure
  - Two-leg capture often appears as you force hands to the mat and/or elevate into X / reverse-X style controls.
- Key cues
  - Don’t “chase” the second leg with loose structure—force posture changes first (hands down, hips compromised), then collect.
- Drills
  - From irimi: partner postures/steps; you shift to a two-leg control configuration (goal: both legs controlled before reset).
- System tags
  - double-leg-control, x-guard-structures, secondary-leg-collection

### 3.4 Inside Leg Breakdowns (10:19 - 16:12)
- Key concepts
  - High percentage leg locks require breaking opponent down to hip (or at least knee); avoid trying to finish vs fully standing.
  - Single-leg X style breakdown commonly fails when opponent posture/head placement and stepping can “walk out” of pressure.
  - Foot placement modification: interference/tripping effect on the free leg is central to putting hips on the floor.
- Position–structure
  - Underneath opponent: ashi attachment + ability to force hands down / hips down = gateway to controlled finishing.
- Key cues
  - If opponent can keep walking and never “tips,” your structure is not interfering with their base effectively.
- Drills
  - “Stand-over breakdown” reps: start in underneath ashi; objective is *hip-down* before any submission mechanics.
- System tags
  - breakdown-to-hip, standing-opponent, base-interference

### 3.5 Cross Ashi (16:12 - 19:03)
- Key concepts
  - Cross-buttock positioning as a practical adjustment when the initial ashi is being stripped or walked out.
  - Cross-buttock can be used to force hands to the mat and re-throw/re-lock the ashi and/or transition into X-guard family.
- Position–structure
  - Cross-buttock as a “catch and reattach” structure: you sacrifice the initial bite to regain control with better leverage.
- Key cues
  - Use the cross-buttock position to *bring legs into range* rather than fighting a losing static ashi.
- Drills
  - “Strip response” drill: partner starts to peel/interfere; you immediately switch to cross-buttock → hands down → re-attach.
- System tags
  - cross-buttock, re-attachment, x-guard-bridge

### 3.6 Introduction (19:03 - 22:14)
- Key concepts
  - Center-line posture problem: when opponent’s head is on the center line and level is lowered, they can absorb pressure and step.
  - The breakdown problem is framed as denying the opponent the ability to freely hop/step and re-balance.
- Position–structure
  - Opponent posture + head line controls how easily they can “walk” through your pressure.
- Key cues
  - If the head stays center-line and they can keep stepping, you must change how you interfere with their base.
- Drills
  - “Center-line resistance” reps: partner intentionally keeps head center-line and backsteps; you practice base-interference options.
- System tags
  - posture-problems, center-line, breakdown-diagnostics

### 3.7 Lifting Method (22:14 - 28:27)
- Key concepts
  - Use elevation and directed lifting (not straight up) to break structure: lift into a curve (“power curve”) to bring the far leg in.
  - Once posture is compromised (hands down), transitions to reverse-X style structures can complete the breakdown.
- Position–structure
  - Reverse-X / scoop-grip style control appears as a stable platform once you have hands forced down.
- Key cues
  - Lift is not purely vertical: curved lifting changes how the far leg becomes collectable.
- Drills
  - From X/reverse-X: lift on “power curve” to force hip-down; reset once hips touch.
- System tags
  - elevation, power-curve, reverse-x, scoop-grip

### 3.8 Lifting Method Cross Ashi (28:27 - 30:59)
- Key concepts
  - Chain: cross-buttock → hands to mat → re-throw ashi → collect second leg → small force finishes the breakdown.
  - “Don’t wait” logic: instead of waiting for the opponent to interfere, you can go straight to the double-leg situation.
- Position–structure
  - Cross-buttock as the bridge into a two-leg lifting/breakdown structure.
- Key cues
  - Once hands touch the mat, your angle and leverage improve—capitalize immediately.
- Drills
  - Timed reps: achieve hands-down within 3–5 seconds, then complete breakdown via two-leg collection.
- System tags
  - cross-buttock-to-double-leg, hands-down, breakdown-chains

### 3.9 Centerline Method (30:59 - 33:24)
- Key concepts
  - Center-line head placement increases opponent’s ability to step/backstep; you must create stronger tripping/interference.
  - Tripping/interference detail is what changes “walking out” into “hip-down.”
- Position–structure
  - The opponent’s stepping mechanics are the target (deny the step rather than pushing harder).
- Key cues
  - If they can keep stepping, your pressure is being *accommodated* rather than converting into a fall.
- Drills
  - Partner goal: keep head center-line and step/backstep; attacker goal: deny step and put hips down.
- System tags
  - center-line-method, base-denial, tripping

### 3.10 Tilting Method (33:24 - 35:39)
- Key concepts
  - Tilting the opponent’s hands to the mat creates angle; angle improves your ability to reconfigure into stronger leg control.
  - Conventional X-guard configuration referenced as a staging point before switching to reverse-X.
- Position–structure
  - Angle creation (tilt) precedes leg-collection; angle makes your subsequent X/reverse-X transitions higher percentage.
- Key cues
  - Tilt first, then reconfigure your legs—don’t try to rebuild structure while the opponent is still upright and square.
- Drills
  - “Tilt-to-structure” reps: hands-down tilt → establish X-guard → switch to reverse-X → hip-down.
- System tags
  - tilt, angle-creation, x-guard, reverse-x

### 3.11 Negating Resistance Intro (35:39 - 44:16)
- Key concepts
  - Resistance is framed as three problems: rotation escape, distance (knee extraction), and breaking the ashi structure.
  - A preferred solution pathway is introduced: move from heel exposure to a stronger control that limits escape options.
- Position–structure
  - The control position must be chosen to address the opponent’s *escape mode*, not just your preferred finish.
- Key cues
  - Identify which escape the opponent is attempting (rotate / pull knee / peel structure) before selecting the control upgrade.
- Drills
  - “Three escapes” game: partner cycles rotation/distance/peel; attacker must name the escape and respond with control choice.
- System tags
  - resistance-management, rotation-distance-structure, decision-rules

### 3.12 General Theory Intro (44:16 - 45:45)
- Key concepts
  - System sequence is reinforced: entry/connection → heel exposure → escape negation → breaking position.
  - “Heel exposure gate”: without heel exposure, nothing progresses.
- Position–structure
  - Each step is a gate; skipping gates creates unreliable breaks.
- Key cues
  - Treat heel exposure as a separate skill from breaking—don’t blend them.
- Drills
  - Step ladder reps: start at each gate and progress one step only; reset if the gate is lost.
- System tags
  - 4-step-sequence, heel-exposure, gates

### 3.13 General Theory (45:45 - 54:05)
- Key concepts
  - Heel exposure method shown: replace foot from hip to floor, hand to knee, shimmy hips, bring foot across for exposure.
  - Backheel concept returns as a tightening mechanic once exposure is created.
  - Structural defense: triangle/senkaku-style leg locking increases difficulty for opponent to pry the legs apart and break structure.
- Position–structure
  - Inside-ashi used as the heel-exposure configuration; triangle structure used as a stabilizer against structural breaks.
- Key cues
  - Don’t “dig” down for the heel if it makes you vulnerable; use positional switching to create exposure.
  - Triangle/senkaku = structural integrity tool, not just a “finish” position.
- Drills
  - Heel exposure reps: irimi → foot-to-floor/hand-to-knee → hip shimmy → heel exposed → lock triangle.
- System tags
  - heel-exposure, inside-ashi, senkaku, backheel

### 3.14 Follow Through (54:05 - 59:04)
- Key concepts
  - “Arc of breaking”: if you remain static and opponent rotates past the arc, the break is lost.
  - Follow-through principle: knee follows their knee; point knee down to track and prevent distance/rotation escapes.
- Position–structure
  - Dynamic tracking replaces static finishing: you stay inside the breaking arc by matching rotation and limiting distance.
- Key cues
  - Your knee orientation (down to mat) is used as a control signal to follow and deny distance.
- Drills
  - “Arc tracking” rounds: partner rotates/runs; attacker must keep knee following knee and maintain the breaking arc.
- System tags
  - follow-through, arc-of-breaking, knee-tracking

### 3.15 Slack Removal (59:04 - 1:04:30)
- Key concepts
  - Implied slack principles: closed wedge (knee+ankle), backheeling pulls, and structural locking (triangle) reduce looseness.
  - Avoid pushes that create space or allow the opponent to peel structure; tighten via pull mechanics and alignment.
- Position–structure
  - “Tightening” is achieved through leg alignment and pulling mechanics more than squeezing harder.
- Key cues
  - Backheel is repeatedly emphasized as a tightening action rather than a pushing action.
- Drills
  - “Tighten then move” reps: establish wedge closure → backheel tightening → only then transition to the next step.
- System tags
  - slack-removal, wedge-closure, backheel, structure-integrity

### 3.16 Gripping (1:04:30 - 1:11:25)
- Key concepts
  - Upper-body tie-in example: collar-tie depth (wrist deep), and forehead-to-shoulder connection to prevent easy clearing/entry.
  - Grip/tie details are used to delay opponent’s access to your legs and support safer entries to your leg connection.
- Position–structure
  - Collar-and-elbow style ties can funnel into leg entry (irimi) while disrupting opponent’s posture and hand access.
- Key cues
  - Shallow collar ties (fingers) are unreliable; depth and head connection matter.
- Drills
  - Tie-to-entry: establish collar-tie depth + forehead connection → partner tries to clear and enter legs → you enter irimi.
- System tags
  - collar-tie, head-connection, tie-to-entry

### 3.17 Outside Heel Hook (1:11:25 - 1:18:42)
- Key concepts
  - Distinguish direction of ashi force vs direction of breaking force: effective heel hooks require *opposing* forces.
  - Outside ashi highlighted as a preferred breaking configuration because it creates a “tearing paper” opposing-force effect.
  - Finishing detail emphasized: pull with legs (never push), top knee comes over to complete the breaking position.
- Position–structure
  - Sequence recap: irimi entry → inside-ashi for heel exposure → far-hip control to negate escapes → outside-ashi breaking.
- Key cues
  - Opposing forces principle is the key diagnostic for why “old heel hooks” failed.
  - Pulling mechanics with legs are prioritized.
- Drills
  - Full sequence reps (no finish pressure): entry/connection → heel exposure → far-hip control → outside-ashi breaking position.
- System tags
  - outside-ashi, heel-hook, opposing-forces, sequence-integration

### 3.18 Inside Heel Hook (1:18:42 - 1:25:49)
- Key concepts
  - BIO-level note: the overall system is built around inside and outside heel hooks as primary finishes (details vary by position).
  - In this volume’s transcript segment, heel hook work emphasizes positional sequencing and opposing-force mechanics more than a separate inside-heel-hook module.
- Position–structure
  - Treat inside heel hook as part of the same gate sequence; position choice determines exposure, resistance profile, and break mechanics.
- Key cues
  - Keep the “gates” model: don’t attempt inside-heel finishing mechanics without exposure + resistance control.
- Drills
  - Gate drill specific to inside heel hook: start from heel exposure and focus on maintaining control through the opponent’s first escape attempt.
- System tags
  - inside-heel-hook, gates, exposure-to-control
