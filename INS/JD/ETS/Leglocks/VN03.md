# VIEWING NOTES — ETS Leg Locks

## 2.0 Volume 2

### 2.1 Attaining Inside (0:00–5:00)
- Key concepts
  - Inside position is treated as the critical gateway to reliable leg attacks (especially ashi-garami based attacks).
  - “Inside” vs “outside” control is framed as a core distinction across common guards and standing engagements.
  - Inside position is not binary; there are grades/qualities of inside position.
- Position–structure
  - Guard taxonomy contrast: classic outside-position guards vs inside-position entanglements that put your legs between/inside the opponent’s legs/centerline.
- Key cues
  - If your legs are outside their legs, you are structurally limited in your ability to enter ashi cleanly.
  - Improve inside position *before* you chase finishing mechanics.
- Drills
  - Inside-position check reps: start seated vs partner standing; goal is to establish (or deny) inside position for 5–10 seconds, then reset.
- System tags
  - inside position; leg-control hierarchy; entry prerequisites

### 2.2 Standing Opponent (5:00–7:49)
- Key concepts
  - Against a standing opponent, you must systematically bring your feet/legs to the inside to create the possibility of ashi entries.
  - If your legs remain outside, you cannot effectively “go into the legs” for ashi.
- Position–structure
  - Seated engagement vs standing: inside-foot positioning is treated as the “first gate” to meaningful leg engagement.
- Key cues
  - Don’t accept outside legs vs a standing opponent; treat that as a losing alignment for this system.
- Drills
  - Inside-foot pummeling: partner stands square; bottom player pummels feet to inside position without committing to an entry; reset on loss of inside.
- System tags
  - seated vs standing; inside-foot pummeling; alignment

### 2.3 De La Riva (7:49–12:17)
- Key concepts
  - De La Riva is presented as an outside-position engagement that must be upgraded toward inside position for the leg lock system.
  - Inside position quality matters (having “some” inside does not automatically equal a usable inside control).
- Position–structure
  - Outside control (DLR-style hook) → progressive movement/pummeling to bring the leg line toward inside control.
- Key cues
  - Recognize when your inside position is superficial and does not transmit control/tension into the opponent.
- Drills
  - DLR-to-inside upgrade flow: start in an outside-position hook scenario; objective is to pummel/adjust to a clearer inside position, then reset (no finish).
- System tags
  - DLR transition; inside upgrade; pummeling pathways

### 2.4 Pummelling Legs Top Position (12:17–18:40)
- Key concepts
  - Inside position can be pursued from top as well: leg pummeling is a primary mechanism to win interior alignment.
  - Distance management and posting are used to prevent the opponent from closing distance or collapsing your mobility while you pummel.
- Position–structure
  - Top stance engagement → maintain workable distance/post → pummel legs to win inside alignment.
- Key cues
  - Keep enough distance that the opponent cannot simply clamp/close you down while you’re trying to pummel inside.
- Drills
  - Top pummel rounds: from a controlled standing distance, top player’s only goal is to pummel to an inside alignment; bottom player’s goal is to square/deny.
- System tags
  - top pummeling; distance/post; inside alignment

### 2.5 Movement Inside (18:40–25:07)
- Key concepts
  - Movement/footwork is used to access inside position (not just “reaching” for legs).
  - The toe line and angle are used as practical references for where you must step to gain interior access.
- Position–structure
  - Step/angle to access the toe line → shift to interior line → create conditions for leg engagement.
- Key cues
  - Don’t chase inside position with arms-only; step to the correct line and let structure do the work.
- Drills
  - Toe-line stepping reps: partner gives light resistance; you step to toe line and re-square to an inside track repeatedly (no entry).
- System tags
  - toe line; entry footwork; angle creation

### 2.6 Supine Opponent (25:07–32:09)
- Key concepts
  - Inside positioning principles apply vs a supine opponent: you want your legs to win the interior track.
  - A coach’s “room scan” heuristic is implied: inside/outside alignment can be visually diagnosed and predicts who is winning the engagement.
- Position–structure
  - Supine guard engagement → inside track with your legs/knees → deny opponent’s inside control.
- Key cues
  - If the opponent’s legs/knees win inside control, your ability to progress to ashi is compromised.
- Drills
  - Supine inside-track game: start in open guard range; each partner tries to win inside leg position for 5 seconds; reset on clear win.
- System tags
  - supine engagement; inside track; diagnostic alignment

### 2.7 Hand Post - Leg Pummeling (32:09–39:53)
- Key concepts
  - Clear demarcations are emphasized: toe line vs knee line (used as simple reference points to guide entry decisions).
  - Hand posting assists leg pummeling by stabilizing and managing distance/angle while your legs work for inside position.
- Position–structure
  - Use posts to support hip movement → pummel legs for inside position → orient toward knee-line control.
- Key cues
  - Know which “line” you’re interacting with (toe line vs knee line) and adjust your movement accordingly.
- Drills
  - Post-and-pummel reps: one hand posts to stabilize while you pummel legs to improve inside position; switch sides each rep.
- System tags
  - posting; toe line vs knee line; pummeling mechanics

### 2.8 Irimi Ashi (39:53–48:48)
- Key concepts
  - Standard ashi (irimi ashi) is framed as the central entanglement for the system and is trained as a structured entry.
  - The “ankle line” is introduced as a decisive barrier: your hips must breach the ankle line to enter ashi effectively.
  - Connection and distance are tested without hands (hands-behind-back style constraints appear repeatedly as a diagnostic).
- Position–structure
  - Standing partner (square stance) → breach ankle line with hips → build standard ashi structure (hands constrained to emphasize leg mechanics).
- Key cues
  - If your hips cannot get past the ankle line, you cannot satisfactorily enter ashi.
  - Use the ankle line as a visual/structural trigger for “entry is possible vs entry is failing.”
- Drills
  - Ankle-line breach reps: partner stands wide/square; you attempt to breach the ankle line with hips and establish the basic ashi shape; reset on failure.
- System tags
  - irimi ashi; ankle line; hip breach; entry diagnostics

### 2.9 Knee and Knee Line (48:48–53:54)
- Key concepts
  - The knee line is treated as a major control threshold (especially for stabilizing entanglements and preventing escapes).
  - “Keep the opponent’s knee inside your knee line” is presented as a central control goal.
- Position–structure
  - Ashi control framed around where the opponent’s knee sits relative to your knee line (inside vs outside).
- Key cues
  - If the opponent’s knee is not inside your knee line, control and progression degrade rapidly.
- Drills
  - Knee-line hold: from a basic entanglement, partner tries to withdraw/turn; your sole goal is to keep their knee inside your knee line for 10 seconds.
- System tags
  - knee line; control threshold; retention

### 2.10 Connection Drills (53:54–58:05)
- Key concepts
  - Connection is elevated as a testable skill: gravity will reveal deficiencies in connection and distance.
  - The drill structure emphasizes posture (rounded spine), angle (often 45 degrees), and building wedge structures around the opponent’s leg.
- Position–structure
  - Hands constrained (or minimized) → legs provide the suspension/connection → posture and push–pull leg mechanics negate gravity.
- Key cues
  - If your connection is correct, you can be held off the floor by leg structure; if not, gravity exposes it immediately.
  - Build connection with posture first, then add the leg split/scissor mechanics.
- Drills
  - Connection suspension drill: partner stands; you build connection such that your legs can hold you off the floor (minimal hand use); reset on collapse.
- System tags
  - connection skill; gravity testing; posture; push/pull legs

### 2.11 Penetration Drills (58:05–1:04:13)
- Key concepts
  - Penetration is trained through angled entries and inversion-based mechanics (45-degree orientation appears as a recurring requirement).
  - A rolling inversion (Imanari-style) is used as a repeatable method to get underneath and into the legs.
  - The push-leg / pull-leg concept is explicitly tied to creating wedges (front/back) and negating gravity.
- Position–structure
  - 45-degree entry → wrist-deep leg entry → establish 2-on-1 → invert/roll → shoelace hook behind hamstring → create push/pull leg split.
- Key cues
  - Don’t enter square: set the 45-degree angle first.
  - Know which leg is pushing and which is pulling; the opposing directions create the wedge structure that holds you in place.
- Drills
  - 45-degree wrist-deep to inversion: partner stands; establish 45 degrees → wrist-deep entry → 2-on-1 → invert → shoelace hook; reset.
- System tags
  - penetration; 45-degree entry; inversion; push/pull legs; wedge creation

### 2.12 Gravity Drills (1:04:13–1:09:08)
- Key concepts
  - Gravity drills are presented as a simple, repeatable test suite (described as a set of four drills) that exposes failures in distance/connection.
  - First gravity drill is framed as foundational: get underneath the opponent and enter standard ashi.
  - Ankle line remains the key boundary condition for success.
- Position–structure
  - Standing partner (wide, square stance) + hands constrained → breach ankle line → standard ashi entry.
- Key cues
  - “Gravity reveals” errors: if you’re collapsing, fix connection/distance rather than forcing the next step.
- Drills
  - Gravity drill #1 (basic): hands constrained; breach ankle line and enter standard ashi; reset immediately when gravity collapses posture/connection.
- System tags
  - gravity drills; testing framework; standard ashi; ankle line

### 2.13 Gravity Drills 2 (1:09:08–1:14:20)
- Key concepts
  - Second gravity drill continues the progression: reinforce distance + connection so you can reliably get underneath and enter the legs.
  - The drill series is framed as bridging a beginner into usable entries by forcing correct posture and distance habits.
- Position–structure
  - Build wedges front/back of the opponent’s leg and maintain knee-line control while suspending yourself against gravity.
- Key cues
  - Treat distance + connection as the two gates; if either is off, gravity punishes you.
- Drills
  - Gravity drill #2: start from posture; build a stable leg connection (minimal hands) and progress underneath into leg engagement; reset on loss of suspension.
- System tags
  - gravity drill progression; distance + connection; wedge reinforcement

### 2.14 Gravity Drills 3 Rolling (1:14:20–1:17:43)
- Key concepts
  - Third gravity drill is explicitly a rolling inversion: essentially an Imanari-style roll done from the floor.
  - Entry is structured: 45 degrees → wrist-deep entry → 2-on-1 → invert → shoelace hook behind hamstring.
  - Push-leg / pull-leg split is the stabilizing mechanism that holds you off the floor and creates bilateral wedges.
- Position–structure
  - 45-degree alignment → wrist-deep entry → 2-on-1 → inversion → shoelace hook → push/pull leg split → wedge front/back.
- Key cues
  - Keep the angle (don’t go square).
  - Identify push leg vs pull leg; the opposing directions create control (not a simple “squeeze”).
- Drills
  - Gravity drill #3 (rolling): repeat the full sequence (45° → wrist deep → 2-on-1 → invert → hook) with hands minimized after connection is established.
- System tags
  - rolling inversion; imanari; 2-on-1; push/pull legs; bilateral wedges

### 2.15 Recovering Knee Line (1:17:43–1:22:41)
- Key concepts
  - Knee-line control is reaffirmed as a decisive checkpoint: keep the opponent’s knee inside your knee line using push/pull leg mechanics.
  - When the knee line is threatened, the solution is framed through re-establishing wedge structure (front/back) and reasserting push/pull alignment.
- Position–structure
  - Ashi structure stabilized by wedges + push/pull legs → keeps opponent’s knee positioned inside your knee line.
- Key cues
  - If the opponent’s knee begins to escape the knee line, immediately reassert push/pull leg structure and re-point the bottom knee toward the top knee.
- Drills
  - Knee-line recovery reps: start with a “slipping knee line” scenario; re-build push/pull leg alignment to bring the opponent’s knee back inside your knee line; reset.
- System tags
  - knee-line recovery; retention; push/pull correction; wedge rebuild
