# VIEWING NOTES — ETS Leg Locks

## 4.0 Volume 4

### 4.1 Intro (0:00–2:26)
- Key concepts
  - System recap: inside position is the first gate; without it the system stops.
  - After inside position: establish knee line + solid connection to hips/legs.
  - Heel exposure is a distinct phase: if you cannot physically expose the heel, nothing else matters (strength/tightness is irrelevant).
  - Once heel exposure occurs, expect extreme resistance (“panic buttons”): three main escape attempts are described:
    - break the integrity of ashi
    - rotate rapidly
    - push knee free of the knee line (or combinations)
  - Four-step shutdown model: connection → heel exposure → negate escape attempts → breaking position.
- Position–structure
  - Straight-ashi subsystem: inside position → connection/knee line → heel exposure → escape negation → breaking.
- Key cues
  - Treat heel exposure as a non-negotiable gate; do not skip ahead to “finish mechanics.”
  - Identify which of the three escape categories is happening before you respond.
- Drills
  - “Four-step ladder” reps: start at each phase and progress one step only; reset when the gate is lost.
- System tags
  - gates; knee line; heel exposure; resistance categories; 4-step sequence

### 4.2 Shared Spiral Problem (2:26–7:12)
- Key concepts
  - Heel hooks are spiral/twisting locks; many failed historically because breaking forces were applied in the same direction as the opponent’s escape rotation.
  - Outside ashi finish is emphasized as the preferred breaking approach in straight-ashi because:
    - ashi direction and heel-hook breaking direction oppose (tear-the-paper model).
- Position–structure
  - Straight ashi sequence is framed as: irimi ashi → inside ashi for heel exposure → outside ashi for break (with minor variations on the ashi details).
- Key cues
  - If your breaking effort helps their rotation, you are feeding the escape; you need opposing forces.
- Drills
  - “Tear the paper” mechanics drill: partner rotates in their preferred direction; you must align ashi + heel-hook so your force opposes the rotation before any finish pressure.
- System tags
  - shared spiral; opposing forces; outside ashi finish; straight-ashi sequencing

### 4.3 Single Ashi Solution (7:12–11:43)
- Key concepts
  - Clear line rule for the finishing grip: keep wrist operating below the opponent’s ankle; once the wrist rises above the ankle line, efficiency drops.
  - Opposing forces appear at two levels:
    - between heel hook and ashi-garami direction
    - within the foot: simultaneous pull on the heel + push on the toes (“two ends of the lever”).
- Position–structure
  - Outside ashi breaking position framed as a single-position finish that solves “same-direction” failure patterns.
- Key cues
  - Wrist below ankle line.
  - Build push-on-toes + pull-on-heel before you expect reliable breaking power.
- Drills
  - “Below-ankle” grip reps: partner gives moderate movement; you repeatedly set toe line into the bicep and lock hands with wrist below the ankle; reset on wrist creep.
- System tags
  - grip demarcation; ankle line; toe line; push/pull lever; outside ashi mechanics

### 4.4 Multiple Ashi Solution (11:43–16:14)
- Key concepts
  - Power generation is linked to whole-body alignment: head and hands must move together; if the head moves away from the hands, power bleeds.
  - Movement path: head/hands move in a curve away and up (not a straight, disconnected action).
  - Multiple ashi variants can all break well; choice can be personal—priority is correct mechanics and grip integrity.
- Position–structure
  - Demonstration emphasis on how upper-body mechanics (head/hands path) integrate with ashi to produce maximal breaking pressure.
- Key cues
  - Head and hands are “one unit” during the finish.
  - Move in a curved path away/up from the mat (not head-away while hands stay).
- Drills
  - “Head-hands unity” reps: lock a basic finish position and rehearse the curved head/hands path with no finish pressure; partner gives light rotational resistance.
- System tags
  - finishing mechanics; head-hands linkage; ashi variants; power curve

### 4.5 Exposing The Heel (16:14–19:37)
- Key concepts
  - Heel exposure is treated as its own phase; inside-ashi configurations are presented as the best exposure method.
  - Emphasis that exposure changes the opponent’s behavior: once exposed, resistance intensity spikes.
- Position–structure
  - Inside ashi as the exposure platform; exposure precedes the switch into the chosen breaking position.
- Key cues
  - Separate “expose” from “break.” If exposure fails, do not force breaking mechanics.
- Drills
  - “Exposure-only” rounds: start from inside ashi; goal is heel exposure and a freeze (no finish); partner’s goal is to hide heel and begin one escape attempt.
- System tags
  - heel exposure; inside ashi; phase separation; panic response

### 4.6 Negating Resistance (19:37–26:52)
- Key concepts
  - Resistance taxonomy is repeated and operationalized: opponent will try to (1) break ashi structure, (2) rotate, (3) free the knee line.
  - A “closed system of wedges” concept appears: wedge control around the hips limits opponent’s options, including their ability to attack your heels.
  - Knee-down emphasis: pointing the knee down helps prevent knee-line loss even without hands.
- Position–structure
  - Escape negation framed as stabilizing wedges + protecting the knee line prior to finishing.
- Key cues
  - Identify the escape category, then choose the control response (do not treat all resistance the same).
  - When knee line is threatened, reassert knee-down and wedge closure before attacking.
- Drills
  - “Three escapes” game: partner cycles (structure break / rotate / knee-line escape); you must hold position for 10 seconds by responding correctly, then reset.
- System tags
  - escape taxonomy; wedge closure; knee-down control; resistance management

### 4.7 Breaking (26:52–36:43)
- Key concepts
  - Outside ashi breaking emphasized with specific assembly steps:
    - toe line into the bicep
    - wrist below the ankle
    - lock hands (example shown: palm-to-palm)
    - apply inward pull with feet + elbow connection to ribs to preload tension before finishing motion
  - Breaking is framed as a progression: first “put tension in the leg,” then apply the finishing action.
- Position–structure
  - Outside ashi breaking position: structured pre-tension + integrated body mechanics.
- Key cues
  - Preload tension before the finishing action; do not “jump” to the end.
  - Wrist below ankle line remains a key integrity check.
- Drills
  - “Preload then finish” reps: build the finish structure and hold for 3 seconds (tension only), then perform the finish motion under strict control.
- System tags
  - outside ashi; finish assembly; tensioning; wrist-below-ankle; toe line control

### 4.8 Cycles of Inside Outside Dominance (36:43–43:04)
- Key concepts
  - Inside leg vs outside leg have different jobs; dominance can be cycled depending on goal:
    - outside leg dominance used to expose heel
    - inside leg dominance used to follow turns and control knee line
  - Core historical error: pushing opponent in the same direction as their escape and then applying heel force in the same direction (no opposing forces).
  - Cycling dominance is presented as a requirement for consistent results: switch which leg is dominant as the opponent turns.
- Position–structure
  - Ashi is a two-leg system; the system requires you to change which leg is doing the primary work as the exchange evolves.
- Key cues
  - Use outside-leg dominance for exposure; shift dominance as the opponent turns so you remain aligned with the breaking arc.
- Drills
  - “Dominance cycling” rounds: partner turns in both directions; you must cycle inside/outside leg dominance to keep heel exposure and knee-line integrity.
- System tags
  - inside/outside dominance; cycling; exposure mechanics; breaking alignment

### 4.9 Stopping The Spiral (43:04–48:46)
- Key concepts
  - Shared-spiral concept is made explicit: attacker’s heel-hook spiral and defender’s escape spiral can match, producing stalemates and resets.
  - The central task becomes stopping or curtailing the spiralling process rather than “cranking harder.”
- Position–structure
  - Spiral control is framed as positional/structural control: prevent the opponent from freely matching your rotation.
- Key cues
  - If both of you are spiralling the same way with no result, you must change how you control the spiral (not add force).
- Drills
  - “Spiral-stalemate” reps: start in a locked heel-hook position; partner’s goal is to spin out; your goal is to stop/curtail the spin without unlocking structure; reset after 5–10 seconds.
- System tags
  - spiral management; shared spiral; anti-spin controls

### 4.10 CONTROL SPEED OF THE SPIRAL (48:46–1:11:46)
- Key concepts
  - Rolling mechanics directly affect spiral control:
    - do not roll over an elbow (it creates friction/awkwardness and slows you)
    - roll over shoulders to match opponent’s rotational speed
  - If you slow down while the opponent maintains speed, they gain rotational advantage and escape.
  - Maintain the lock/connection while moving; unlocking hands during the roll creates failure windows.
- Position–structure
  - Spiral control depends on matching and managing rotation through body mechanics (shoulder roll) while maintaining structural connection.
- Key cues
  - Shoulder roll, not elbow prop.
  - Match speed; maintain connection during the roll.
- Drills
  - “Shoulder-roll chase” drill: partner rolls as fast as possible; you maintain lock and roll over shoulders to stay aligned; reset if you prop on elbow or lose connection.
- System tags
  - spiral speed control; shoulder roll; connection under rotation; anti-escape mechanics
