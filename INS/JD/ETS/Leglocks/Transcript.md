#Series:** Enter the System - Leg Locks
**Instructor:** John Danaher  
**Volumes:** 1–8  
**Context:** This is the groundbreaking instructional that reshaped modern no-gi jiu-jitsu by presenting lower body submissions as a complete, systematic approach rather than isolated moves. Danaher begins by explaining the centrality of ashi garami positions (single-leg X, outside ashi, cross ashi, 50/50, and saddle/inside sankaku) as control systems that immobilize the opponent’s hips and legs. He details how to enter leg entanglements safely from standing, guard, and passing scenarios, emphasizing kuzushi (off-balancing) and structured entries over opportunism. The core of the system revolves around the heel hook as the decisive submission, with mechanics, finishing details, and safety considerations thoroughly broken down. Danaher also maps out secondary submissions (straight ankle locks, toe holds, kneebars) as complementary weapons when the heel hook is unavailable. A major focus is positional control and retention, showing how to maintain dominance within leg entanglements, cycle between positions, and counter common escapes. Finally, he integrates the leg lock game with upper-body attacks and traditional jiu-jitsu, ensuring it is not a “separate art” but part of a unified grappling strategy. The result is a complete leg lock framework that balances positional safety, high-percentage finishing, and strategic integration with the rest of jiu-jitsu.


## Volume 1

(0:04 - 0:22)
Hi, my name is John Danaher. I'm going to teach elements of my leg lock system, which I taught to a group of talented students that I had in New York City, and which they used with spectacular success in international level grappling. I'm joined by a very good friend of mine, Bernardo Faria.

(0:22 - 0:25)
Hello, John. Thank you. And my assistant, Karl Massara.

(0:30 - 0:55)
My intention in these videos is not simply to offer a collection of techniques. The world is full of instructional videos where a talented teacher or athlete shows a collection of moves. My intention, rather, is to show a holistic approach to leg locking that takes an athlete from the very beginning of an engagement, from the time of slapping hands with an opponent, all the way through, hopefully, to a successful submission hold.

(0:56 - 1:25)
You're going to learn that there's a sequence of steps which encapsulate both techniques and tactics, which go in predictable fashion, leading from a neutral start to a decisive conclusion. Much of what I teach is going to be put in the backdrop of four mechanical elements, which form the basis of my entire teaching methodology. The first of these is well known to many people, the idea of lever and fulcrum.

(1:25 - 1:52)
But I want to go further into the notion of lever and fulcrum and get more precise about exactly what we mean when we use these terms in the context that we get to. Let's start off with a way of thinking about lever and fulcrum. Most people are aware that in the use of lever and fulcrum, I want to manipulate the end of the lever.

(1:53 - 2:09)
I want to maximise my leverage by positioning or applying my forces at the end of a lever. Much less is talked about with regards to the fulcrum. A fulcrum, its value, can be judged according to three distinct elements.

(2:09 - 2:22)
First, the height of the fulcrum, the hardness of the fulcrum. These are critical concepts. Let's have a look in the case of Judy Gattame, and then we'll bring it back to Leglocks later on.

(2:23 - 2:35)
The armbar, Judy Gattame, is well known to even beginning students at Jiu-Jitsu. It involves, obviously, a lever. When I go to work, I always want to work at the end of the lever.

(2:35 - 3:01)
So often I see people working down here, the short end of the lever, when in fact they should be working up high at the end of the lever. The fulcrum, most people use the middle of their thighs as the breaking fulcrum. So they'll take the hand back in the direction where the lever arm is taken through the middle of the thighs, and they're taught to pinch their knees as a means of creating a fulcrum over which to break the arm.

(3:02 - 3:12)
There's some problems associated with this, you can see at the start. No matter how strong I flex my legs, the muscles are not particularly hard. There's a problem with the hardness of the fulcrum.

(3:13 - 3:25)
Picture a situation where I'm trying to break a pencil. If I put a pencil over a very hard fulcrum, it's extremely easy to break it. But if I put that same pencil over a very soft fulcrum, now it's difficult.

(3:25 - 3:48)
So I want to maximise the hardness of the fulcrum. A simple way for me to do this is instead of using my inner thigh muscles, I'll use the hard bones of the hip. So when I go to take someone's arm, I want to make sure I take his right arm over my right hip, so that I use the hard bones of the hip as a breaking fulcrum, rather than the soft inner thigh muscles.

(3:48 - 4:01)
So this is the practical sense in which we use the hardness principle of fulcrums. We always want to maximise the hardness of the fulcrum. We'll soon see that the same thing can be done in the case of leg locking.

(4:01 - 4:12)
The other element is the height of the fulcrum. The lower the fulcrum, the harder it is for me to break a pencil over, for example. So I want to do everything I can to raise the height of a given fulcrum.

(4:13 - 4:29)
In the case of judogitami, this is done by ensuring that my feet come back towards my opponent in a back-heel fashion. I can also take one leg and raise the knee, so that my hip is raised relative to the floor. And as a result, we get very, very strong breaking effects.

(4:30 - 4:45)
I can also do it by changing the very nature of the judogitami. I can, for example, put a foot underneath my opponent's head, and this will artificially raise the height of the fulcrum on the right-hand side. And as a result, we get much stronger breaking effects in a shorter distance.

(4:45 - 4:59)
Why? Because I've raised the height of the fulcrum. I'm maximising the hardness of the fulcrum by taking over the hip bone rather than the soft adductor muscles, and I'm raising the height. As a result, I get better breaking leverage.

(5:03 - 5:23)
Considerations like these are extremely important when it comes time to apply the principles of lever and fulcrum in any jiu-jitsu context. So that's our first major thing that we're going to be pushing as we go through this entire DVD series, the idea of lever and fulcrum. Paying particular attention to the idea of maximising the use of the fulcrum through height and hardness.

(5:24 - 5:42)
The other element, of course, in fulcrums is placement. If I place the fulcrum in an inefficient spot, I have to do more mechanical, apply greater force to get the break. So we're going to be paying a lot of attention to the placement of the fulcrum, the hardness of the fulcrum, and the height of the fulcrum.

(5:42 - 6:13)
These will be critical concepts as we work our way through the DVD. A second key element in terms of this pure mechanics, which will play a very, very important role throughout this DVD, is the idea of directionality of force. So often I see talented students doubling or tripling the amount of work they have to do to get a task done by applying forces in the wrong directions, or in less than optimal directions.

(6:14 - 6:29)
Let's look at a common sense example that you're all familiar with, a basic butterfly sweep. For any basic sweeping situation, I want to apply forces in a given direction. Some of those directions will be more efficient than others.

(6:30 - 6:53)
If I try to sweep Carlos Carlos directly to the side, I'm sweeping into one of his bases of support, especially when he starts to extend the leg up. As a result, I'm having to do tremendous work because I'm pushing into my opponent's base of support. But just a simple change in direction to a forward angle means that I get much better results.

(6:53 - 7:22)
It's not that I got majorly stronger, it's just that I employed the same amount of force in a more efficient direction. Maximising our use of force through applying forces in the appropriate direction is going to be an extremely important theme throughout this entire DVD series. A third critical theme is the idea of Kizushi, or off-balancing.

(7:22 - 7:43)
In theoretical terms, Kizushi is really just an extension of labour and fulcrum, but it's such an important subset of that study in bottom position that I actually separated it into distinct entities. I didn't do this study in and of itself. So for example, I had someone standing over me in butterfly guard.

(7:44 - 8:05)
As long as he's in good stance, working against me, it's difficult for me to do anything effective on someone who's in good stance and in good balance. But the moment I start to offset my opponent's balance, I get the two things that I need in order to play a strong submissions game. These are the idea of extension and movement.

(8:05 - 8:25)
If you give me an opponent who's moving and extended, I can submit him. But if my opponent's contracted, it's hard for me to go into my submissions game. But the moment I start getting people out of balance and disturbing their base of support by taking their centre of gravity outside of their base of support, getting hands to the floor, et cetera, et cetera, and suddenly where I get extension, now I can go into submissions.

(8:26 - 8:45)
I've broken his stance, I've disconnected my opponent, and now the submissions game starts to become easy. From here, it won't be a difficult thing for me to fly my legs up into winning positions. So this will form another key element, a key theme that will run throughout this DVD, the idea of Kizushi.

(8:45 - 9:28)
Whenever we're in bottom position, regardless of bottom position we're in, anytime we find ourselves underneath our opponent, we're always looking to get their centre of gravity over their base of support, disturb their balance, and create extension and motion. If I have those two things, I can enter into my opponent's legs repeatedly and get to a winning. Now a fourth key theme that we work with, and one which I don't think has really been emphasised at all in Jiu-Jitsu instruction, but which I believe is absolutely one of the most important mechanical features of Jiu-Jitsu, is the use of wedges.

(9:30 - 9:49)
Wedges are really just a species of inclined plane in physics. They can be used for many different tasks, but in the context of Jiu-Jitsu, the number one task they're employed for is to immobilise people. Often, when we think in Jiu-Jitsu, we talk about immobilisation in terms of body weight.

(9:50 - 10:07)
In fact, wedges are by far and away the most important form of immobilisation. If I can immobilise an opponent, then I can work my own body around them and ultimately control them and cement them. If I can't immobilise someone, if I can't directly control their movement, I'm not going to cement anybody.

(10:08 - 10:20)
The use of wedges is easily demonstrated by a simple experiment. Bernardo, you're going to the power platform, start control body. Let's do an experiment here.

(10:20 - 10:30)
Bernardo Ferrer is on top of his opponent. Bernardo is going to take his hands and put them behind his back. Both hands? Your hands behind your own back.

(10:30 - 10:40)
Now you're going to take your knees off the floor. Good. Right now, Bernardo Ferrer has a significant amount of his body weight directly on the chest at Kama-Sara.

(10:40 - 10:56)
There's a sense in which this is a good pin. He's chest to chest and a large percentage of his body weight is directly working down upon his opponent. And yet, if he maintained his hands behind his back and I asked Kama-Sara to slide out and put him in guard, it's Kota-Kama.

(10:58 - 11:06)
It was the easiest thing in the world. Why? Because Bernardo had no wedges around his opponent. Now let's contrast that.

(11:06 - 11:25)
This time, I'm just going to put a wedge underneath one side of my opponent's body and a wedge with my knee on the other side. You can clearly see, because my hand is on the floor, I have no body weight on top of Kama-Sara. There is no body weight there.

(11:25 - 11:40)
But when Karl goes to put me back in guard, he physically can't do it. It wasn't the body weight that held him down, it was the use of wedges. In fact, this time he applies the conventional pin.

(11:45 - 12:01)
Now, Bernardo has wedges on his opponent. When he applies his body weight now, when Karl goes to escape and put him back in guard, it's significantly more difficult for him. Why? What changed? Well, earlier he had no wedges around Kama-Sara's body.

(12:01 - 12:14)
Now he does. And in addition, he's reinforced him with body weight. The use of wedges to immobilise an opponent is probably the single most important thing that we're going to be pushing in this DVD series.

(12:15 - 12:31)
Now, how we use wedges is extremely important. Ashi-Gurami, the basis of this entire Lego DVD, is essentially a system of wedges around your opponent's legs and hips. But unlike a conventional pin, it's not reinforced by body weight.

(12:32 - 12:52)
When I go into an Ashi-Gurami position, I have no body weight on top of my opponent. The only thing holding him in is the wedges. Given a certain kind of Ashi-Gurami, because I have one form of Ashi-Gurami, the wedges that form around my opponent are not reinforced by body weight.

(12:54 - 13:17)
The only way I can reinforce them is mechanically by locking legs in various positions, etc. Now, as much as we like wedges, we like even more the notion of reinforced wedges. The question is, how are we going to reinforce them? Conventionally, in a pin, it's done by body weight, as we saw with an Aritabara earlier.

(13:18 - 13:27)
In the case of Ashi-Gurami, that's not the case. Since both of us have our bodies on the floor, neither one of us has weight on the other. So the system of reinforcement has to be very different.

(13:28 - 13:47)
Typically, it's done by locking legs. You know, triangles, or sankakus, or just simply crossing our feet. This idea of reinforced wedges and using wedges to immobilise opponents so that we can control them prior to submitting them is going to be one of the absolute most important themes that runs throughout this DVD series.

(13:52 - 14:10)
So right from the back, we're going to see that there are four keynote themes that run throughout this entire DVD series, which we will come back to time and again. These are the idea of Kizushi, or off-balancing. This is extremely important anytime you're in the bottom position.

(14:11 - 14:26)
Kizushi, or off-balancing, will create movement and extension and weaken my opponent's stance. It will create opportunities to go into locks on strong defensive opponents, opening up opportunities to go in and get to a leg lock finish. We've seen the idea of lever and foreground.

(14:26 - 14:52)
We've seen that we're going to insist on the idea of maximising the use of the lever by consistently hunting for the end of the lever and the manipulation of the end of the lever. At the same time, we're going to maximise our use of the foreground by insisting upon the height, the hardness, and the position of the foreground to make sure we get the greatest amount of mechanical work done with the least amount of effort. We've looked at the idea of directionality and force.

(14:52 - 15:11)
Every time we go to apply force in a leg lock situation, we're going to have to insist on the idea of the correct directions of force. Without that, we're always going to have substandard results with our leg lock in the end. And then arguably the most important of the four, the idea of wedging.

(15:12 - 15:32)
We're going to look at the idea of wedges as a means of immobilising an opponent, gaining control of their movement so that we can hold them long enough to go into a leg lock win. We've seen the idea of reinforcing wedges is extremely important. The best forms of wedge always involve wedges on both sides of the human body.

(15:32 - 15:54)
If I'm holding Carlos Araudel on the side of his face, and I have wedges on one side of his body, that will prove inadequate when he simply slides away from me and he's gone. I have wedges, but I only have them on one side of his body. When I apply a wedge on both sides of the body, now when he goes to move, I can easily immobilise him.

(15:54 - 16:09)
Okay, so we need wedges on both sides of the body. At the same time, we want to reinforce those wedges to the greatest degree possible. In the case of conventional fins, they're usually reinforced by body weight, but we can't do that in astrodynamics since they're both sitting in front of each other.

(16:09 - 16:28)
The wedges have to be reinforced by biomechanical means, usually cross feet or triangle legs. These four themes will run throughout our BDD series. Our intention is to show the leg lock system in its entirety.

(16:29 - 16:53)
The only way we can start that project is by giving a brief overview of what the leg lock system is. Most people teach a leg lock, they teach it as a simple move, a heel hook, a figure four toehold or what have you. What I want to do is to teach you an entire set of skills, what I call the six essential skills of heel hooking from start to finish.

(16:55 - 17:07)
It's important we have a general sense of what we're trying to accomplish here. Let's make some simple distinctions right from the start. The leg lock system has a definite structure.

(17:07 - 17:38)
There's the general system, the system overall, which is part of the jiu-jitsu system overall. For zoi jiu-jitsu on the one hand, there's a leg lock system within that and within the general leg lock system, there are three subsystems. Probably the single best way that we can start the ball rolling is to talk about what is the general leg lock system and what are the six essential skills of heel hooking.

(17:39 - 17:53)
Let's understand first, let's bring in some kind of precision when we talk about a leg lock system. Leg locking is just a generic term. It means any form of lock that is applied to my opponent's legs.

(17:55 - 18:06)
To be honest with you, what I teach is not a leg locking system per se. It's an ashi garami system. Remember, there are many forms of leg lock that don't involve ashi garami at all.

(18:06 - 18:21)
In fact, my friend Renato Fari is famous for applying a certain kind of leg lock which doesn't involve ashi garami at all. Really, what I teach is an ashi garami system. Remember, there are many forms of leg lock that don't involve ashi garami at all.

(18:22 - 18:48)
What I did is I focused upon what I believe are the most high percentage forms of leg locking when they're allowed, at least in competition, which is heel hooking. For mechanical reasons, which I'll outline later, I believe that heel hooking is probably the most efficient way of attacking an experienced opponent's legs, one with the highest percentage chance of success. And I believe the statistics back me up on this.

(18:48 - 19:13)
If you look at international competition where heel hooks are permitted, you will see that for every time people tap to other forms of leg lock, they'll tap 100 times to heel hooks. So we've got, on the one hand, the general leg lock system, which encapsulates six distinct skills which you will have to master and which I will teach in the course of this DVD. Within that general system, there are three distinct subsystems.

(19:15 - 19:45)
These are, I'll demonstrate with Kama Saru, three families of ashi garami. The way of breaking ashi garami down, which I'm going to show you, is the one which I taught to all of my students. There are different ways I could teach an ashi garami system, but it's my belief that the three subsystem method, which I use with my students and which I'm going to use with you now, is probably the clearest and easiest way to understand what would otherwise be a very large amount of information.

(19:46 - 20:02)
The first family, the first subsystem, are so-called straight ashi garamis. A straight ashi garami is any situation where two of my legs... You should know, by the way, ashi garami is a generic term. It just means entangled legs.

(20:02 - 20:22)
Typically, it refers to a situation where two of my legs control one of my opponent's legs. So there's a sense of mechanical advantage that I should always have some kind of control advantage over my opponent because two of my legs are controlling one of his. So even if he were considerably larger and stronger than me, in theory, at least two of my legs should be stronger than one of my opponent's legs.

(20:24 - 20:42)
There are three main forms of ashi garami. The first are the so-called straight ashi garami attacks, where Kama Saru's left leg goes over my right hip so that his leg stays on one side of my centre line. So within this family, there are many variations.

(20:43 - 21:05)
So for example, I might have what many people refer to as a standing ashi garami, or a primi ashi garami, as I call it. From here, I could bring my feet to the inside, like so. Still, the leg is going across my right hip, so we're still within the framework of a straight ashi garami system, but I've changed my ashi garami now to a senkaku with my feet locked inside.

(21:06 - 21:19)
I could have my feet locked on the outside. Still, we're in a straight ashi garami situation, but the nature of my ashi garami has changed. So we saw three variations of a straight ashi garami.

(21:20 - 21:32)
This stands in contrast to a cross ashi garami. In a cross ashi garami, my opponent's leg goes across my centre line. His right leg goes across my right hip.

(21:32 - 21:45)
And within this context, there are many different variations. I can have my feet close together like so, inside my opponent's legs. I can have my feet over my opponent's legs, over the far hip.

(21:46 - 21:59)
I can have my feet locked in a triangle with my feet to the inside. I can have my feet locked in a triangle with a foot to the outside. These are all cross ashi garami, but different variations within that family.

(22:00 - 22:18)
A third form of ashi garami is the so-called reverse ashi garami. This is the only form of ashi garami where I face the same direction as my opponent. Every other ashi garami, I face towards my opponent.

(22:18 - 22:29)
In this one, I face away from my opponent. From here, I have one leg caught between mine. In this framework, there are many variations, but they're all held together by a common thread.

(22:29 - 22:40)
The idea that we both face the same direction. I face away from my opponent in the same direction he's facing. This stands in contrast to all the other forms of ashi garami where I always face my opponent.

(22:42 - 23:09)
We have then a general system of leg locking which encapsulates six distinct skills that are put into a slightly flexible sequence. Within that general framework, there are three distinct subsystems. Straight ashi garami family, cross ashi garami family, and reverse ashi garami family.

(23:10 - 23:45)
You will be expected to learn and master all three of these subsystems in the context of a general system if you're going to call yourself competent in leg locking. We looked at the idea of a general theory of leg locking. We saw that it encapsulates six distinct skills, six essential skills, without which you can't really call yourself a competent leg locker, at least with heel hooks.

(23:45 - 24:14)
The first of these, and the element which starts off or gets the ball rolling with leg locking, is always step number one, attaining a grip and inside position. Everything in the sport of jiu jitsu begins with a grip. In the case of ashi garami based leg locks, the other element is inside positioning of my feet.

(24:15 - 25:52)
Or my knees. Let's have a look at the idea of grip and inside position as the first essential skill in our general leg lock system. We need to be highly competent in the use of ashi garami in both top and bottom position.

We're going to start in bottom position. That's where the practical study of ashi garami and heel hooking is going to begin. Before we can begin that, we need to study the idea of getting some form of working grip upon my opponent.

Until I grip my opponent and come to grips with him, I can't control him. One of the big themes of our DVD is the idea of gaining control over opponent's movement and then from there working our way into submission holds. But everything begins with control.

The only way one human being can control another is through some kind of physical contact. In the case of jiu jitsu, that means through grip. Gripping is the first skill that you will get to utilise in any competition or sparring scenario.

Until you get to grips with your opponent, nothing is going to happen. The question is, how are we going to use grip in the most effective fashion? A large part of that will depend upon how my opponent is positioned as he goes to make contact with me. We're going to start in a situation where my opponent is on two knees in front of me and I'm working from underneath from a seated butterfly guard situation.

(25:57 - 26:15)
One of the most important forms of gripping for advantage that we can work with is the idea of a two-on-one grip. If I simply grip my opponent in a generic fashion like so, I haven't really exercised any kind of advantage. There's nothing intrinsically advantageous about my grip.

(26:15 - 28:08)
One of my hands is gripping one of my opponent's hands. If he proves to be stronger than me, he can pull away and move on. Moreover, the very nature of gripping has to be understood here.

The human hand is set up in such a way that it has strong zones and weak zones. The weakness of any grip when I go to grab my opponent's hands and wrists is through the area between my thumb and my fingers. That represents the weak zone of my grip.

If I hold my hand like so, you can see a space between my thumb and my fingers. That's the space of escape for my opponent. If he pulls his wrist in the direction my thumb is pointing, he will easily escape from my grip.

If he went the opposite way, he would never escape because he's going into my hand. If he goes vertically upwards, he's going into my thumb. If he goes vertically downwards, he's going into the strength of my fingers.

If he goes out in the direction my thumb points, he escapes easily. He's exploiting the very nature of the human hand and its weaknesses. Whenever I go to employ a two-on-one grip upon my opponent, I have to cover the weak zone of my hands.

The only way I can do this is through the use of two-on-one gripping. So, when someone comes in and goes to escape from a given grip, I know ahead of time that's the zone of weakness. It's revealed by the direction of my thumb.

My thumb points towards the weak zone of the grip. What I need to do is cover that zone of weakness with the other hand. The easiest way for you to understand this is that I always want my thumbs pointing in opposite directions.

So, when Kyle Massara goes to pull away from me and I put a second hand on here, that's the weak zone shown by my left thumb pointing out here. I cover it with the right hand. Now, when Kyle Massara goes to pull away from me, it's shockingly difficult.

(28:09 - 29:02)
For the first time, I'm using one hand to get an initial grip and I'm covering the weaknesses of that hand with my other. So, I have two hands on one in a way where it's quite difficult for my opponent to pull away from me. When Kyle Massara goes to pull away, I don't want to sit still and resist his pull.

Kyle, just explosively pull your elbow back to your own body. He can eventually pull out. I never want to stay still against my opponent's pull.

Let's look at the result. Eventually, he'll pull no matter how tightly I hold on. Whenever someone goes to pull, I want to move with their pull.

So, if he goes to pull, I want to pull my body in so I shorten the distance between us. Remember, if I'm pulling back and he pulls in, that's the inevitable result. Once I get my grip, I must be sensitive to the duration of his resistance.

(29:03 - 30:22)
So, I catch a grip. I see him go to pull away and I move with the pull. As a result, my grip is retained and from here, I can start to play my attacking game.

Another example of this would be when Kyle Massara was standing. This time, I use a different form of two-on-one gripping. I start with a down grip.

My thumb points downwards. Now, you should know by now where is the zone of weakness. It's always revealed by the direction of my thumb.

If Kyle Massara pulls his hand in that direction, he easily escapes. If he tries to push towards me, my hand easily holds him. If he tries to go vertically up, I easily hold him.

If he goes vertically down, again I can hold him. But when he goes in the direction my thumb is pointing, he easily escapes. So, two-on-one gripping.

One thumb pointing against the other. He goes to pull away now. It's exceptionally difficult.

One of my hands is asserting the grip and the second hand is covering the weakness of the first hand. When I use my hands in this two-on-one fashion, you can create extraordinary gripping pressure. Often, when students visit the gym or we're in competition and opponents come up to talk to us afterwards, a common theme that they all express is that my students have extraordinary grip strength.

(30:23 - 31:54)
It's not that they have extraordinary grip strength. It's that they know what they're doing when they grip. Every time they go to make a grip, the first thing they do is they cover the weakness of the initial grip with the second hand.

This is a crucial, crucial theme in gripping and it's best done through the use of two-on-one grips. We'll be spending quite a bit of time on the idea of two-on-one grips. We're starting with what we call two-on-one wrist grips.

Here, I have a two-on-one down grip. My hand goes down towards the floor. I reinforce it with the second hand, making sure my thumbs point in opposite directions so that the weakness of one hand is covered by the other.

When Kamasara goes to pull away, it's shockingly difficult. Now we're going to add a second crucial concept to the idea of gripping, the concept of the immovable elbow. What is the immovable elbow? One of the strongest structures of the human body is when I bring my own elbow to my hips.

Let's do an experiment, Kamasara. We're going to link hands like so. I'm going to bring my elbow to my hip, just like so.

When Kamasara walks backwards and lifts, my whole body will come off the floor before my elbow leaves my hip. If you want to feel strong to another human being through grip, bring your elbow close to your own hip. This utilises all of the powerful left muscles in the back, some of the strongest muscles in the human body.

(31:54 - 33:03)
When Kamasara pulls me, I will lose my balance before my elbow comes off my hip. So I want to create a strong gripping structure. One of the best things I can do is, once I assert grips, is to bring my elbows to my own hips.

So when I work from a down position and I catch my opponent's hand, I not only reinforce one hand with the other, I close my elbows to my hips. When Kamasara goes to pull away from me, my whole body will move before the grip breaks. I can create the illusion of immense gripping strength.

Not because I'm strong, but because I'm gripping properly. I'm taking advantage of these subtle elements of gripping that prove to be so important when we enter into the leg lock game. We saw earlier that whenever someone goes to pull away from me, I never stay still and pull against them.

If I stay still and he yanks, yanks, yanks, yanks, eventually he's going to break out. Instead, standing square, when my opponent goes to pull away from me, I walk with them. I never resist a pull by pulling back and remaining stationary.

(33:04 - 35:37)
I move in the same direction as my opponent's pull. He's down on two knees. We saw from a two-on-one up grip, my opponent goes to yank away, I move in with the pull.

He goes to stand up, walks away, I move with the pull. Eventually, we're going to get opportunities to disrupt his balance, etc. Some keynote themes.

Whenever I go to grip, whatever grip I employ, whatever initial grip I employ, will always have a weak zone that my opponent can exploit. My job is to cover that weak zone with my second hand. Then, when my opponent goes to apply ever-increasing amounts of force to break the grips, my job is to go into strong structures, usually involving elbows to my own hips.

And then the third element is the idea of moving with my opponent's resistance. I don't remain stationary and turn it into a pulling match of my strength against his. Rather, I simply move with my opponent's pull.

I can dissipate the force of my opponent's rearward pull to retain an attachment to my opponent. So we've seen this critical idea of two-on-one gripping. So far, we've only been working with two-on-one wrist grips.

We've identified two main forms of gripping. When I go to grip the wrist, my two main options are two-on-one up grips, where my thumbs point upwards towards the ceiling, like so. These are especially useful for drawing my opponent out of balance and getting hands over my shoulders.

When they're used in conjunction with my butterfly hooks, Kamasara goes to pull away, I can get people up and out of balance, get hands on the floor, from where we can start to go on their neck. When my opponent is standing, typically now we'll use two-on-one down grips, where my thumbs and the palms of my hand point downwards to the floor. When my opponent goes to pull away, I connect everything to my hips.

As he goes to walk, walk, walk, we go with our opponent's walk until we can start disrupting their balance, etc. So the first family of grips that we employ is upon our opponent's wrists, specifically two-on-one up grips and two-on-one down grips. Now, one of the most important forms of two-on-one gripping works with exactly the same principle.

(35:38 - 35:51)
This is the two-on-one elbow grip. We'll look at it first in the case of a medium opponent. If I grip my opponent like so, we've already seen the idea of a zone of weakness.

(35:51 - 36:42)
It's easily identified in a human grip by the direction that my thumb points. If my opponent pulls his hand in that direction, he easily escapes. We saw we could cover that by using two-on-one wrist grips.

Another excellent option is the two-on-one elbow grip. Here, I put my hand like so and slide it down my opponent's arm and hold at the bony growth that occurs at the end of the upper arm where it meets the forearm. If I just hold with one hand, Kato Misawa can easily identify the zone of weakness.

It's shown by the direction of my thumb and he pulls his arm in that direction, he easily escapes. If I just hold here, he identifies the zone of weakness and pulls his hand and easily escapes. But if I hold both together, the weakness of one is covered by the strength of the other.

(36:43 - 40:15)
As Kato Misawa goes to pull away from me, it's shockingly difficult. In addition, it's very easy for me to use the principle of the elbows close to my hip. In this position, my elbows are almost immovable.

In addition, I can bring in another concept, the concept of the centre line. If I can take my opponent's arm across my centre line so that his right hand connects to my right hip, this greatly weakens my opponent's ability to pull away from me. When he goes to yank away, it's shockingly difficult and you feel like you have much greater strength than perhaps you really do.

When my opponent goes to yank away, I have two free feet which I can use in any number of ways to go into various forms of attack. So even though my hands are occupied, my feet are free. This grip sends a huge advantage in any grip and into attack situation.

If my opponent is standing, exactly the same things are true. I grip, I grip again. When Kato Misawa goes to pull away, I connect everything close to the chest, he goes walking, walking, walking.

We've seen, we dissipate, walking, walking. We dissipate the force by moving with him. If I stay still and push off the floor and he pulls, eventually he'll break away.

But when I see him walking and pulling and I move with him, I can easily hold on to my opponent until I trip him down to the mat. We've been looking at this idea of gripping for effect. So far, we've focused only upon the mechanics of gripping.

We've seen one of the most important families of gripping is the idea of two-on-one gripping. The notion we're working with is that any given initial grip has a weakness inherent in the very nature of the human body and our job is to cover those initial weaknesses with the second hand or the second arm. In this way, we can make it extraordinarily difficult for our opponent to do well in any grip fight situation.

We've also seen a key mechanical concept, the idea of the of the immovable elbow. Whenever my elbow is close to my hips, it's extraordinarily difficult for my opponent to break that structure and start to extend me. My whole body will be dragged off the ground before my elbows leave my hips.

We've also seen a third key element, the idea of not resisting a pull or a push, but rather going with it to dissipate the force that our opponent is trying to apply on us. Now, getting away from mechanics, we're going to start looking at some conceptual elements. It is absolutely crucial whenever we study the grip game that we have a clear notion of gripping for a purpose.

So often, I see athletes gripping just for the sake of gripping. They get grips without any clear sense of what exactly they're trying to do. It is absolutely crucial that when I get a grip upon an opponent, I have a clear sense of what am I trying to accomplish.

In my case, the number one goal I have in any grip fighting situation is to first establish a working contact upon my opponent that shuts down their ability to be dangerous to me. When I work against someone in a situation like this, I know what his intention is. His intention is to get past my legs into my upper body.

(40:15 - 42:37)
So, for example, if a commissary posts a hand on my shoulder and pushes and throws my legs to the side, this would be a good example of him clearing my legs out to the side and getting into a dominant upper body position. I know what he wants. A big part of what I'm trying to do is to shut down his game and then assert my own game.

When I go to grip someone, my number one priority is to shut down his game and then assert my own. So, when I get a two-on-one grip on my opponent and lock in like so, when he goes into any kind of guard passing scenario, he can't even begin until he clears this grip. Until he clears this grip, he's not passing my guard.

I don't care what he does. So, there's a sense in which by establishing a grip upon him and taking away one of his two arms, he has to address that problem first before he can even begin to do what he wanted to do, which was to get past my legs. So, in that sense, I've taken the initiative upon my opponent.

Almost every guard pass in the sport of Jiu-Jitsu involves the use of two arms. There are very, very few high-percentage one-handed guard passes. I know that.

And so, if I tie up one of my opponent's arms, I know he's not passing my guard until he's addressed this problem successfully. Now, he's reacting to my grip. And off that reaction, there's so many things I can go into work with.

By taking a decisive, intimidating grip at the outset of the action, I've immediately stopped his game plan in its tracks. He can't begin passing my guard until he frees my grip. That means immediately he's a step behind me.

From there, we can start to assert our own game. And that game is one based around the notion of Kizushi, or breaking my opponent's balance. My goal, whenever I get grips on people, is first, shut down their game, and second, assert my arm.

The number one way in which I do this is to get my opponent's hands to the floor. If my opponent's hands are on the floor, that means they're not passing my legs, they're not going after any submission hold on me, etc. So my whole thing, once I get a grip, whether it be two-on-one elbow, whether it be two-on-one wrist, variations like so, is always to get his hands on the mat.

(42:38 - 42:49)
And that means I have to start using my feet. So, for example, my opponent goes in in a kind of a generic start situation, looking like so. I'll go in, I'll get that two-on-one grip.

(42:49 - 44:10)
Kamosawa goes to yank away from me, and from here I bring my body in, the legs start lifting, and what have we got? Two hands on the floor. Kamosawa is standing over me. From here, he goes to break grips.

From here, it's an easy thing to put hands and hips on the floor. However we go, that's always the simple sequence that starts and finishes the grip fighting game. One, get some form of efficient grip, and we're defining efficiency in terms of using two hands, where one hand covers the weakness of the other.

Use that grip first to shut down your opponent's offence. You know what he wants, he wants to get past your legs. And then third, use it in an effective, proactive fashion to get your opponent's hands or hips down to the mat.

If you can keep that sense of purpose in mind when you're going to be in any grip fighting encounter, you will be an effective gripper. You will be a gripper who works with a sense of purpose and a sense of direction, which is so important in starting the leg lock game. We're looking at the six essential skills of leg locking out of Ashi Tarana.

(44:11 - 45:12)
We've seen that the first step, the first of these six essential skills, is the idea of grip and inside position. We're looking at a general theory of gripping for effect. So far we're looking at the bottom position.

We've seen that when we have an opponent, whether he be on feet or down on two knees, one of our favourite ways to grip is to use the so-called two-on-ones. These can occur usually first at the wrists. We've seen the idea that whenever I grip my opponent's wrist, there's a zone of weakness which is easily revealed by the direction of my thumb, and my opponent can easily exploit this.

We always, when we go to take grips, want to cover that zone of weakness, whether it be with up grips like so, my palms facing up, or whether it be with down grips. We've seen an elbow two-on-one. When my opponent goes the ankle way, it's shockingly difficult, and it leaves us with two free feet which we can use to off-balance an opponent and start the action of getting my opponent's hands down to the mat.

(45:13 - 47:33)
So we're covering several things at the same time. The idea of first creating an intimidating grip that's not easy for your opponent to break. Second, negating their attempts to get past your legs, which require the use of two hands, by immobilising one of them.

And then third, getting on to the attacking game, so that we're not just gripping for the sake of gripping, but gripping for a purpose, and that purpose is to get my opponent's hands down on the mat and my opponent out of balance. Now, we've looked at one of the most important forms of initial contact, which is to seize my opponent by the wrists. That's natural, because when someone comes to fight me, typically the wrist is the closest thing to me, okay? But there's always going to be times your opponent gets his grips upon you first.

The question is, what kinds of grips? What we're going to look at now is upper body grips. If another opponent has grips on my collar or arms, like so, I want to make use of a very special grip, tricep gripping, okay? Normally, most people go to grip at the elbows, like so, okay? I generally favour a higher grip up here at the tricep, whether I be gripping my opponent's collar time or his bicep time, just like so. So rather than grip my opponent at the elbows, I like to come here, underneath the triceps, just like so.

What's so valuable about this grip is that it enables me to dominate the arm from underneath, so that when Bernardo tries to switch to a grip on my legs, he physically can't do it, because I'm underneath my opponent's arms. I don't just want to lift up, I want to take Bernardo's hands past my shoulders. So I'm always looking in these situations to draw the two arms forward and get my head into good position.

Again, I use the principle of the immovable elbow. The further my elbows from my hips, the weaker my body is. So I always want my elbows in close with good hip position.

When Bernardo tries to grab my legs, it's exceptionally difficult, because I'm dominating the area underneath the arms. So whenever someone gets upper body grips on me, my thing is to go through, take the triceps, and draw him to me. And now, it's the easiest thing for me to get hands on the floor and go to work.

(47:35 - 48:12)
Remember, whenever we go to grip, we have a negative function, which is to stop my opponent doing what he wants to do. And a positive function, which is to initiate my attacks by getting his hands to the mat. I know what he wants, he wants to pass my legs.

So for example, he can take a collar tie, and then start pushing on my legs, and carrying my legs out to the side. The moment he goes into any kind of grip, I want to prevent him from getting to my legs. So I make sure I get underneath my training partner's triceps, and I pull everything in.

(48:12 - 55:48)
When he tries to access my legs, it's so difficult and relatively easy for me to get hands on the mat. Once Bernardo's hands go to the mat, there's no question of him trying to get a hold of my legs now. He can't take his hands, otherwise he'll lose his balance.

But I, on the other hand, am extremely close now to the various forms of leg attack, which we'll be looking at later in the series. So this forms a second form of useful gripping sequence, which my students often make use of. We've looked at wrist grips, now we've looked at tricep grips.

Once again, if my partner's hands are in front of me, this is the time to go in and secure wrists. If my partner puts hands on my upper body, this is the time to go into tricep gripping. When he tries to access the legs now, it's difficult, but it's relatively easy for us to get hands on the floor and go into the many forms of attack that will be easy to take advantage of once the hands touch the floor.

Now we've been looking at a theory of gripping. We've seen that we always want, as the key theme that we're pushing here in this theory, is the idea of gripping for a purpose. So often I see talented athletes gripping, but without any real sense of what they're gripping for.

They're just getting grips for the sake of getting grips. We always want a very clear sense of direction. The first element is strength of connection.

I can't have grips that my opponent can just easily break, then I won't be effective at all. So we've seen simple mechanical methods of strengthening our grips. We've seen the idea of two-on-one coverage.

We've seen the idea of instead of gripping elbows going higher to the triceps so that we can close elbows to hip and get truly strong, useful grips. We've seen the first element to any gripping exchange is negative, which is to shut down my opponent's ability to assert his game upon me. But then we can't just play a negative game of gripping.

This is not about stopping other people from doing what they want to do. Ultimately it's about asserting yourself in positive directions to get to a submission win. We've seen that the third element after strength of grip, negation of my opponent's techniques and tactics, the third is to create openings for attack.

And the number one method to get into my opponent's legs is to get hands on the floor. Get my opponent out of balance and get hands on the floor. We've seen situations where I work with my opponent's wrists.

We've seen situations where we worked at our training partner's triceps. Now let's go into the idea of underhooks. Underhooks play a particularly important role in the leg lock game because they offer the highest percentage chance of getting in underneath my opponent and accessing the legs.

If I work with overhooks, I'm not disparaging overhooks by the way. Overhooks are fantastic for upper body attacks. They're fantastic for sweeping, but they're difficult to get the leg game to work.

If I have overhooks, even if I get my opponent's hands on the floor and elevate him, he's still underneath my arms. Let's have a look at what happens when we try to elevate someone up. Yeah, I've got his hands on the floor, but when I try to go into a leg lock game, I tend to get crunched.

It's very, very difficult for me to go successfully into my opponent's legs because his right arm is an underhook, which prevents my head from going forward and getting underneath my opponent's hips. Later on today, we're going to show that my ability to get my head underneath my opponent's hips is absolutely critical to success for bottom leg locks. Now, the problem is Bernardo's underhook is preventing my head from going forward.

The combination of his head position and the underhook gets me extended, and now a simple sprawl of his legs will take me right past any kind of ushigurami that I have and into a good position. So, working into my opponent's legs is difficult with overhooks. I'm not going to say it's impossible, but it's not high percentage.

That changes dramatically when I'm underneath my opponent's arms, particularly in situations where I'm underneath both of them. Now, when I start to elevate people from situations like this, it's very easy for me to get my opponent up into situations where his hips go directly over my head, and he's completely out of bounds. He has no ability to get underneath my arms now and save himself to stretch me out.

So, as a general rule, when we work with underhooks, we're going to have a much better chance of success to get into my opponent's legs than if I work with overhooks. Now, how we work with underhooks is very important. I have my own views on this.

My opponent's on two knees. When I work the underhook game, I try to avoid something which is very, very common. I see many people using it, which is body locks here.

Now, body locks can be extremely useful for certain purposes, but there are some problems associated with their use in this position. Bernardo can easily take a forearm and put it across my neck. So, I'm in here, and now it's easy for him to stretch out and break my grips.

Why? Because when I lock my hands here, unless I lock right behind my opponent's neck, any lock below the scapula is an easy thing to create a forearm in front and from here cause real problems to break my grip. Now, he can hold onto his own underhooks and cause problems for me. So, generally what I like to see people do is rather than lock their hands, I like to see them work with elbows pointed inwards and a hand behind the shoulder.

When my hands go down the body, in the case of double underhooks, they tend to become less effective because my opponent's head can move backwards, and that's exactly when they can start putting frames in front of me. So, I prefer to see people work like so, and the elbow dominates his elbow. When my elbow is closed, Bernardo can easily combo a forearm in front and cause problems.

So, what I'm looking to do in the underhook situation is to form a false grip with my wrist is bent 90 degrees, and my elbow dominates his elbow, and this is done on both sides. So, when Bernardo goes to move away from me, it's shockingly difficult, and from here it's an easy thing to get him elevated and hands on the floor. The question is, how are we going to get to those underhook positions? It's not easy, a talented opponent.

So, whenever someone's working in situations like this, we're going to start by placing a hand on our training partner's head and taking my second hand, pinky knuckle, up just like so, and I put my forearm over the top of my training partner's forearm. If I just try to push my hands through, Bernardo will always close his elbows and stop me from getting in. So, what I want to do in these situations is to put my hand in and I pull on the head and I shoot the first hand through, just like so.

When Bernardo goes to yank away from me, my elbow dominates his elbow. Then the second hand goes still on the other side, we get exactly the same grip and I dominate the second elbow. When Bernardo goes to pull away from me, it's surprisingly difficult.

Now, I bring the hips underneath and we start elevating. Once the hands are on the floor, we know now from here there's a thousand different ways you can go into the legs and stop the leg lock game. So, that's my favourite way to use underhook gripping to go into my opponent's legs and get hands down to the floor.


## Volume 2

(0:04 - 0:18)
We're looking at the six essential skills of working for leg locks out of Ashi Garami. These form the general system which I teach in espoused. The first skill is that of grip and inside position.

(0:19 - 0:38)
So far we've been looking at grip in some detail and looking at some key elements that enable us to get strong intimidating grip upon our opponent. The first shuts down their ability to assert themselves on us. And then second enables us to create some kind of off-balancing which opens our opponent up to attack.

(0:38 - 1:02)
Now it's time to bring in the critical concept of inside position and contrast it with inside control. It's physically impossible for me to go into any form of Ashi Garami based leg lock without some kind of inside position. Now inside position comes in different types, different grades.

(1:04 - 1:23)
The most common, the most sought after and probably for most people the most general and useful form of inside position is the use of my feet inside my opponent's knees. That's an excellent way for you to start understanding the idea of inside position. So for example if I had Kawamasaru in front of me like so.

(1:24 - 1:36)
Most of the classical guards of Jiu-Jitsu work with outside position, my feet outside my opponent's. So for example in your first days of Jiu-Jitsu you get to a closed guard. This is a classic example of outside control.

(1:37 - 1:52)
My legs are outside and around my opponent. If Kawamasaru stands up. Another good example of outside control would be Daliheba guard where my leg goes outside and around my opponent's leg and controls it from the outside.

(1:53 - 2:07)
So those would be two good examples of outside control. It is absolutely crucial that you understand this critical notion. Whenever you go to control the human body you will have two distinct choices.

(2:08 - 2:23)
You can control it from the outside or you can control it from the inside. They are both extremely effective but they work in different ways. Whenever I go to control someone's body from the inside my primary target is my opponent's centre line.

(2:23 - 2:31)
That's where I work from. And my intention is to take his limbs out and away from his centre line. The idea is simple.

(2:31 - 2:50)
The further Kawamasaru's arm goes away from his torso the weaker that arm becomes. So for example if I ask Kawamasaru to hold a dumbbell close to his body it's easy. But if I take that same dumbbell and ask him to hold it out here on an extended arm suddenly that same dumbbell feels a lot heavier.

(2:51 - 3:08)
As a general rule the further an arm or a leg gets away from the torso the weaker and more manipulable it becomes. Inside positioning is based on that principle. Whenever I control an arm from the inside here my elbow is inside his.

(3:08 - 3:17)
He's gripping me and I'm gripping him. But my elbow is inside Kawamasaru's. That means when he tries to close his elbow to his body it's difficult.

(3:17 - 3:29)
I can open it up. When I have an underarm that's another example where my elbow is inside his. When he tries to close his elbow to his own body I can prevent him from doing so and open him up.

(3:29 - 3:43)
So that his limbs are being extended out and away from the body. If I can extend someone's limbs out and away from the body I can make a strong man feel weak. I can isolate the limb, control it and ultimately submit it.

(3:45 - 4:01)
Inside control is based on this simple concept. Outside control is a very different kind of control. In outside control I control a limb from the outside and the primary thing is not the centerline but my opponent's back.

(4:02 - 4:25)
Remember the two great vulnerabilities of the human body are the centerline and the back. If I can expose my opponent's centerline I can create separation that will set up a thousand different forms of submission hold. If I can expose my opponent's back I can create situations where I'm inherently having taste because I'm behind my opponent and able to attack.

(4:26 - 4:58)
So whenever I go to control a human being that's the fundamental choice that I get to make. Will I control him from the outside which generally threatens the back? Or will I control him from the inside which primarily works by isolating a limb and weakens it by taking it out and away from the torso? Almost all of the leg-locking game and especially the ashi-gurami game is based on the notion of inside control. Where we try to take our opponent's limbs, in this case the legs, and separate them one from the other and extend them out and away from the torso.

(4:59 - 5:15)
If we can do that we can go to work. The most fundamental form of inside positioning is my feet inside my opponent's knees. This gives us an ability to lift and elevate an opponent.

(5:15 - 5:29)
If he puts his leg up my foot is on the inside. It's the easiest thing in the world for me to start an action of lifting, elevating, and going into my opponent's legs. If my legs are on the outside I simply cannot do that.

(5:30 - 5:41)
On the contrary, it's very easy now for Kawasaki to pick my leg up. It's not sliding into my legs and threatening me. So inside position has both an offensive and a defensive component.

(5:41 - 6:00)
If my feet are inside my opponent's legs there's almost no ashi-gurami game he can play on me. But I, on the other hand, can play ashi-gurami here all day. So whenever I want to assert a strong ashi-gurami game on an opponent an excellent place for us to start is two feet inside our opponent's knees.

(6:03 - 6:13)
I can also play an ashi-gurami game with one foot inside. However, I'm starting to limit my options. There's fewer ashi-gurami entrances I can use in this position.

(6:14 - 6:31)
In addition, I can attack him with ashi-gurami but he can also start to attack me now. So it's starting to go in both directions. If neither one of us has a foot inside there's things I can do from here but it's more difficult for me to enter into ashi-gurami from bottom position.

(6:31 - 6:47)
What I can't do is enter into any ashi-gurami where he has inside positioning and I have none. That's where he can attack me with ashi-gurami and I can't attack him. So we're always looking to get our feet as much as possible to the inside position.

(6:48 - 7:04)
It's very, very important we understand the distinction between inside position and inside control. Just because my feet are on the inside doesn't mean I control my opponent. It's pretty easy for Kawamasara to put his knee inside mine and now he's stolen the inside position from me.

(7:05 - 7:21)
I don't control the inside position until there's an effective, meaningful contact. Which means I must use the shoelaces of my feet to hook actively into my opponent's legs. Now when Kawamasara goes to step inside my feet stick to the back of his knees.

(7:21 - 7:36)
If Kawamasara stands up from here I actively stick into my training partner's legs. As a result I can start to move an off-balance feet in ways that set up various forms of leg attack. I would say this again because it's so important.

(7:37 - 7:50)
Just because you have inside position doesn't mean you have inside control. Inside position is the prerequisite but inside control is the goal. Inside control is defined very simply.

(7:51 - 8:10)
That's when my feet determine my opponent's ability to move his legs relative to each other. If my opponent stands up and I have my feet positioned on the inside, here there's no tension transmitted into my opponent's legs. So Kawamasara can easily pommel a leg to the inside and now he has inside control on one side.

(8:12 - 8:34)
Contrast that with a situation where I actively put tension into my opponent's legs. When he goes to pommel in my legs follow his movements and as a result from here it's very easy for me to go to work. You start with inside position but ultimately you want to be able to control the space between your opponent's knees.

(8:35 - 8:53)
This is a very very important concept. Remember we're defining inside control as the ability to determine and control the space between your opponent's knees. Because that space is the space through which you're going to have to enter to go into the leg lock game.

(8:53 - 9:27)
If you cannot control that space you will not leg lock anybody. Whenever we grip up on my training partner my whole thing is to get his feet and actively hook them in to my opponent's knees. So when Kawamasara goes to pommel, move, etc.

he feels the whole time the space between his knees is being controlled by me. If I can do that I can go immediately into my leg locks. If I can't it's the easiest thing in the world for my opponent to pommel legs out and start to escape and go into his own moves.

(9:35 - 9:45)
Gripping comes with the gripping game from bottom position. We've seen in keynote elements the idea of gripping with a purpose. There are two critical purposes in any gripping exchange.

(9:46 - 9:58)
The first is to shut down my opponent's ability to impose his attacks upon me. That's the negative side of gripping. Then is the positive side which is to set up my own proactive attacks upon my opponent.

(9:59 - 10:15)
As a general rule we start with the negative and then work our way into the positive. We looked at it from bottom position, now let's start to look at it in the case of top position. Whenever I go into an engaging opponent who's in a seated position there's a lot of danger as I go to approach my opponent.

(10:16 - 10:27)
I can't be naive in the way in which I approach my opponent. I can't come in with an upright body and leave my legs open for my opponent to go straight into my legs. Now he can go into all kinds of sweeps, all kinds of leg attacks, whatever he wants.

(10:28 - 10:44)
So how I approach my opponent and how I use grip to make the action of approaching him safer is extremely important. Let's understand that the first element here is a game of distance. The critical demarcation lines that we work with are my opponent's toe line.

(10:44 - 10:57)
That's the line that goes across my opponent's two big toes. And his knee line, which is the line that joins my training partner's two knees. Those are my two demarcation lines that I use when I go to play the distance game.

(10:57 - 11:13)
The moment I start to stick beyond the toe line, Bernardo Fari can easily get a hold of me and establish inside position with his foot. Like that. So when I go to approach the toe line I have to do so in a way which is relatively safe for me.

(11:13 - 11:29)
The third critical line of demarcation that I work with when I go to approach an opponent in a seated position is my opponent's centre line. If I step outside of the centre line I have given my opponent the inside position, which is going to be crucial for the leg lock game. That's a bad move on my part.

(11:30 - 11:54)
So the three lines that we work with are my opponent's toe line, which joins his big toes, the knee line, which joins his two knees, and my opponent's centre line, which will determine the battle for inside control. When I go to approach my opponent I can do so in two main ways. The first is the so-called bent over method, or a kind of defensive stance which we often refer to as a Jigotai.

(11:55 - 12:15)
In Jigotai I move towards my opponent and I match my head level with my opponent's head level. If my head is significantly higher than my opponent's it leaves my legs open to my opponent's attacks. So the first thing I do is I judge distance by staying away from the toe line, and I put my foot out wide and I match my head level with my opponent's head level.

(12:16 - 12:38)
From a situation like this there is sufficient distance from my opponent that if he wanted to move towards me it would be immediately obvious and I could play the distance game around him. He can't simply grab me, he would have to move first before he grabs me. When I go to move forward on my opponent I'm going to do so behind the safety of a thumb post.

(12:38 - 12:56)
In a thumb post I take my thumb, I turn my palm down, and I post my thumb inside my opponent's shoulder, just like so. Then I take my hand on the same side as the leg that I'm going to put forward. In my case it's going to be my right leg.

(12:57 - 13:11)
So off my thumb post I post it like so. I cross grip my training partner's wrist. Why is that important? My opponent requires at least one arm to go in for his various attacks from bottom position.

(13:12 - 13:24)
Usually the best arm he can employ is the arm that controls my forward leg. So my right leg is best controlled by his left arm. That's the usual order of operations.

(13:24 - 13:37)
If my opponent goes in with this arm, that tends to expose his back to me. That would be something of a mistake on his part. So as a general rule, if I step forward with my right leg, he's best off using his left arm to control me.

(13:38 - 13:51)
Knowing this, we can start to enforce a gripping game. As I move in towards my opponent, my first game is a distance game. Where I stay at such a distance that if Bernardo wanted to initiate contact with me, he would have to move.

(13:52 - 14:03)
And I can simply move away from him. So by using distance, I can determine who makes contact first. Is it him or me? Because I'm standing, I have a mobility advantage.

(14:03 - 14:15)
Because I'm at a distance where he has to move, I can prevent him from getting working grips on me until I want him to. So that's the first phase of gripping, is distance. The second phase is control.

(14:16 - 14:31)
Positioning myself on my training partner's centre arm, I put in the thumb post. What's so special about a thumb post? A thumb post gives me an ability to attack and negate his stance. My opponent wants his head over his knee line.

(14:31 - 14:39)
That's what's good for him. I want his head over his hips. The moment I put the head over the hips, his feet become light.

(14:39 - 14:55)
And as a result, we can start to negate our opponent's legs. So when I move in on my opponent, I come in and I put a thumb post on my training partner. It's hard for my opponent to get any kind of proactive gripping going on him because he's working through the thumb post.

(14:55 - 15:06)
If he goes to remove the thumb post, it's easy for me to take it off and reassert. He takes a hand, I can take it off and reassert. In this way, I can start to play a grip game.

(15:07 - 15:15)
I don't just naively come out and put my hand here and stop. I think that's obviously not a good idea. I work from here behind my thumb post.

(15:15 - 15:31)
If I see him controlling it, I'll take it off, etc. Now ultimately, I want to tie up his left arm because I want to put my right foot forward. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put in my thumb post and I'm going to take a cross grip on my training partner.

(15:31 - 15:45)
On the side that he requires. Now I use my thumb post to open space and I step boldly into my opponent's knee line. When he tries to get grips on me, it's very, very difficult.

(15:46 - 15:57)
He needs this hand here to grip me, but I'm holding it. When he tries to maintain his stance, it's a difficult thing. And now we have this high position with our foot and we're ready to play a leg locking game.

(15:58 - 16:04)
Done. Once again. My first weapon in this grip fight is distance.

(16:04 - 16:18)
My second is stance. With stance, my head aligns with his head. With distance, I'm so far away from his toe line that if he wanted to move towards me, it would take time and I could move at the time a lot.

(16:20 - 16:34)
My mechanism of control is the thumb post. I post on my training partner's body and I snatch the wrist on the side that I ultimately want to go forward with. When I unweight my opponent's legs, it gives me space to step into.

(16:35 - 16:44)
And from here, it's certainly where it's not that we can work with inside position. You'll see that my right leg is now in the inside position. Done.

(16:44 - 17:13)
So this is one excellent way for us to use gripping and tactics to initiate contact in a way which first negates my opponent's ability to attack me and then sets me up with some form of inside position from which I can work a leg locking game. Okay, we're looking at the idea of grip fighting from top position. We're looking in the context of our general theory of grip fighting.

(17:13 - 17:25)
Grip fighting has to have certain elements involved. First is the idea of developing an imposing grip. We've got to have an effective grip that our opponents can't break easily and which has some kind of effect on our opponent.

(17:25 - 17:37)
The effect we're looking for first is a negative effect. That is the ability to shut down what he wants to do to me. I can't try to impose my game upon my opponent while he is actively imposing his game upon me.

(17:38 - 17:54)
So our first thing is to negate his game so that we can then go into the next step which is to impose our own game upon them. Whenever two people are trying to impose their game upon each other at the same time it rapidly turns into a dogfight. What we want is first to shut them down and then impose our own game.

(17:54 - 18:03)
That's always the general sense in which we work our gripping game. And that way we can be said to be gripping for a purpose. We're not just coming out and touching people for no reason.

(18:04 - 18:16)
We come out with a definite sense of what we want to accomplish with the grips that we have. We just looked at one way to assert grips against someone in a seated guard position when we were on top. Let's now start looking at others.

(18:17 - 18:32)
We've seen that before we even begin to establish grips in a standing position there is a distance game that has to be played. We've seen that there are certain critical demarcation lines which make my job a lot easier. The first is the notion of a toe line.

(18:32 - 18:45)
Once I step to my opponent's toe line I am in a position where he can grab me now with feet and hands without really moving. He can make contact very, very quickly. So I've got to be very careful how I approach that toe line.

(18:46 - 19:02)
I generally want to do so in a way which is relatively safe. One way I can do this is to make sure that my stance is matched head level to head level. When my head level is down in front of my opponent and he goes to move in towards me even if he went in to make contact my head makes it difficult for him.

(19:02 - 19:11)
Because I'm standing if he went for a snap down to a guillotine it's difficult because of the distance. It's hard for him to get in on me. If I was down here and he snapped me down that's a problem.

(19:12 - 19:20)
But in a standing situation it's much more difficult. I can easily circle out. Now once we're in this position we want to go in on our opponent.

(19:21 - 19:30)
I'm too far away for any kind of attack unless he moves towards me. If I stood like this too close he could easily arm drag me and do all kinds of things from here. So distance is our first weapon.

(19:32 - 19:48)
Once I understand the notion of moving towards the toe line safely In the previous move we worked with the idea of a thumb post which made it relatively safe for me to start entering in towards my opponent. We saw the idea of tying up a wrist. This time my opponent is playing smart with his wrist.

(19:48 - 19:55)
He's keeping the wrist back and away from me. He's keeping the wrist back and away from me. So every time I try to grab his wrist he's pulling away.

(19:56 - 20:06)
Every time I lose a wrist I gain opportunities for ankles. My opponent has two choices. He can either have his hands forward to protect his ankles.

(20:07 - 20:16)
That's one thing. Now I can't grab his ankles because his hands are grabbing mine. Or he can pull his hands away and leave ankles.

(20:17 - 20:27)
So if the hands are forward I can't get the ankles but I can get the hands. He pulls the hands away now I can get to the ankles. I come in and I grip.

(20:27 - 20:39)
I don't lift up. This is a common mistake. People try to grip and lift.

You can't. What I do is I pull and then I lift. So I bring the toes and show the direction.

(20:40 - 20:52)
The direction of the force is shown by the toes. Once Bernardo pulls his hands away from me I come in and I pull the feet in the direction the toes are pointing. As a result we quickly get the shoulders to the mat.

(20:53 - 21:03)
Immediately I put a foot on the centre line. So that when Bernardo comes back up I have the inside position. We're ready to play the inside game.

(21:07 - 21:19)
Essentially I create a dilemma for my opponent. I move up to a distance where I'm relatively safe. Then I play a game with my opponent's wrists.

(21:19 - 21:30)
I put in my thumb post and I attack wrists. If he pulls wrists away from me he can only do so by exposing ankles. If he keeps wrists in front then I receive a previous move.

(21:31 - 21:39)
I receive it on my opponent. So I play him between his wrists and his ankles. From here I come down and he pulls away from me.

(21:39 - 21:47)
Now I grip and I don't lift up. I pull along. Only when his feet are almost between my legs do I put him down.

(21:48 - 22:07)
When he tries to come back up he surrenders the inside position. Now from here we have at least one leg inside. We're looking at the first critical skill of heel hooking from Ashi Barani positions.

(22:07 - 22:16)
The idea of establishing grips and inside position. We've seen from bottom position how to do this. At least some elements from bottom position.

(22:16 - 22:26)
Now we're looking at the question of top position. Let's start to transition now from simple gripping into pommeling to inside position. If we have an opponent in a supine position.

(22:27 - 22:38)
He's down on his back and he has inside position from here. He has both of his feet inside my knees. This is a huge advantage for him as far as entering into the leg lock game.

(22:39 - 22:50)
Currently I have nothing inside. So I literally cannot do any form of Ashi Barani game from this position. I need to learn the skill of pommeling my legs into an inside position.

(22:51 - 23:04)
How are we going to do this? Eric's going to give us the lead. The problem is that Bernardo is doing a good job of bringing his toes. He doesn't just have inside position, he has inside control.

(23:04 - 23:16)
If he moves his leg in this direction, he will take me out of balance in that direction. If he moves his leg in this direction, he will take me out of balance in that direction. He's not just positioning his feet, he's controlling the space between my knees.

(23:17 - 23:37)
You can always tell when the space between the knees is being controlled by the direction of my kneecaps. When my kneecaps point in opposite directions, you know he's controlling the space. Whenever we engage in a pommeling game, I need to change the orientation of my kneecaps.

(23:39 - 23:53)
The only way I can do that, he makes tight grips with his feet. I'm going to take my hands and post them on my training partner's shins. I'm going to push his shin just below my knee, and watch my knee.

(23:54 - 24:06)
I'm going to turn my knee straight into his shin. When he goes to lift my leg now, it's very different. When my kneecap faces outwards and he lifts in this direction, he easily off-balances me.

(24:07 - 24:21)
So when I want to start a pommeling engagement with my opponent, I need to be able to turn my knees inwards. I can't do that when he's inside my knee. So my first step is to push the shin down and put my kneecap on top of his shin.

(24:22 - 24:38)
Once I've done that, it's the easiest thing in the world for me to pommel my foot to the inside position. He does the same thing on the other side. I push my training partner's shin down, I turn my knee inwards, and now I can easily pommel to an inside position.

(24:39 - 25:02)
Now, when Bernardo goes to close his knees, I have the inside position. And what's happened to Bernardo's knees? They are now pointing in opposite directions, which means that now it's me who's controlling the inside space. If I put a hand on the floor and a hand in here, when Bernardo tries to point his knees towards each other, I'm controlling the space between his knees.

(25:03 - 25:19)
And that's our general rule. As a coach, I can look across a room and I can tell who's got inside control and who doesn't by that simple visual cue. Where are their kneecaps pointing? That's a simple way of assessing who's controlling the inside position and who isn't.

(25:20 - 25:32)
Let's have a look at this again. Bernardo currently has inside position. I'll go further and say not only does he have inside position, the moment he starts putting tension in my legs, he now has inside control.

(25:32 - 25:46)
You can easily see this by the act of lifting, taking me out of balance. Lifting and taking me out of balance. You can see that my knees are pointing away from each other, which means he's controlling the space between my knees.

(25:47 - 25:57)
So I put my hand on here, at the shin, strongly. I push down and I turn my knee. So my two knees are now facing the same direction.

(25:58 - 26:10)
When my knees face the same direction and Bernardo goes to move me, it's just not the same. And as a result, I can easily pommel to an inside position. Now I do the same on the other side.

(26:12 - 26:27)
And as a result, when he goes to bring his knees together, his knees are pointing in opposite directions. And it's a relatively easy thing for me to make sure they stay that way. When Bernardo tries to bring his knees to face the same direction, I control the space between the knees.

(26:27 - 27:02)
And as a result, I control the leg-locking game. Let's look at three very, very important positions which can be made part of a simple daily drill, which teach you the most desirable to the less desirable positions to enter into leg-locking. When someone's in a supine position, and the least desirable position for me to be, if I want to enter into the leg-locking game through Ashigurami, is with him two feet inside.

(27:02 - 27:16)
That leaves me almost no options, and him a vast number of options. This is the worst. The best is where I have two feet in the inside position.

(27:16 - 27:33)
Because now I can attack either leg in many different ways. A decent option, pretty good, is for me to have one foot inside. When I have one foot inside, I can backstep into my opponent's legs.

(27:34 - 27:53)
I can step over into my opponent's legs. There's a range of ways I can attack here. So, for example, if I put one foot in the inside position here, a simple Kani-Gosami type action, where I bring my opponent's knee down, and then slide into my opponent's legs, is a wonderful attacking option.

(27:55 - 28:17)
If I have one leg inside, like so, I can stop the leg, control the knee, and then from here I can bring my body across my opponent's body, and go into my opponent's legs. You notice, however, that I can only attack one of my opponent's legs. When I have two feet inside, I can attack either leg in many different ways.

(28:18 - 28:31)
Now, I can only attack one leg in two ways. In addition, when I have just one leg inside, it's possible for my opponent to throw his legs through and around, and now he can attack me in this position. So we can both attack each other.

(28:31 - 28:40)
So it's good, but not as good as two legs inside. Another position is no legs inside. He has no legs inside, and I have no legs inside.

(28:41 - 28:57)
So essentially it's neutral. But in a situation like this, I can easily move, so a knee goes inside, and throw a foot, so that we end up with a foot inside, and I'm ready to attack. So this too is a viable position.

(28:58 - 29:07)
The only non-viable position is him two feet inside. This is intolerable. I simply can't keep my leg or can't even start in this position.

(29:07 - 29:15)
So I will avoid this. I will actively seek this. This is pretty good.

(29:16 - 29:32)
This is not bad, but this is intolerable. So a simple drill which we can do to teach these positions goes like this. But now that it hooks into my legs, I practise the skill of turning and pommeling a leg inside.

(29:33 - 29:46)
Now from here, I practise turning and pommeling a leg inside. That's the first pommeling drill. Another one, very useful, is to turn, pommel, and step to the outside position.

(29:47 - 29:51)
Double outside. Both of my legs outside his. Both of his legs outside mine.

(29:52 - 30:00)
Double outside. Double inside, is where I have two legs inside his. The most desirable position.

(30:01 - 30:14)
A shutout is where he has both of his feet inside mine, I have nothing. So I'm completely shut out at this point. I like to seek full practise in going from a shutout to double inside.

(30:15 - 30:29)
Or, from a shutout to single inside. I have one leg inside. And we've seen already that one leg inside can lead into good results if we're smart about how we do it.

(30:30 - 30:37)
Unfortunately, it also means that he can go into my legs at the same time. So it's a little bit neutral. So those critical points.

(30:37 - 30:57)
Shutout, single inside, double inside, are the main ones we work with in this game. We're looking at the general leg lock system. We've seen that it's comprised of six distinct steps and skills.

(30:58 - 31:12)
Mastery of the leg lock system essentially involves mastery of these six steps and skills. The first one that we looked at was the idea of grip and inside positioning. It's time now to switch to our second step in the sequence.

(31:13 - 31:26)
This is the idea of distance and connection. Always remember, there are two elements involved in entering into any Ashigurami, regardless of type. One is inside positioning.

(31:26 - 31:38)
You have to have some form of inside positioning. Whether it be your knee, whether it be your feet, whether it be both legs or one leg, there has to be some element of your legs inside your opponent's legs. Without that, there's no Ashigurami game.

(31:38 - 31:51)
Simple as that. The second is distance. There is a critical demarcation point that you must understand if you are to be an effective user of Ashigurami going into the leg lock game.

(31:51 - 32:06)
This is the concept of the knee line. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of confusion about knees and knee lines. Let's first clearly specify what's the difference and then how we go about using this and understanding it.

(32:06 - 32:22)
Bernardo, sit down, everybody. Let's distinguish between the knee, which you're all very familiar with, just the knee, and the knee line. The knee line is the line that joins one of my knees to the other.

(32:23 - 32:39)
It's a straight line from one knee to the other. Bernardo also has a knee line. My favourite way of dividing the human body out to make the understanding of Jiu-Jitsu easier is to use ankle lines, knee lines, hip lines, shoulder lines, and centre lines.

(32:40 - 33:04)
I use those simple demarcation points to illustrate where I want to be on the human body at any given moment in a match. So I can call to one of my students, centre line control, centre line control, and they know exactly what I'm talking about. In any Ashigurami situation, ultimately what I'm looking to do is to take my opponent's knee and bring it inside my knee line.

(33:06 - 33:20)
Unfortunately, many people don't distinguish between the knee and the knee line. Here, you can clearly see my knee line has not captured Bernardo Faria's knee. His knee is outside my knee line.

(33:21 - 33:35)
As a result, if I attempt any Ashigurami in this situation, I will never control my opponent's leg and hip. When I try to put my foot into a position here, the knee is outside my knee line. There's no control of Bernardo's hip.

(33:35 - 33:58)
It's an anaemic and weak-looking Ashigurami as a result. Bernardo can simply put two hands on the floor, scoot backwards, and he's gone. Whenever we go into an Ashigurami situation, what I need to do is take my knee line and pull his knee within it, or move myself so that I put his knee inside my knee line.

(33:59 - 34:07)
So let's look at a situation where Bernardo moves away from me on his bike. He's walking away. Here, you can clearly see that Bernardo Faria's knee is outside my knee line.

(34:07 - 34:19)
It's obvious to the camera. If I turn my palm up and recline backwards, I can drag his knee back inside my knee line. He walks away from me.

(34:20 - 34:26)
I've lost the knee. It's outside the knee line. I recline backwards, and I bring it right back where it came from.

(34:26 - 34:45)
I'm controlling the distance between myself and Bernardo Faria. Every time he works with distance away from me, I'm looking to draw back inside. This means that when I go to lock an Ashigurami now, I form a bite over my opponent's leg, where my knee line clearly has his knee within it.

(34:46 - 35:08)
When Bernardo goes to walk away from me now, even with no hands, he can walk along the floor. The Ashigurami is locked in such a way that he's simply not going to get away. This concept of distance, of taking my opponent's knee and holding it inside my knee line, is one of the absolute most important elements.

(35:09 - 35:37)
We're looking at it in the context of an unresisting training partner who's just moving in predictable directions. When it comes time for international competition, you're going to have to do this and control that knee within your knee line on extremely powerful athletic opposition, people who are doing everything they can to create distance between the knee line and the knee. Learning how to control that distance is going to be a huge, huge part of our study on this BBD series.

(35:38 - 35:45)
First, we have to understand what is the basic goal. It can be stated very, very simply. I have a knee line.

(35:45 - 35:52)
He has a knee. I want his knee inside my knee line. Clearly, right now, it's outside.

(35:54 - 36:15)
Any kind of movement that draws him towards me and puts his knee inside my knee line is money in the bank for me. When he goes to move away from me now, I have excellent control over my training partner's body, even with no hands. So that's the concept of knee and knee line.

(36:20 - 36:38)
We're looking at the second critical skill of entering into the Ashigurami leg lock game. This is the skill of distance and connection. I have to be able to get a certain measure of distance which enables me to form an effective connection on my opponent's leg and hip.

(36:39 - 36:54)
That measuring distance is my knee line relative to my opponent's knee. I always want my opponent's knee held within my knee line. The second I fail to do that, the entire Ashigurami system will fall apart.

(36:55 - 37:28)
Learning to govern that distance between you and your opponent, between his knee and your knee line, is one of the absolute most important concepts that we work with in this entire DVD series. A huge part of what we do when we get into the nuts and bolts of forming a heel on someone later in the series will be based around that crucial concept. In fact, I would go even further and say that you, as a prospective leg locker, will find that almost 90% of your failures with leg locks can be traced back to that one simple concept.

(37:29 - 37:58)
Can you keep your opponent's knee inside your knee line? That's why we're going to spend so much time on it later in this DVD. Now, whenever I go to coach someone, when they first begin the leg lock game, there's a series of drills which I give to them in their early days which massively help their development in this notion of distance and knee control. These are gravity drills.

(37:58 - 38:24)
Gravity drills are a set of four simple drills which make my athletes work against gravity to connect their body to their opponent's leg. The beauty of gravity drills is that gravity will immediately reveal any weakness in distance and connection. You simply cannot perform a gravity drill without distance and without a strong sense of connection.

(38:26 - 38:51)
Any failures on your part will immediately be revealed by the pull of gravity as you slide down your opponent's leg and fail. Let's have a look at the first and most basic gravity drill. When I say basic, I laugh when I say this because I think it's fair to say my students are among the best leg lockers in the world, but when it's time for international competition, when they're warming up in the changing room, the first thing I make them do is gravity drills.

(38:52 - 39:13)
No matter how good you get in the leg game, I still believe that gravity drills should be a regular part of your training because they reinforce the most essential habits and characteristics of good leg locking of inside position, distance and connection. Let's have a look at the first gravity drill. It's pretty basic.

(39:13 - 39:27)
I'll go with Kong style on this one. The first gravity drill, in my opinion, is the most important and the one I want you focussing on first. This is where we face our opponent and go up into the standard form of Ashigurami.

(39:29 - 39:44)
Because this form of Ashigurami is the one we use most of the time, I believe this is the best drill for you to start on when you first begin your leg lock study. We're going to have an opponent standing over us. He's going to stand in a square stance with his feet fairly wide.

(39:44 - 39:51)
He's going to have his hands away from his hips. I don't care where you put your hands. You can cross your hands like you're in prayer.

(39:51 - 40:06)
You can put your hands behind your back and do whatever you want. But what we don't want is interference from hands at this point for the sake of the drill. When someone stands over me like this, they have an ankle line which runs a line from one ankle to the other.

(40:07 - 40:21)
Let's think about that. Because the ankle line is directly underneath my training partner's knee line, as the demarcation point for distance. If my hips do not go past that ankle line, I will never satisfactorily go into an Ashigurami.

(40:22 - 40:36)
So here, you can clearly see my hips have failed to breach Karl Massaro's ankle line. As a result, when I try to go into the Ashigurami, I simply can't get my leg around his leg. I can't even begin to get into the Ashigurami.

(40:40 - 40:50)
The knees are directly over the ankles. So when someone stands over me, the knee line is manifested by the line of the ankles. My hips must breach that line.

(40:50 - 41:04)
So in the drill, we start off in front of our training partner with a curved spine, like so. I take a double leg position on my training partner. I use a combination of hands and feet to pull my hips past his ankle line.

(41:05 - 41:26)
Once my hips breach the ankle line, it is the easiest thing in the world for me to throw my legs up, and my lower back must rise off the mat. If my lower back does not rise off the mat to connect to my opponent's hip, you will always get a weak and pathetic looking Ashigurami. I must throw my hips off the mat.

(41:27 - 41:41)
The only way I can do that is by curving my spine. When my spine curves, I easily go up into the air, and you can clearly see my knee line has passed his knee. I have successfully locked onto my opponent.

(41:42 - 41:50)
I have no hands. The only thing holding me in place is my leg connection. The Ashigurami is the only thing holding me in place.

(41:50 - 42:17)
The pinch of my knees with my knee line above my opponent's knee makes for a perfect connection. If there were any deficiencies in my Ashigurami, gravity would soon pull me down, and my knees would slip below his knees, and you would have a feeble looking Ashigurami. So what are we learning in this basic drill? The first skill is distance.

(42:18 - 42:36)
If I fail to breach my opponent's ankle line, which, because he's standing, is essentially my opponent's knee line, I will never get to an Ashigurami position on either side. So the first reason you'll fail here, lack of distance. As a result, I simply can't get my leg around my opponent's leg.

(42:38 - 42:51)
So the first requirement is penetration. When I go in on my training partner, it's never enough just to pull with your hands. I must learn to use my feet to penetrate past the ankle line.

(42:51 - 43:03)
So the first skill, penetration. I have clearly gone well past my opponent's ankle line. As a result, it's very easy for me to go on to the next skill, which is a skill of posture.

(43:03 - 43:22)
I must have a rounded spine. If my spine is flat and my head is on the floor, this will always manifest itself as a poor looking Ashigurami, where there's no ability to get my knee past his knee line. I need a rounded spine.

(43:23 - 43:38)
A rounded spine gives me the upward mobility I need to throw and catch. There's my knee line. Kamasara's knee is clearly inside my knee line, which is the essential prerequisite of good Ashigurami control.

(43:40 - 43:59)
I'm working against gravity, but with no hands, it's the easiest thing for me to hold on because the Ashigurami is my sense of connection. It's my means of connection. Even if Kamasara began pushing down on my feet now, there's a good sense of connection here where I can start to off balance people and put them down to the mat.

(44:01 - 44:12)
Now, that's the basic drill. Let's look at how we use this in the gym to develop good habits. Remember, there are three good habits that we want to build out of this outstanding drill.

(44:13 - 44:21)
The first, penetration of the ankle line. The second, posture. I need a rounded spine in order to be effective.

(44:22 - 44:35)
And third, connection so that my opponent's knee is inside my knee line. Those are the three critical skills that this drill teaches. Let's have a look at how we do this in a live drilling situation.

(44:36 - 44:41)
We have a training partner with feet apart. We start. Our first thing is posture.

(44:42 - 44:54)
I have a rounded spine. My spine goes into the same shape as the bottom of a rocking chair. Because my spine is the shape of a rocking chair, I can easily take my lower back off the ground.

(44:54 - 45:10)
Because my lower back can come off the ground, it's easy for me to elevate into an Ashigurami situation. If I have a flat spine, you simply can't come up. So posture begins everything.

(45:10 - 45:21)
A rounded spine enables me to come up off the floor into the Ashigurami. The second element is penetration. You can never penetrate just with the hands.

(45:21 - 45:44)
You can never penetrate just with the feet. It's always the combination of both that puts me deep inside my opponent's ankle line. When I have the combination of rounded posture, my spine the same shape as a rocking chair, and there's depth of penetration, the hips far beyond the ankle line, it's the easiest thing in the world to come up and connect.

(45:45 - 46:03)
We do a repetition drill where we practise coming up side to side and forming a connection. Every time you come up, I recommend you bite into the hips, no hands, and stop. You come up, bite into the hips, no hands, and stop.

(46:03 - 46:25)
Come up, bite into the hips, no hands, and stop. So that we're reinforcing the habit of a rounded spine working inside the ankle line and coming up and forming good connection. Once we form that connection 10, 20, in some cases 100 times, we'll put our training partner down.

(46:26 - 46:50)
I recommend when you do this drill that you work for long numbers of repetitions. Why? Because if you're using your abdominal muscles to bring your body up into this position, you will quickly become exhausted. You can only perform high numbers of repetitions if your spine is doing the work for you.

(46:51 - 47:09)
If your rounded spine makes repetitions efficient. If you ask me, I'm a 51-year-old man with a hip replacement, to do 200 sit-ups, I would probably die. But I can do the Ashi Garami drill all day.

(47:09 - 47:12)
Not because I'm in great shape. I'm not. I'm in terrible shape.

(47:13 - 47:25)
But my spine is rounded. And as a result, I can easily go up and form a connection to an opponent. Bernardo, you're going to do the drill.

(47:25 - 47:32)
I've got to coach you. With power. First, let's talk about the three elements we're trying to coach.

(47:33 - 47:42)
The first is Bernardo's posture. We need a rounded spine. That means the shoulders come forward, the head comes forward, and your spine is the same shape as the bottom of a rocking chair.

(47:43 - 47:55)
This is going to be true for almost all of your Ashi Garami entries from the bottom position. The second thing is penetration. Bernardo's hip line must penetrate Karl's ankle line.

(47:56 - 48:08)
He can only do this by the combined effort of hands and feet together. Beautiful. Now, if Bernardo's spine flattens and he tries to throw his legs, he'll never make a satisfactory connection.

(48:09 - 48:18)
So his first thing is to bring knees to chest and chin to chest. With knees and chin to chest, he throws the Ashi Garami and catches. Good.

(48:18 - 48:25)
Here's Bernardo's knee line. Here's Kawasara's knee. He has clearly made a satisfactory connection.

(48:26 - 48:33)
Okay? Now he's going to go for repetitions, side to side. Beautiful. Beautiful.

(48:45 - 49:23)
And now, he'll put him down to the floor. It's no exaggeration that if I were coaching someone who had no experience of leg locks whatsoever and I had only 24 hours to make them at least partially competent in leg locking, I would spend probably the first 12 hours of those 24 making them do this simple drill because it teaches and encapsulates all the critical elements of bottom position Ashi Garami. The rounded spine, which makes the rocking chair motion possible and enables you to move a heavy resisting opponent on top of you.

(49:24 - 49:49)
Penetration, of getting your centre of gravity underneath your opponent's centre of gravity, penetrating through underneath and getting to a position where you can elevate people and get them up into your Ashi Garami game. And then the critical concept of connection. The critical concept of distance where my opponent's knee is captured within my knee line and a satisfactory connection is made, which in this case is tested by gravity.

(49:49 - 49:59)
If you don't make a satisfactory connection you will simply slide down your opponent's leg. There's no way to fake that. Gravity will reveal your Ashi Garami as weak and ineffective immediately.

(49:59 - 50:10)
The only way you can pass this test is either a conclusive pass or a conclusive fail. Gravity will make it that way. That's our first of four gravity drills.

(50:14 - 50:50)
We've been looking at the so-called gravity drills, which are my favourite way to take a beginning student who wants to immerse themselves in Ashi Garami and leg locking and create in them this ability to form a satisfactory sense of distance and connection to their opponent. The beauty of gravity drills is that the force of gravity will reveal any deficiencies in your connection to your opponent's legs. Ultimately what I'm trying to do is coach you to a position where your legs can form a 100% successful connection to your opponent's leg without the use of the hands.

(50:53 - 51:09)
In the case of gravity drills, gravity itself will reveal any sense of deficiency in your connection to your opponent's hips and leg. We just looked at our first gravity drill where we faced our opponent. Now we're going to do the same drill facing in the opposite direction.

(51:10 - 51:22)
Tantra Sara is going to be standing over us and this time we're going to start facing away from our opponent instead of into him. Once again, posture begins everything. You must begin with a rounded spine.

(51:23 - 51:38)
I'm going to say this again because it's so important. If I have a flattened spine and I try to play the Ashi Garami game from the bottom you will never succeed. I must make my body my spine in particular the same shape as a rocking chair.

(51:38 - 51:55)
Think about the remarkable properties of a rocking chair. You can take a 400 pound man put him in a rocking chair and with just the action of his toes he can move his body weight back and forth. Isn't that a remarkable thing? 400 pounds moving effortlessly through the actions of one foot.

(51:56 - 52:15)
That's how efficient that rounded rocking chair shape is. And you can use exactly the same mechanical principle to work underneath your opponents and elevate them into the leg locking game. From a situation where I start off with my rounded spine I recline backwards with my knees to my chest and I get a hold of my opponent's legs.

(52:16 - 52:31)
Double leg situation just like we did previously. This time as I come up on my training partner I practise the idea of the rounded spine that starts everything. Then we take one leg and split it from the other leg.

(52:31 - 52:43)
So I have a leg inside and a leg outside. The inside leg I connect my shoelaces to my opponent's hamstring. How you connect is extremely important.

(52:44 - 53:03)
If I simply connect without changing the orientation of my body I make a poor connection. But when I connect the whole shoelace to my opponent's hamstring now we have an excellent connection. Now I bring my second leg around my opponent's body and I form a wedge behind my opponent's knee.

(53:03 - 53:23)
So I'm connected with no hands to my opponent's legs and hips. This is a strong sense of connection which even as gravity pulls down on me, gravity is not pulling my body down to the floor because I have an excellent connection to my opponent's hips through my legs alone. No hands involved.

(53:23 - 53:41)
Now I put my foot back on my opponent's hip and I go back to the starting position. I come up I put my shoelace on my training partner's opposite hamstring I go around and lock. So again, I have a wedge behind the knees.

(53:42 - 54:13)
Again, I'm being held off the floor only by my legs. Kawasara's knee is clearly inside my knee line. In this way, you can clearly see the knee is inside my knee line.

(54:13 - 54:28)
Without the use of any hands, I'm staying hooked up to my opponent's hip despite the effects of gravity. From here, it's the easiest thing in the world to draw legs in and knock my opponent down to the mat. Let's give it a try.

(54:29 - 55:37)
The second gravity drill. We've been looking at a collection of drills which is designed to take the incoming student and quickly make their body move in the correct ways to be effective in the body position. We've seen the critical idea is that of a rounded rocking chair shaped spine which enables our body to carry a large amount of weight and move it effectively in and out of balance so we can get underneath our opponent and enter into the legs.

We've seen the idea of distance. We have to be able to pull our body sufficiently close to our opponent's body that our knees our knee line can capture our opponent's knee. If we can do these things, you can be extremely effective in the leglock game.

We use gravity as a means of testing whether or not we're doing these things satisfactorily. Gravity will quickly reveal any deficiencies in what you're doing and make it obvious to anyone watching. Let's look now at the third gravity drill which I often have my students do.

(55:38 - 55:49)
It involves a rolling inversion. Essentially, it's half of a move popularly known as an Imanari roll. It's essentially an Imanari roll done from the floor.

(55:50 - 56:04)
We're going to have an opponent standing over us. Feet apart. We're going to start with our rocking chair shaped spine and then from here we're going to turn off angle so we're at 45 degrees to our training partner.

(56:04 - 57:13)
We don't want to be square one in this case. From the 45 degree angle, I'm going to take my nearside hand and I'm going to put it wrist deep inside my training partner's knee, just like so. So there's the wrist deep entry.

45 degrees wrist deep entry. From the wrist deep entry, I'm going to use that to pull my body around the corner and get a 2 on 1 grip on my training partner's leg. Once again, I start off first with posture.

I go to 45 degrees and then I put my hand wrist deep inside my training partner's leg. The wrist deep combined with my posture means that I can easily pull my body around and establish a 2 on 1 grip. From the 2 on 1 grip, I invert.

I put my shoelaces behind my training partner's hamstring and I form a satisfactory connection to my opponent's leg. Let's be sure that we understand what my legs are doing. I have a push leg and a pull leg.

My two legs go in two contrary directions. My right leg pushes into the thigh and my left leg pulls into my chest. That scissoring action around my opponent's leg is what holds me off the floor against the effects of gravity.

(57:14 - 57:34)
I have no hands. There's simply a pushing leg and a pulling leg. One is a wedge behind the knee and the other is a wedge in front of the hip.

So both sides of my opponent's leg, front and back, have a wedge put around them. And that wedge is what's holding me in place. Then from here, the bottom knee points at the top knee.

(57:35 - 57:53)
That puts my opponent down into a controlled position where we can work on the floor. So let's have a look again at the rolling inversion, or half ominari, as a drill to test our sense of connection and distance. We start as always with a rounded spine.

(57:54 - 58:20)
Now we get an angle and a wispy entry on my training partner's knee. This enables me to turn two on one knees to chest, shoelace connection, and then the critical notion of a push leg and a pull leg. Because my legs are scissoring in two opposite directions, one pushing, one pulling, the effect of gravity is negated.

(58:20 - 58:46)
And I can keep my knee, sorry, my opponent's knee, inside my knee line. If I was not pushing with this leg and not pulling with this leg, gravity would quickly manifest itself and I would slide down the leg and lose control of the knee. The whole purpose of gravity drills is to quickly reveal whether or not you're forming a satisfactory connection through the use of a push leg and a pull leg with your ashi garami.

(58:47 - 59:21)
Let's have a look one more time at this half ominari, or rolling inversion gravity drill. We have a rounded spine, we have an angle, I have wispy entry. The wispy entry enables me to turn to the two-on-one.

I bring my knees to my chest so I have that rolling chair-shaped spine which makes it so easy to come up off the floor. I come in, shoelaces behind, and lock. I have a push leg and a pull leg.

(59:22 - 59:35)
That creates a wedge behind the knee and a wedge in front of the knee. You can clearly see my knee line and his knee is inside of it. Now, I take the bottom knee and point it at the top knee.

(59:37 - 1:00:04)
As a result, we get a quick entry down to the mat. We've been looking at the use of so-called gravity drills to build the attributes necessary for successful leg lock applications, mostly from the bottom position. Really what we're looking to do is to cement the idea of distance and connection, the second critical skill of Ashigarami-based leg locks.

(1:00:05 - 1:00:32)
We've seen without a satisfactory connection which puts my opponent's knee inside my knee line, we're never going to be going into any form of successful leg lock activity in live training. The beauty of gravity drills is that they provide an acid test for whether or not you're forming a satisfactory connection to your opponent's legs. Any deficiencies in my connection will immediately be revealed by the force of gravity.

(1:00:33 - 1:01:08)
Let's look at our fourth gravity drill designed to create those good habits of posture, of rising off the floor and forming a satisfactory connection to our opponent's leg through the use of our legs. We've seen that one of the keynote elements of successful applications of Ashigarami from bottom is the idea of a rounded spine, the shape of a banana or the bottom of a rocking chair. Just as a rocking chair can support a huge amount of weight and then move it with a minimum amount of effort, so too your spine can do the same thing when you're working from bottom position.

(1:01:09 - 1:01:33)
The second key element is the idea of my Ashigarami itself. We've seen that every Ashigarami has a scissoring action. Most people identify Ashigarami as a squeezing action of the legs.

This is inadequate. You have to scissor the legs to manifest real strength in your control of your opponent's leg. You're going to have a pushing leg and a pull leg.

(1:01:35 - 1:01:51)
This is trained in a fourth way like so. I'm going to come up to my opponent's ankle line, my shoulder and hold at the shin just below the knee. We're going to start from that posture of a rounded spine.

(1:01:52 - 1:02:03)
The idea of bringing our body up off the floor so that our lower back comes up off the mat. From here, I'm going to split my legs. I'm going to come around my opponent's leg.

(1:02:04 - 1:02:21)
We know that we have a push leg and a pull leg. As I come around with one leg, I go in front with the other and I form an initial connection behind my opponent that will put him down. This time Karl will stand in a slightly stronger stance.

(1:02:28 - 1:02:36)
From here, we bring our body up. We bring a leg behind and a leg in front. Our legs are starting to split.

(1:02:37 - 1:03:15)
From here, one leg goes in front ultimately that will be my push leg. The other leg will go behind ultimately that will be my pull leg. As I go around behind my opponent, I make an initial catch right in here.

My shoelace hooks behind his hamstring and the second hooks behind his knee. You can clearly see there's my knee line. His knee is within my knee line.

Now, as always, my bottom knee points at the top knee and will put our opponent down into a controlling position. One more time. The fourth gravity drill facing this way Karl.

(1:03:18 - 1:03:34)
We bring our body up. You can see that my spine is rounded. As a result, I can start the action of splitting my legs.

As my legs split, I rise off the floor. My back is coming up. The legs continue to split.

(1:03:35 - 1:03:57)
We catch one, catch two and my legs, without the use of my hands, hold me in place. One leg is pushing forwards. The other is pulling back towards me.

Now the bottom knee points towards the top knee and we end up in a nice cross-axial position.


## Volume 3

(0:03 - 0:23)
We're looking at the idea of distance and connection. We've seen that the measure of distance is the relationship between my opponent's knee and my knee line. I know that I'm satisfactorily connecting and managing distance when I can retain my opponent's knee inside my knee line.

(0:24 - 0:37)
That will require skills of penetration. I have to be able to get up to my opponent's hips and secure his knee within my knee line. And it also requires an understanding of Ashigurami itself.

(0:37 - 0:49)
We've identified a push leg and a pull leg. We've also seen four practical drills which enable us to test the efficacy of that connection. Is it working or not? Gravity will immediately show if it's not.

(0:50 - 1:15)
It would be remiss on my part to go any further with regards to concept of connection without introducing the first and arguably the most important form of Ashigurami that is the basis of the entire Ashigurami system that I teach. This is what most people think of when they think of Ashigurami. That's why it's often referred to as a standard Ashigurami.

(1:16 - 1:35)
The phrase I use for it is Arimi Ashigurami. Arimi simply means to enter or to go into. I use this Ashigurami primarily as a means of entering into my opponent's legs and forming an initial connection from which all the other elements of the leg lock system will kick in.

(1:36 - 1:53)
Let's have a look at what Arimi Ashigurami is. If Bernardo is seated like so. Arimi Ashigurami refers to a situation where I have my opponent's knee inside my knee line.

(1:53 - 2:08)
I have an inside leg and an outside leg. My outside leg is primarily used to govern distance. I point my toes to the outside and my foot hooks here on top of my opponent's hip.

(2:09 - 2:23)
If Bernardo leans forward, he will go into the resistance of the sole of my foot. So it helps in distance management. However, do not push and extend into your opponent's ribcage.

(2:23 - 2:35)
That is not the idea. You are actually pushing him out of the Ashigurami. In fact, what I do is I engage in a movement we call backheeling.

(2:35 - 2:46)
A backheel is where I take my heel back towards my own buttocks and hamstrings. So my foot backheels. It pulls on my training partner's quadriceps.

(2:46 - 2:59)
Just like so. Now, a very important point comes out with my second foot. Let's refer to the top of my foot as the shoelaces of the foot.

(3:00 - 3:12)
Where the shoelaces are when you put on a pair of shoes. I have two choices now where I go to place the shoelaces of my second foot. I can place my shoelaces in a so-called cross-buttock position.

(3:13 - 3:20)
Where my left shoelaces go to my opponent's left buttocks. Because it goes across the centerline. It's a cross-buttock position.

(3:21 - 3:32)
That gives me a certain kind of control over my opponent. It will be very important for some of the moves we look at later today. I have a straight buttock position.

(3:32 - 3:42)
Where my left foot goes to my opponent's right buttock. There are pros and cons to each. There are times we use one and not the other.

(3:43 - 3:51)
When I've actually secured the Urimi-Ashi-Gurami position. And my opponent's hips are on the floor. I like to go with a straight buttock shoelace position.

(3:52 - 4:03)
This means that I can close my knee over my ankle. And form a complete circle around Bernardo's legs and hip. If I go into a cross-buttock position.

(4:03 - 4:11)
There is an open space between my knee and my ankle. Which Bernardo can exploit by pushing my foot down. And breaking the strength of my Ashi-Gurami hold.

(4:13 - 4:26)
So I like to close and reinforce the two wedges around my opponent's leg. You must think of your two legs as wedges around your opponent's hips. I like to reinforce wedges whenever possible.

(4:26 - 4:36)
Now, when I close, the wedges touch each other. And form a complete circle around the leg. When I go cross-buttock, it is an open wedge.

(4:36 - 4:43)
Which Bernardo can easily exploit. And start to break the integrity of my Ashi-Gurami. So once we move in on our opponent.

(4:43 - 4:48)
This is our basic starting position. We lock in. We close knee and ankle together.

(4:48 - 4:57)
And I put body weight over his shin. This forms an excellent connection to my opponent. We can test that connection through a series of simple drills.

(4:58 - 5:07)
Bernardo is going to put two hands on the floor. He is going to walk backwards on his hands and buttocks. And with no hands.

(5:08 - 5:23)
You will see that the integrity of my Ashi-Gurami is retained. I kept his knee inside my knee line. So that is an excellent test.

The dragging test. Where your training partner will try to drag you along the mat. And you will keep the Ashi-Gurami with no hands.

(5:24 - 5:39)
The second test is a rolling test. Where we start off with an Arimi Ashi-Gurami in place. Bernardo is going to turn and roll in this direction.

(5:39 - 5:51)
With no hands, he rolls. And rolls. And you can clearly see that I retain his knee inside my knee line.

(5:52 - 6:04)
Despite not using my hands at all. I was learning to trust in my legs. By employing a strong back heel with my legs.

(6:04 - 6:12)
And pulling with the Ashi-Gurami instead of pushing. I was able to keep my opponent to me without even using my hands. Because my hands are free.

(6:13 - 6:19)
That means, as we will see later today. I can start going into walks with my hands. While my legs take care of the lower body.

(6:19 - 6:27)
As my legs control his knee and hip. My hands should be occupied with going to the ankle. To perform the actual walk.

(6:28 - 6:37)
Let's have a look at this again. We've identified an Arimi Ashi-Gurami. We've seen I have two choices with my inside foot.

(6:38 - 6:47)
I can go straight buttock or cross buttock. Many of the moves we'll be looking at later today will involve a cross buttock position. But when it's time to just form a solid connection.

(6:47 - 6:57)
I generally prefer a straight buttock placement. We like the idea of closing knee and ankle together. Then I put body weight over my opponent's shin.

(6:58 - 7:04)
And now we've got a strong sense of connection. When my opponent goes to walk. Going backwards.

(7:06 - 7:11)
Even with no hands. We lock to them. When he goes to roll.

(7:14 - 7:30)
Even with no hands we're connected. And controlling the knee inside the knee line. We've been saying when it comes to forming an initial connection to your opponent's legs.

(7:30 - 7:43)
There is one Ashi-Gurami that stands out above all the others. And in my opinion is the one you should devote most of your early training time to developing. This is the standard or as I call it Arimi Ashi-Gurami.

(7:44 - 7:59)
This is the primary means by which we enter into our opponent's legs. Arimi just means to enter. Arimi Ashi-Gurami is the absolute undisputed king of forming an initial entry and connection into your opponent's legs.

(7:59 - 8:11)
And it should be a very very important part of your study. We've just seen how we can form a strong connection to the legs. We've seen some basic gravity drills which show how we can enter in.

(8:12 - 8:30)
Let's look now at some common sense ways in which we form an initial entry into our opponent's legs with Arimi Ashi-Gurami. We'll be spending a lot of time on this as we get into applications of the leg lock system later on in the DVD. But it's important you should just have an initial sense of what the hell you're trying to do when you first enter into your opponent's legs.

(8:30 - 8:42)
If I have an other thari on two knees and under me. And we have some kind of working grip on our training partner. So for example if I had a collar and elbow on my training partner.

(8:42 - 8:50)
We've seen that when we work the collar and elbow position. We like to take a high tricep grip. That puts my wrist underneath Panato's elbow.

(8:50 - 8:55)
So when he tries to get down to my legs. It's difficult on that side of the body. So we have an excellent collar time.

(8:55 - 9:01)
When we hit the collar time. We never hit superficial collar time with the fingers. We always go wrist deep.

(9:01 - 9:07)
And we always connect his forehead to our shoulder. So often I see people hitting collar time. There's no real connection here.

(9:07 - 9:11)
He can easily drive in on you. He can easily put a hand inside my bicep. And clear it away.

(9:15 - 9:24)
So what I want to do is connect Panato's forehead to my shoulder. Then I want to take my high tricep grip on my training partner. When Panato goes to pull away from me.

(9:25 - 9:34)
It's shockingly difficult. And as a result it's very easy for us to get his hands onto the floor. Once we start elevating people in this position.

(9:34 - 9:42)
There's a common set of problems. The most common problem that I see is that people don't do a good job. Of getting their opponent's hips over their head.

(9:44 - 9:52)
Right now if Panato crossed his feet. It would be quite difficult for me to get into his legs. However if I switch from my initial pulling grip.

(9:52 - 9:57)
To a pushing grip. And I bring Panato's hips over my head. Even when he crosses his feet.

(9:58 - 10:02)
It's extremely easy for me. To come down. Get an angle on my training partner.

(10:03 - 10:12)
And enter into the Ashi Garami. In this case it's in a Rimi Ashi Garami. I'll just demonstrate on this.

(10:14 - 10:19)
So. As we go to grapple with our training partner. We've seen first we need to form a strong.

(10:19 - 10:26)
Satisfactory sense of connection through grip. When we collar tight with our training partner. My fingers should come all the way through.

(10:27 - 10:31)
To the far side. If they fail to do so. It's so easy for Panato to take an inside position.

(10:32 - 10:35)
Or get his head inside etc. So I want to come in. Lock.

(10:35 - 10:39)
And my elbow drops. So when he goes to pommel in. It's a difficult thing.

(10:40 - 10:43)
When he goes to drive forward. He runs into the forearm. Now.

(10:43 - 10:48)
I want my forehead close to his. So our heads are connected. Ok.

(10:48 - 10:52)
I don't want him gripping my legs. So we take that tricep grip. And pull in.

(10:53 - 10:57)
When Panato goes to yank away from me. It's very very difficult. And it's relatively easy now.

(10:57 - 11:01)
To get his hands to the mat. Ok. Now.

(11:01 - 11:05)
Right now his hips are over my hips. That's ok. On most people.

(11:05 - 11:10)
I could probably get into an Ashi Garami. In this situation. But Panato Faria.

(11:10 - 11:13)
Has his ankles locked. And as a result. It's quite difficult for me.

(11:13 - 11:17)
To kick into an Ashi Garami. So now. I go the extra distance.

(11:17 - 11:21)
And take the hips. Directly over our head. This is a very important concept.

(11:21 - 11:25)
That we'll be spending a lot of time on. As this DVD goes further and further. Ok.

(11:26 - 11:30)
Head over hips. To enter into the legs from bottom. Once I start pushing.

(11:31 - 11:36)
And his hips come directly over my head. No amount of crossing his legs on his part. Is going to stop me.

(11:36 - 11:42)
From forming an angle. 90 degrees to my training partner's hips. So now I have angle.

(11:42 - 11:47)
His head is out to the side. And now we're in excellent position. Because of our perpendicular angle.

(11:47 - 11:52)
A good connection that puts his knee. Inside our knee line. We've got a nice.

(11:54 - 11:59)
Bite of ankle and knee together. Good control of the feet. When Panato tries to turn and face me.

(11:59 - 12:04)
It's quite a difficult thing. Because of my knee position. And I can easily make him turn in this direction.

(12:04 - 12:07)
For one kind of heel hook. Or. If he comes back in this direction here.

(12:08 - 12:12)
I can easily. Place my second foot through. Start elevating.

(12:12 - 12:16)
Going around the corner. And pulling him into. The second form heel hook here.

(12:17 - 12:22)
And it all starts. With that initial. Arimi Ashi Garami entry.

(12:23 - 12:27)
You are going to find. That there are an almost limitless number of ways. In which we can enter into.

(12:28 - 12:31)
Arimi Ashi Garami. From a wealth of different positions. So for example.

(12:31 - 12:36)
Panato is on two knees. And like many players. He posts a leg.

(12:36 - 12:40)
And puts a leg up. From here it's so easy for us now. To take a variety of grips.

(12:40 - 12:46)
Get a knee inside our training partner. And go into an Arimi Ashi Garami. Always the emphasis is the same.

(12:46 - 12:51)
I want to close. Knee and ankle. So that I have a closed circle.

(12:51 - 12:55)
Around my opponent's knee and hip. I want my knees. Pulling back to me.

(12:55 - 12:59)
When I push on my opponent. I'm actually pushing his knee. Out of my knee line.

(12:59 - 13:03)
That's not what I want. I want everything. Pulling inwards.

(13:04 - 13:07)
Towards me. Okay. I want destabilisation.

(13:07 - 13:13)
I want to control the position of his head. We'll be coming back to that very important theme later today. But the main thing is.

(13:13 - 13:17)
We've got to secure. Arimi Ashi Garami. From where we have an initial connection.

(13:18 - 13:23)
That will determine the outcome. We gain from this position. It's also true when my opponent is standing over me.

(13:25 - 13:29)
From here. Once we establish inside position. It's not a difficult thing.

(13:29 - 13:32)
To go into an Arimi Ashi Garami. So many ways to do it. From here.

(13:33 - 13:37)
Very often. I will start by getting an opponent's hand to the floor. I put my hand on the mat.

(13:37 - 13:41)
Pull. And get his hands down to the mat. And as a result.

(13:41 - 13:44)
He can quickly come up. And close the circle. Around hip and knee.

(13:45 - 13:47)
And once again. We've secured a nice. Arimi Ashi Garami.

(13:48 - 13:51)
That puts a deep bite. On my opponent's leg. And ensures that his knee.

(13:52 - 13:55)
Is well inside my knee line. And as a result. From here.

(13:55 - 14:08)
We can put an opponent. Under tremendous pressure. Now.

(14:08 - 14:13)
Let's begin our study. Of the third critical skill. Of heel hooking.

(14:14 - 14:21)
Out of Ashi Garami. The third critical skill. Or the third step.

(14:21 - 14:27)
In the general leg lock system. Is. It's a contingent step.

(14:27 - 14:31)
It's only necessary. When we work from bottom position. Okay.

(14:31 - 14:35)
So if you're working leg locks from top position. You would simply skip this entire step. However.

(14:36 - 14:40)
Given that the majority. Of entries into leg locks. Which I favour.

(14:40 - 14:45)
Are typically from bottom position. It's very important for you to know this. This is the skill.

(14:45 - 14:49)
Of breaking an opponent. Down to a hip. Okay.

(14:49 - 14:53)
Whenever we have an Ashi Garami. It's very important. That we focus primarily.

(14:54 - 14:58)
Upon breaking our opponents. Down to the floor. It is possible.

(14:58 - 15:02)
To break someone's leg. When they're standing over you. However.

(15:03 - 15:09)
It is not a high percentage way. To approach the leg locking game. It's very much to your advantage.

(15:09 - 15:13)
To break your opponent. Down to a hip. Or at the very least.

(15:13 - 15:16)
Down to a knee. Okay. Only then.

(15:16 - 15:18)
Can you really get. Genuine. Controlled.

(15:18 - 15:21)
Breaking power. On your opponent's legs. Yes.

(15:21 - 15:24)
You can occasionally. Break someone's leg. When they're standing over you.

(15:24 - 15:27)
It can be done. But I'm not interested. In what can be done.

(15:28 - 15:31)
I'm interested. In what can be done. Most of the time.

(15:31 - 15:36)
On very high level opponents. That's the interesting question. And so in these situations.

(15:36 - 15:39)
Whenever you get a chance. Break your opponent. Down to a hip.

(15:39 - 15:43)
It's much easier. To get into strong. Breaking mechanics.

(15:43 - 15:47)
When your opponent is. Controlled on the floor. And when they're standing above you.

(15:47 - 15:51)
In a rather chaotic situation. Okay. Let's look first.

(15:51 - 15:53)
At a situation. Where I have an. Arimiyoshi Gurami.

(15:53 - 15:56)
On my opponent. And let's look at. What can go wrong.

(15:57 - 16:05)
When he's not. Broken down to a hip. You will remember.

(16:05 - 16:07)
We went over. A bunch of gravity drills. And we used.

(16:07 - 16:09)
Quite a lot. of gravity. As a test.

(16:09 - 16:12)
Of whether or not. We could hold. Our opponent's knee.

(16:13 - 16:16)
Within our knee line. The Bonato fighter. Is standing over me.

(16:17 - 16:22)
And I go into. A form of Ashigurami. Here.

(16:22 - 16:25)
I've chosen. Arimiyoshi Gurami. A big part.

(16:26 - 16:29)
Of Bonato's game. Is going to be to take. My knee line.

(16:30 - 16:34)
Below his knee. If he can start. To break the integrity.

(16:34 - 16:37)
Of my Ashigurami. And push my knees down. He will crush.

(16:37 - 16:41)
My Ashigurami attempt. In this position. Because he's pushed.

(16:41 - 16:44)
My knee line. Below his knee. As a result.

(16:45 - 16:47)
I'm simply. Going to be ineffective. In this situation.

(16:47 - 16:51)
Okay. In addition. When I go here.

(16:52 - 16:54)
It's very difficult. For me. To start exposing.

(16:54 - 16:57)
My opponent's heel. Because my opponent's. Body weight.

(16:57 - 16:59)
Is focused. Over the leg. That I'm attacking.

(17:00 - 17:03)
If Bonato points. His knee outwards. And puts his head.

(17:03 - 17:06)
Over his heel. It's very very difficult. For me to expose.

(17:06 - 17:08)
The heel. And get into. A winning position.

(17:10 - 17:13)
So my whole thing. In these situations. Is to begin.

(17:14 - 17:16)
By first. Putting Bonato's. Hips.

(17:16 - 17:24)
Down on the floor. The question is. How are we going to do this? Well.

(17:24 - 17:28)
I'm going to show you. How most people do it. And some problems.

(17:28 - 17:32)
Associated with it. And a slight modification. That makes a real difference.

(17:32 - 17:37)
In a competitive situation. You will often hear. People.

(17:37 - 17:40)
Refer to. The position. We.

(17:40 - 17:43)
We work. As a single leg. X guard.

(17:43 - 17:46)
Okay. And the way most people. Perform the move.

(17:46 - 17:48)
It is. A single leg. X guard.

(17:48 - 17:53)
Okay. They take their foot. To a cross buttock.

(17:53 - 17:56)
Position. Like so. My right foot.

(17:56 - 17:59)
To Bonato's. Right buttock. When I come up.

(17:59 - 18:02)
Into the ashi garami. This creates. Some potential problems.

(18:03 - 18:05)
Because. My knee. Is separated from the ankle.

(18:06 - 18:08)
It's extremely easy. For Bonato. To pull the knee one way.

(18:09 - 18:12)
Push the ankle the other. And break the integrity. Of my ashi garami.

(18:12 - 18:15)
Okay. So what I want to do. In these situations.

(18:16 - 18:21)
Is knock my opponent over. To put his hips on the ground. And that's where the problems start.

(18:21 - 18:25)
If Bonato is smart. He knows. In order to put him down.

(18:25 - 18:29)
I need to point his knee. Out in this direction. So he's going to point his knee.

(18:29 - 18:31)
This way. And he's going to bring his head down. Towards my hand.

(18:33 - 18:35)
Now. When I go to knock him over. He's just going to take.

(18:35 - 18:37)
A series of steps. Backwards. And you'll see.

(18:37 - 18:42)
I will never knock Bonato Faria over. I can try as I might. When I apply pressure.

(18:42 - 18:47)
He will simply walk with me. And he will not go down. Why isn't he going down? Come back Bonato.

(18:48 - 18:51)
He's not going down. Because he has a good posture. His head.

(18:51 - 18:55)
Is centred. Right on his centre line. If Bonato's head.

(18:55 - 19:00)
Moved this way. I could put him down easily. But when he puts his head.

(19:00 - 19:03)
On the centre line. Like so. Lowers his level.

(19:04 - 19:07)
And takes back steps. With his foot. He can accommodate.

(19:07 - 19:09)
the pressure. That I exert. Into his hip.

(19:09 - 19:12)
And try as I might. I can knock. Put him down.

(19:13 - 19:17)
I have to stop. That hopping action. I can't prevent.

(19:17 - 19:20)
Bonato. From bringing his head down. It's simply.

(19:20 - 19:21)
Out of my reach. I can't stop that. It's not up to me.

(19:22 - 19:24)
It's up to him. But I can. Interfere.

(19:24 - 19:26)
With his ability. To take a step. But I need.

(19:26 - 19:30)
A new approach. To the Ashigurami. Instead of going.

(19:30 - 19:32)
Cross buttock. I go straight buttock. Here.

(19:33 - 19:37)
On my opponent's opposite. Buttock. And I connect.

(19:37 - 19:39)
My knee and elbow together. Sorry. My ankle.

(19:39 - 19:43)
And knee together. Now. When I apply the pressure.

(19:43 - 19:45)
Look what happens. When Bonato. Goes to step.

(19:45 - 19:49)
He can step. But he's being. Interfered with.

(19:49 - 19:52)
By my right foot. So what happens is. You establish.

(19:52 - 19:55)
A short. Series of steps. One.

(19:55 - 19:56)
Two. Three. And then he will fall.

(19:57 - 20:00)
So I bring my hips up. I turn my knees. Out.

(20:01 - 20:03)
And then watch. Bonato take. A few steps.

(20:05 - 20:11)
And then drop. Why? Because I'm interfering. With his ability to backstep.

(20:11 - 20:17)
With his free leg. The Ashigurami we're using. Controls both of my opponent's legs.

(20:17 - 20:21)
Through the hips. Instead of just one. If I only control one leg.

(20:21 - 20:26)
My opponent can use the second leg. To defend his basic support. And stay standing.

(20:26 - 20:30)
Let's have a look at this again. We're going to do it. Bonato's back to the camera.

(20:30 - 20:38)
So you can see my foot position. Here. If I have what most people think.

(20:38 - 20:43)
Is a basic Ashigurami. With my foot. In the cross-butt position.

(20:44 - 20:46)
Bonato is free. To hop. With this foot.

(20:47 - 20:51)
There's nothing touching. Bonato's left leg. So when I go to apply pressure.

(20:51 - 20:55)
He can easily hop. By bringing the head down. He can avoid being knocked over.

(20:56 - 21:03)
When I put my foot. In the straight butt position. Things change.

(21:03 - 21:13)
Now he can bring his head down, keep all the good posture he wants. My right foot will begin to interfere with his back step. It's not going to happen on the first step.

(21:13 - 21:18)
It's going to happen on the second, third or fourth. Try to hold your pace. Lock in.

(21:21 - 21:32)
And he drops. This subtle shift in foot placement makes a dramatic difference when it's time to break your opponent down to a hip. Let's have a look at it one more time.

(21:33 - 21:45)
We have an opponent standing over us. We've established inside foot position and as a result we can fire up into an ashi garami. We take our foot and hook it in the straight buttock position, just like so.

(21:46 - 21:57)
My knee and ankle touch. When I apply my force, the first force is up. As he tries to bring the head down, I switch direction, force goes out.

(21:57 - 22:22)
Bernardo tries to walk and is interfered with by the tripping effect of my right foot. And down he goes to the mat. If Bernardo locks up a conventional ashi garami and places his foot in a conventional position here, as it's normally coached.

(22:22 - 22:34)
Kao, go into a defensive position. When Bernardo tries to take him down, Kao makes it difficult to head position and backstep him. He goes in, put him down Bernardo, and it's difficult.

(22:34 - 22:50)
As a result, Kao can eventually fight the ashi garami off and recover. Now let's contrast this with Bernardo Faria interfering with the second leg, right where the buttocks meet the hamstring. Now, from here your knee will touch your own ankle.

(22:52 - 23:14)
And now we put him down. This kind of interference is the basis of breaking someone down to a hip from the erimi ashi garami position. We're looking at the third critical skill, or the third step of the general leg lock system.

(23:14 - 23:24)
This is the skill of breaking an opponent down to a hip. You should note that this skill only occurs in situations where you're working underneath people. If you're on top of them, obviously, skip this step.

(23:25 - 23:41)
But if I'm underneath someone, and I've attached an ashi garami to my opponent's leg, it's very much in my best interest to break them down to a hip, where the submissions come much, much easier. At the very least, I should be looking to break them down to a knee. What I don't want is to try and break people's legs as they stand over me.

(23:41 - 23:52)
That's a difficult thing to do at world championship level. Yes, you can tap some people out with it, usually because they're perhaps a little naive in the leg lock game. But I'm not interested in you tapping naive people out.

(23:52 - 24:03)
I'm interested in you tapping highly competent, strongly resisting opponents. That's when things become interesting. We just looked at the first method of breaking someone down from an erimi ashi garami.

(24:04 - 24:22)
This was the single leg situation. We saw that by putting our foot across to the opposite buttock, you can trip your opponent down over time, put their hips on the floor, and go into a breaking position. Let's look now at the second, and in my opinion, the single best method of breaking an opponent down to a hip from an erimi ashi garami.

(24:23 - 24:41)
This is the double leg method. Whenever you practise takedowns, you've probably noticed that if you get a hold of a single leg takedown, it's very difficult to finish on a skilled wrestler. They can do incredible gymnastics on their other leg to prevent being put down to the floor.

(24:42 - 25:04)
But if you get a good grip on both of your opponent's legs, no matter how gymnastically talented they are, it's a lot, lot easier to dump them onto their butt. It's always in your best interest to get a hold of both of your opponent's legs to put them down in resistance and get their hips to the mat whenever you can. Let's look at some simple strategies to do this.

(25:05 - 25:25)
From a situation where I have an erimi ashi garami on my training partner, he's standing over me. We're fine, our legs up, we've got him to the erimi ashi garami position and locked up. The number one form of resistance we get in these situations is people putting a hand on the knee and a hand on the ankle, bringing the hand down and splitting the ashi garami.

(25:25 - 25:35)
We see this almost every day we attempt to work the move. It's a smart move on Bernardo's part. It breaks my ashi garami apart and it means that I no longer control the knee within my knee line.

(25:36 - 25:44)
Whenever I see this kind of thing going on, I can see what's happening. He's trying to take the knee off and the ankle off. When I see this, I go to a different foot position.

(25:45 - 25:52)
I go to the cross buttock position. My right foot goes to Bernardo's right buttock. My left foot goes on the mat.

(25:52 - 26:06)
I retain the grip on the ankle. What I want to do is put Bernardo's hands on the floor. I use the cross buttock position combined with a push off the floor of my left foot to bring his hands to the mat.

(26:07 - 26:29)
That also brings his second foot into gripping range. As a result, I can fire my legs up into an ashi garami so that as Bernardo goes to recover his costume, it's the easiest thing in the world to put him down. But this time, my opponent can't do the one thing required to retain his balance which is to hop back on his secondary leg.

(26:30 - 26:44)
Once again, I have an initial bite on my opponent's legs with ashi garami. My opponent goes to interfere with it. I go to a cross buttock position.

(26:45 - 26:53)
My right foot to the right buttock. As I lose the initial ashi garami, I bump his hands to the floor. Now, my hands come up.

(26:54 - 27:05)
I re-throw the ashi garami in place and I grip the leg. Now, as my opponent goes to recover his base, when he goes to hop, he can't. I'm holding the leg.

(27:06 - 27:18)
So, even a small application of force will put my opponent down. Such a simple strategy but so effective. Sometimes, you don't even have to wait for your opponent to try to interfere with your ashi garami.

(27:19 - 27:37)
It just goes straight into the double leg situation. For example, if I have an initial ashi garami on my training partner, if I see a foot is in range, I'll grab it every time. It's only when the foot is out of range, out here, now I'll use a cross buttock to bring it into range.

(27:38 - 28:08)
And then from here, we put our opponent down. Now, let's look at the third method of breaking an opponent down to a hip. We've seen that breaking someone down to a hip is the third great skill of entering into or completing the general leg lock system.

(28:09 - 28:20)
It's the third essential skill of leg locking. It pertains to situations where we're working underneath people. Whenever we're in the bottom position, it's always in our interest to break them down to the mat.

(28:20 - 28:45)
Let's look at a situation now where we're using a different strategy entirely and a different finishing position. I'll use kamisara for this one to enter into my opponent's legs and then break them down to a hip. From any generic situation where I have an ashi garami, we've seen that our opponents most of the time will look to fight the ashi garami by splitting my legs and breaking the hold on their legs and hips.

(28:46 - 29:17)
Whenever someone goes to play this kind of game, it's very much in our interest to either hold an overwrap grip over my opponent's leg or switch to a scoop grip on my training partner's leg like so. From here, as my opponent breaks the initial ashi garami, I lose it like this. I'm going to make a switch into an X guard situation where my foot goes behind my training partner's knee and my second foot goes in front of the hip and I tilt my training partner's hands down to the mat.

(29:17 - 29:27)
This gives me angle on my training partner. Now, I take my right foot into the cross buttock position. My right foot to my training partner's right buttocks.

(29:28 - 29:41)
My left foot comes through halfway down my training partner's quadricep. So I have what we call a reverse X guard. In a conventional X guard, my right foot goes to my opponent's left knee.

(29:42 - 29:54)
This is a conventional X guard. Right foot to left knee, left foot to left hip. I can have my knees open or closed.

(29:54 - 30:14)
They're both highly effective. Once I get my opponent's hands down to the mat, most of his weight is borne on the hands and as a result, the hips become very, very light. I now make the switch from regular X guard, cross buttock, foot on the quadricep, to reverse X guard.

(30:14 - 30:36)
From the reverse X guard position, we know that whenever we're operating underneath someone, our primary goal is to get their hips directly over our head. If I lift in a straight line, Kyle Massaro feels very heavy and difficult to lift. I want to lift not in a straight line but in a curve out and away, the so-called power curve.

(30:36 - 31:01)
When I lift out in this curve, his far leg will easily come in towards me and the hips will come over my head. As a result, it's a simple thing now to take my outside leg, block the figure of four, and put my training partner down to a hip. Once he's broken down to a hip, from here we go under, over, and lace my training partner's ankles.

(31:02 - 31:33)
Now my opponent is successfully broken down to a hip and to a position where we can easily go into a breaking game. Once again, my opponent is standing over me and we have a basic Ashi Garami on our training partner. From here, he breaks the Ashi Garami, I put my foot in, second foot in, here I have an X guard with an overwrap, the so-called overwrap X guard, as opposed to a conventional X guard where I have a scoop grip on my training partner's leg.

(31:33 - 31:45)
They're both highly effective. I use my knee behind his hamstring to tilt his hands down to the mat. Then I make the switch from X guard to reverse X guard.

(31:46 - 32:09)
My first thing is to bring my knees to my chest, then I lift in a curve around behind my opponent, not a straight line. I lift the curve by bringing my knees in and then turning my body to come up into this very good attacking position. Now, I pull the knee inside my knee line, block a triangle with my legs.

(32:10 - 32:29)
Now, the Kama Sado is resisting strongly. The smart thing for him to do is to stay on his hands. If he's smart, what he will want to do is line himself up with my Ashi Garami by rotating this way, so that when I put a pushing force into his hands, I can't break him down to the mat.

(32:29 - 32:43)
I never want to push into his base of support. Instead, I take my knee and I push across his hips. And as a result, I easily sit him down to the mat into a winning position.

(32:44 - 32:57)
Let's have a look at that again. You remember at the start of the DVD, we talked about the idea of directionality of force. This is one of those key areas where directionality of force will determine your success or failure with the move.

(32:57 - 33:13)
If I push in the wrong direction, I will never break my opponent down to the mat. I must assess the correct direction to apply my forces. And the general rule of thumb is always apply the force across or perpendicular to your opponent's hips.

(33:16 - 33:29)
Here, I have a Rimi Ashi Garami. Kama Sado goes to interfere with it and breaks it apart. I have a choice between going over wrap or scoop grip on my training partner's leg.

(33:29 - 33:40)
I make a quick transition into X Guard. Right now, 100% of Kama Sado's body weight is going down through his legs. If I try to lift him here, it would be impossible.

(33:41 - 34:04)
But if I get most of his body weight onto his hand by tripping him using my knee and his hands down to the floor, I can make a very simple switch to a reverse Ashi Garami. In reverse Ashi Garami, I go cross-buttock with the shoelaces and there to my training partner's quadriceps. I need to bring his hips over my head.

(34:05 - 34:14)
The temptation is to go in a straight line. My calf feels very heavy in a straight line. So instead, I move him in a curve out and around.

(34:14 - 34:27)
I bring my knees to my chest first and then I bring him in the power curve. My lower back is off the ground. My spine is in the rocking chair shape that we talked about earlier.

(34:27 - 34:42)
As a result, as it sits directly over my head, I can easily pull his knee inside my knee line. Now, I want to apply the breakdown force perpendicular to his hips. The Kama Sado stays where he is.

(34:42 - 34:51)
It's so easy. I put him straight down. The only way he can resist me is to walk on his hands.

(34:51 - 35:01)
This is where people make mistakes. They apply the direction of force into their opponent's base of support. No, always across the hips.

(35:02 - 35:34)
So I take my right knee and turn it and lace his ankles into a winning position. We're looking at the general system of leg locks. A big theme of this instructional series is the idea that you're never going to successfully apply heel hooks at the highest levels of competition if you only think of heel hooks as an isolated move.

(35:35 - 36:09)
Any isolated move can quickly be understood and countered. Success in the leg locking game comes from a holistic approach where each move is embedded in a general system that starts with the prerequisites of elements such as grip, distancing, connection, breaking your opponent to a hip, and then ultimately works its way through various forms of Ashi Garami all the way leading to a break. Remember, there are six essential skills of heel hooking.

(36:10 - 36:37)
If you experience failure at any one of those six steps, those six skills, your heel hooks will be ineffective in championship competition. Let's say, for example, you have an outstanding Ashi Garami and a very strong heel hook. That's fine, but if you at first have some kind of faulty method of establishing inside position, you're never going to get into a position to apply those Ashi Garamis and those heel hooks in the first place.

(36:37 - 36:58)
Every subsequent step of the system is built on the success of the antecedent step. You can experience failure at any one of the six steps, so you have to be equally strong at all the various six steps in the chain. As the old cliche goes, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

(36:58 - 37:15)
If you're weak at any one of those six skills, eventually you're going to run into failure at the highest levels. We've seen the first three steps in the general system. These were the idea of establishing grip and inside position.

(37:15 - 37:24)
That's always step number one. We can't really differentiate between grip and inside position. They go together so tightly that I identify them as one skill.

(37:24 - 37:39)
Then we saw the second step, the idea of distance and connection. Those two are so tightly intertwined that I treat them as one skill. Then we saw the third optional skill, which is breaking your opponent down to a hip.

(37:39 - 37:50)
This is only relevant in cases where you're working from underneath your opponent. If you're on top, obviously we skip that step. Now we start getting into the next three finishing steps.

(37:51 - 38:09)
The first of these is so-called heel exposure. After that, we get into the idea of negation, how to negate my opponent's defences to the various locks that we employ. Ultimately, we get down to the sixth and final step, breaking.

(38:10 - 38:59)
These three final steps are best explained and taught, not as a general system, but as part of the three subsystems which I use. Cross-Ashigurami, Straight-Ashigurami and Reverse-Ashigurami. Our teaching is going to go in a different direction now.

We're going to take the first and arguably the most important initial form of Ashigurami, the so-called Straight-Ashiguramis. We're going to show how we go through the idea of a very, very concrete set of steps that will put us into extraordinarily strong breaking positions from where we can actually submit people. So we're going now from a more theoretical approach to leg locking to a more hands-on, nuts-and-bolts practical approach.

(38:59 - 39:28)
Let's begin our study with an understanding, or a clear statement of the Straight-Ashigurami system. Sitting down. Straight-Ashigurami refers to any situation where my opponent's left leg goes over my right hip.

So my opponent's leg does not cross my centre line. It stays on one side of my body. This stands in opposition to Cross-Ashiguramis where my opponent's leg crosses over my centre line.

(39:29 - 39:43)
This position here is very, very different from this position here. They are both essential parts of the general leg lock system. But because they are so different, I treat them and teach them differently.

(39:44 - 39:55)
There's a sense in which my leg lock system is not really one system at all. It is three systems. Cross-Ashigurami, Straight-Ashigurami and Reverse-Ashigurami entwined with each other.

(39:57 - 40:18)
The sum of those three subsystems creates the general system. My approach to the Straight-Ashigurami is quite a bit different from those which came before it. As always, we start off with an Arimi-Ashigurami.

(40:18 - 40:40)
This is our primary method of entering into the Straight-Ashigurami system. We've seen that when we work on the floor, I generally favour a straight shoelace on buttocks position so that I can close a circle around my training partner's hips and legs. This forms an effective closed wedge around my opponent's hip and knee.

(40:40 - 41:02)
This securely locks my opponent's knee inside my knee line. It enables me to put body weight on my opponent's shin, which means that when Kamosara goes to move backwards, I have a strong sense of connection to my opponent. When he goes into a rotational escape, I have a strong sense of connection to my opponent.

(41:03 - 41:30)
You can see my legs alone connect me to him without the use of my hands. Because my hands are free, I can now start using my hands to go into actual locks as opposed to having to desperately hold on to my opponent's legs and prevent myself from actually finishing my opponent. What I'm about to teach you is a complete rendition of the Outside or Straight-Ashigurami game.

(41:30 - 41:49)
You're going to see that there are some significant differences from conventional approaches. One of the most important is the idea that there's no one skill involved in Heel-Hooking. Rather, there are multiple skills.

(41:49 - 42:13)
I'm going to start by showing the four most important skills which are necessary for success in the Straight-Ashigurami game. The first one we've spent quite a bit of time on, which is the idea of distance and connection. We know that the measure of distance is the position of my knee line relative to my opponent's knee.

(42:14 - 42:46)
A simple drill which we can do is to lock around our training partner's ankle. Kamasawa is going to move back and away from me. You can clearly see that his knee is outside of my knee line.

From here, I simply turn my palm and I lift and I can drag him along the mat so that now his knee is back inside my knee line. As a result, I can quickly lock up an Ashigurami that forms a good connection. The form of Ashigurami I use is a Rimming or Entering Ashigurami.

(42:47 - 42:59)
That's my primary method of forming an initial connection to my opponent's leg. A Rimming Ashigurami is an excellent form of Ashigurami for entering the legs. In my opinion, it's the single best one.

(43:00 - 43:34)
However, as good as it is for entering the legs, it's not particularly good for subsequent steps. If the first skill was entering a connection, what's the second skill here? It's to expose my opponent's heel. No matter how strong my Ashigurami is, if I can't reliably expose my opponent's heel, I'm never going to heel hook anybody.

I have to be able to expose my opponent's heel to my wrist. Only when I actually have the lock do I become dangerous to my opponent. No one has got their leg broken by an Ashigurami itself.

(43:35 - 43:56)
What breaks the leg is the combination of Ashigurami and the breaking mechanism, the heel hook. Only in unison do they break people's legs. So, once I've established the first step, the idea of distance and connection, now it's time to go on to step number two of the outside or straight Ashigurami system, which is to expose the heel.

(43:57 - 44:20)
That's where problems start. If I stay within a Rimi Ashigurami and I go down to my shoulder to dig for a heel, something very bad starts to happen. All the weight starts to go off my inside leg and as a result, Kawamasara can pommel his leg through and around and now my heel is exposed to him.

(44:21 - 44:34)
We're both in the same Ashigurami. His foot comes over, he has something of an Rimi Ashigurami on me, but he has heel exposure. My heel is revealed to him, his heel is hidden on the floor.

(44:35 - 44:51)
Let's have a look at that again. We've seen the first step in any Ashigurami system, in this case the straight Ashigurami system, is distance and connection. Once that's been satisfied, we've got to go hunting for our opponent's heel.

(44:53 - 45:08)
To gain entry to my opponent's legs, a Rimi Ashigurami is the single best method. However, when it's time for the second task, the task of exposing my opponent's heel, a Rimi Ashigurami comes up short. In fact, it can make me quite vulnerable.

(45:08 - 45:40)
When I go down to a shoulder in this position, my inside leg becomes unweighted and as a result, Kyle can pummel his legs through, around, and look what we've got. An exposed heel. My heel is exposed to him.

I'm in more danger here than he is. An experienced opponent can simply wait for you to load your weight onto the shoulder, unload the inside leg, and now it's me who's getting finished, not him. He has my heel exposed.

(45:41 - 45:46)
I don't have his exposed. He can heel hook me. I can't heel hook him until I get to his heel.

(45:47 - 46:26)
That's not the kind of game you want to get into. We're touching on a very important theme here. The idea that as the task I'm trying to accomplish changes, my Ashigurami must also change.

I need more than one Ashigurami to get the job done. There's four distinct tasks that we have to fulfil if we're going to apply a successful heel hook here, and I need four different Ashiguramis one for each of those respective tasks. If I try to use a one size fits all, one Ashigurami to perform all four tasks, I will always run into problems.

(46:27 - 46:54)
So when I switch from the first task of entry and connection to the second task of exposing my opponent's heel, I need a new form of Ashigurami. That form of Ashigurami will be an inside Ashigurami. Here, I have a Rumi Ashigurami.

I want to expose Kyle Massaro's heel. I can't do it by going down to his shoulder and digging. I will make myself vulnerable.

(46:55 - 47:05)
So instead, I replace my foot from the hip with a hand on the knee. So my foot goes from hip to floor. Hand on the knee.

(47:05 - 47:17)
Now, I shimmy my hips to the right and I bring my right foot across Kyle Massaro's centerline. As a result, we immediately have heel exposure. I have a strong back heel.

(47:17 - 47:45)
As we saw earlier, a back heel refers to the action of taking my heel back towards my own buttocks. And as a result, we lock in. Now, we have heel exposure.

As a result, I can easily get an initial grip on my training partner. For the purposes of the initial grip, I recommend the use of what we call a false grip. That's where my wrist bends 90 degrees like a gymnast on the Olympic rings who bends his wrist 90 degrees for a stronger grip.

(47:47 - 48:22)
This is not designed for breaking. It's just designed for control. It connects my opponent's shoelaces to my ribs.

Now, we have heel exposure. Let's have a look at that again. My first thing when I enter in on someone is just to form an initial connection that puts their knee inside my knee line.

A Rumi Ashi Garami is perfect and, in my opinion, the single best way of doing this. However, it is not a good method for exposing the heel. Why? Because my knees point outwards, which means Kama Saro can point his toes outwards and hide his heel from me.

(48:23 - 48:51)
As I try to go down to the heel, I expose my own leg to him and now, I can be broken in this position more easily than I can break him. So, instead, we take our foot off, grip our training partner's knee, I push my hips outside his leg and I bring my right foot across his centre line so that my calf muscle goes down the middle of my training partner's quadricep. And what does this do? It immediately exposes my training partner's heel.

(48:53 - 49:11)
As a result, we can quickly lock a false grip. The false grip connects my opponent's shoelaces to my ribcage and forms a wedge on the outside of the heel while my own ribcage forms a wedge on the shoelaces of my opponent's foot. And now, we have heel exposure.

(49:23 - 49:43)
We're starting to go through the nuts and bolts of the straight Ashi Garami system. The best way to understand it is in terms of four distinct steps. The big thing that we're trying to push is that each distinct step or skill requires a different form of Ashi Garami.

(49:44 - 50:00)
For many years, people tended to make no distinction between the Ashi Garami and the lock itself. A big part of my system is to strongly distinguish between those two elements. The Ashi Garami controls my opponent's legs and hips.

(50:01 - 50:27)
The heel hook, or whichever mechanism, the Achilles lock, the figure four toehold, is the actual breaking mechanism. What I'm trying to describe to you is the idea that there are four distinct skills in any successfully applied heel hook in a straight Ashi Garami situation. And we need a different form of Ashi Garami to deal with each one of those distinct skills.

(50:27 - 51:04)
Any given Ashi Garami has good points, bad points, strengths, weaknesses. We need to be able to exploit the strengths of a given Ashi Garami in one area and avoid the weaknesses. So, for example, a Rumi Ashi Garami is extremely good for entering into my opponent's legs.

It's fast, it's quick, it gets quick access and quick control of an opponent's leg and hip. However, it's not very good for exposing my opponent's heel. Much better for that purpose is an inside Ashi Garami, where my leg passes the centre line and exposes my opponent's heel to my wrist so I can start the heel hook game.

(51:04 - 51:39)
Now, as good as the inside Ashi Garami is for attacking my opponent's heel or exposing my opponent's heel, it's not good for the next part of the sequence, which is to deal with my opponent's attempts at escape. We've seen that once I enter into my opponent's legs, we need an initial form of connection so that my knee line captures my opponent's knee. We've seen that after that, we need to expose our opponent's heel.

(51:39 - 52:00)
We did that by passing the leg across and going into the heel, just like so, and locking up, initially applying a one-handed false grip. Now, once we get into this position, you know your opponent feels the danger of a given heel hook. He's going to go into his escape sequences.

(52:00 - 52:18)
The number one forms of escape all involve turning in the direction of the lock. If I stay with an inside Ashi Garami, there's a sense in which I'm applying force with my Ashi Garami in the same direction as my opponent's escape. That's not a good thing.

(52:19 - 52:36)
I always want to oppose the direction of my opponent's escape with my Ashi Garami. My opponent's escapes are based around three primary methods of overcoming my attempts to attack the leg. The first is rotation.

(52:36 - 53:07)
If we go back, the first method of relieving pressure and ultimately escaping is for my opponent to rotate with me. So, if I'm trying to apply breaking force and then I roll, and roll, and roll, I can't apply finalising pressure on my opponent's leg, because the direction of his roll is the same direction as my breaking pressure. Every time I go to apply breaking pressure, he's negating it by rolling in the same direction that I'm applying pressure.

(53:07 - 53:22)
So, we never get through to a break until we go out of balance or what have you. So, that's one way in which you can negate my attempts at a heel hook. A second way is to apply the principle of distance.

(53:24 - 53:51)
If Banara, once I get a hold of his heel, can come up to his knees and put a foot on my buttocks and then push, his knee will come out from my knee line. And as a result, there's so much distance between his knee and my knee line, I simply lose control of the leg. Even if my opponent just moved a matter of inches, he can defeat my lock.

(53:51 - 54:06)
Let's face this way. If I lock up here, you can clearly see Banara's knee is inside my knee line. If he moves even a matter of inches, he is now frustrated with my attempt at a heel hook.

(54:06 - 54:28)
The moment my opponent's knee slips inside to this position, I've lost the heel hook. No amount of pressure now will have any effect. It doesn't look like he's moved very much, but there's a world of difference between this, where his knee is inside my hip and obviously inside my knee line, and here where it is outside the hip and already starting to pass outside my knee line.

(54:28 - 54:48)
Now, the heel hook is doomed to failure. He can either rotate with me to alleviate stress on the knee, or most importantly, play the distance game, where he can do a partial rotation and then free his knee. The next method, of course, is to interfere with the Ashigurami itself.

(54:48 - 55:38)
He can push the Ashigurami leg down and then from here, even though I have the heel, I no longer have a true Ashigurami pressure. Now I can easily turn in either direction to escape the lock. So my opponent has three primary methods of shutting down my attempts at a heel hook.

He can either use rotational methods, where he spins either at the same speed as me, or even better, faster than I'm turning. He can use distance methods, where usually in combination with rotation, he will pull his knee free and escape from my knee line. Or he can just break the structure of my Ashigurami.

Those are the three methods by which he's going to defeat my heel hook. So what I need is an ability to shut down those three defensive elements. I'm going to show you how we do that by switching to a new form of Ashigurami.

(55:40 - 55:53)
Okay, I have an Arumi Ashigurami on Banada. That's good for connection. We saw that when we switched to an inside Ashigurami, like so, we now get a heel exposure.

(55:55 - 56:14)
Now, the problem is that Banada feels the danger, and it's going to go into his escapes. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to lock a very special Ashigurami, where I lock a Senkaku, or triangle, and I put my foot over the far hip. Okay? When I put my foot over the far hip, interesting things start to happen.

(56:14 - 56:26)
You might say to yourself, well, isn't that dangerous? Haven't you exposed your foot to a figure-four toehold here, for example? Well, not really. Because my foot is short. My heel is on my opponent's hip.

(56:26 - 56:34)
In order to get to a heel hook himself, he needs my foot in his armpit. Okay? But my foot is positioned down here on the hip. It's hard for him to access.

(56:35 - 56:47)
Moreover, we're turning in a direction where my heel is hidden from his. I already have his heel. But when he digs for mine, we're going in the wrong direction for him to dig.

(56:47 - 57:22)
He needs me going in this direction to expose my heel. Okay? Now, the other element, and this is perhaps the most important part, is distance. Bernardo's best attempt to get out of here, best strategy for getting out of here, is to come up to his knee and start pulling his leg out in this direction.

That's his best bet. Okay? Now, let's understand something very, very important. When Bernardo employs this strategy, if my knee is pointing up at the ceiling, it's easy for him to free his knee.

(57:23 - 57:34)
And you will often see something that looks like this in competition. A guy gets a heel hook, goes to apply pressure, the man comes up to his knees, quickly pulls, and escapes. You see this all the time.

(57:35 - 57:51)
And yet, interestingly, you almost never see it happen with my students. Why? When my opponent goes to turn, I point my knee at the floor. So that my knee follows my opponent's knee.

(57:52 - 58:10)
If we go back, all the problems here come from situations where my knee remains static in his turns. When he turns, and my knee remains static, that's exactly when he slips out. What I want in these situations, is my knee following his knee.

(58:11 - 58:23)
There is a certain arc through which my opponent rotates. Within that arc, I can break my opponent's leg. If he goes beyond that arc, I can no longer do so.

(58:23 - 58:46)
If I remain static, and my opponent turns, he's gone past the arc of breaking. So what I want to do in these situations, once I lock up and apply pressure, is to get my opponent to turn, and my knee follows his knee. As he turns and runs, I point my knee at the floor.

(58:47 - 59:02)
Now, Bernardo, just run as fast as you can along the man. There's simply no way for him to pull away and play the distance game. Because my knee is pointing down at the man.

(59:04 - 59:29)
When he goes to backstep and rotate all the way over, I simply follow his backstep, and I come out the other side with a strong heel hook in place. So, what did we do? We went to a new form of Ashigurami that completely shuts down the three main forms of escape. Rotation, distance, and breaking the structure of the Ashigurami.

(59:30 - 1:00:08)
Let's have a look at exactly how this functions, once again. I have an Arimi Ashigurami on my training partner. I switch to an inside Ashigurami to expose the heel.

I know what he wants to do now. He wants to start rotating and turning away from me. So, the minute I see this, I lock a Senkaku.

Why is the Senkaku important? Why is that such a big deal? So that my opponent can't break the structure of the Ashigurami. Because now I've got reinforced wedges around my opponent's leg. If my legs are open, Bernardo can push... Bernardo can push my foot and break the structure of the Ashigurami.

(1:00:09 - 1:00:23)
But when I lock a Senkaku, or triangle, and lock it in here, with my knees pinching together, when he goes to push my legs apart, this goes to push my legs apart. It's very, very difficult. Not in the time available.

(1:00:23 - 1:00:31)
It's extremely difficult. When he goes to go for a counter leg lock on me, my heels are hidden on the floor. And so I'll always get the break first.

(1:00:31 - 1:00:46)
So that's not a viable option. When he tries to spin and rotate, it's very easy for me to follow his rotation. So, spinning and rotating is taken out as a viable option.

(1:00:47 - 1:01:04)
His last and best hope is to create distance between his knee and my knee line. But by pointing my knee at the mat, when he goes to do this, he can run as much as he wants. With no hands.

(1:01:04 - 1:01:30)
Really try to run. It's impossible to get away from. Now, we've shut down all of his attempts at escape.

The only thing remaining is the final step of breaking. We know that the right thing for us to do is always to break our opponent down to a hip. So what we do is we apply pressure that's going to force my training partner into a final turn.

(1:01:31 - 1:01:45)
As he makes the final turn, we're going to see in our next step the skill of breaking. So we've got three critical steps underway. First, entry and connection.

(1:01:46 - 1:01:56)
We used Arumi Ashigurami as the vehicle for that. Then, heel exposure. We had to switch from Arumi Ashigurami to Inside Ashigurami.

(1:01:56 - 1:02:18)
My foot went across his centre line and exposed his heel. Once we had a wrist around our opponent's heel, we locked our hands and from there, we were able to get our opponent to a situation where we could lock a third Ashigurami. A Senkaku with our feet over our opponent's far hip.

(1:02:18 - 1:02:36)
This far hip Ashi is a very, very useful way of locking our hips to our opponent's hips. In any situation where we're locked in in that fashion, my opponent has only three avenues of escape. He's either got to separate my legs, break the Ashigurami.

(1:02:36 - 1:02:47)
That's impossible because I've got a triangle locked around his hips. He's got to rotate faster than me. That's impossible because I simply point my knee at the floor and that guarantees we rotate at the same speed.

(1:02:48 - 1:03:23)
Or, he's got to try and kick out and create distance between my knee line and his knee. And that's also impossible because we're locked in with a reinforced wedge, the Senkaku. And because my knee's pointing at the floor, I can literally have my opponent run and carry my entire body weight and the Ashigurami will stay fixed in place.

That's going to put us into the fourth and final step. This is the step of breaking our opponent. And from here, we use a very unique form of Ashigurami, the so-called Outside Ashigurami, where both of my feet end up on the outside of my opponent's legs.

(1:03:25 - 1:03:52)
This is going to bring in perhaps the single most important theme of the entire leg lock system. The idea that when it's time to go to break an opponent's legs, it is absolutely crucial that my Ashigurami go in the opposite direction of the actual break. Let's look at why so many people failed with heel hooks for so many years.

(1:03:55 - 1:04:35)
Most people make no distinction between the force of the breaking mechanism and the force of the Ashigurami. If you learned nothing else from this video, learn this. When it's time to break someone's leg, the force of your Ashigurami must oppose the force of your break.

You must distinguish between the mechanism of control, Ashigurami, and the mechanism of breaking, the heel hook. For generations, people never distinguished between the two. And so you would see many experts teaching an Ashigurami that went in a given direction, and a heel hook that went in the same direction.

(1:04:36 - 1:04:55)
Because of that, there was no reason why the opponent couldn't simply spin out of the lock. That was easy. Or, even worse, you would go to apply pressure on the heel hook, but because your Ashigurami and the heel hook went in the same direction, your Ashigurami more or less pushed him out of the heel hook.

(1:04:55 - 1:05:40)
And so there was inadequate pressure to actually get successful results. Because of this, people had to apply more and more force on the heel hook to get any form of result. So you would see people violently gripping across the chest with results that tended to either result in no break at all, which is an ineffective lock, or a catastrophic break because it was applied without control in the gym.

And so heel hooks got a terrible reputation as a move which either wasn't very effective, or tended to result in bad breaks amongst the beginners. What we want to do is to do the exact opposite of this. We never want our Ashigurami going in the same direction as the force of a lock.

(1:05:40 - 1:05:58)
How do I know which direction the force of the Ashigurami is going? Well, I can look across a room and tell you exactly where it's going. It goes in the direction that the knees are pointing. Wherever my knees are pointing tells me which direction the force of the Ashigurami is going.

(1:05:59 - 1:06:24)
So if my knees point to the inside, that's the same direction as the heel hook. For a right-handed heel hook, everything is going from right to left. But so is my Ashigurami.

That's going from right to left. So Bernardo finds it very easy to spin and escape. Okay? What I want to do is to create a situation where my knees point in the opposite direction of the heel hook.

(1:06:25 - 1:06:37)
And the single best, tightest method of doing this, it's not the only one, but it's in my opinion the best, is the outside Ashigurami. Why is it the best? Because it's a reinforced wedge. My feet are locked.

(1:06:38 - 1:06:51)
I could apply an Ashigurami with my feet pointing to the outside with an Urimi Ashigurami. It can be done. And if your opponents are not of a high skill level, I'll often do this.

(1:06:51 - 1:07:03)
You'll often see myself and my students apply a heel hook just from here. It's usually because the opponent is not very knowledgeable about heel hooks. And if I feel that, then yes, absolutely, I can break them right here.

(1:07:03 - 1:07:33)
But you'll notice my knees are pointing to the outside. My knees always betray the direction of force of the Ashigurami. Here, clearly, the knees are pointing to the outside.

So as I apply the heel hook, even one-handed, you can see the heel hook is going over my left shoulder, but my Ashigurami is going out to my right-hand side. Okay? And so I can quickly create tension in the leg. Okay? But this is an unreinforced wedge.

(1:07:34 - 1:07:51)
So my opponent can easily push the foot down and cause problems for me. The beauty of an outside Ashigurami is that whether my feet are locked top over bottom or bottom over top, here, my feet reinforce each other. So when Banara goes to push my feet apart, it's shockingly difficult.

(1:07:51 - 1:08:04)
Okay? And then from here, my knees are pointing to the outside. Even a minor lift on the heel will create breaking pressure. Okay? Now, we've seen the critical four steps.

(1:08:05 - 1:08:13)
Entry and connection is number one. We use a Rimi Ashigurami as the method of controlling the legs. Heel exposure is step number two.

(1:08:13 - 1:08:29)
We've seen inside Ashigurami is the primary method of doing this. The third step is negation of our opponent's attempts at escape. Far hip Ashigurami is our favourite method of preventing the three forms of escape.

(1:08:30 - 1:09:02)
Rotation, distance, and breaking the Ashigurami. And now we're going into the fourth and final phase of heel hooking, breaking. And we've seen our favourite method of doing this is from the so-called outside Ashigurami.

Let's have a look at how the whole sequence was tied together in four simple, easy to understand steps that can be done in a matter of seconds on a strongly resisting opponent. We start off with an Arimi Ashigurami. Just like so.

(1:09:03 - 1:09:42)
So when Banada goes to pull away from me, it's very, very difficult. We get to the heel very quickly. Okay? Once we have the heel from the inside Ashigurami, okay, we make a switch to far hip and lock up.

When Banada tries to get away from me, I point my knees down to the floor. He goes pull, pull, pull. It's very, very difficult.

I lock up the heel hook and I turn and create pressure. Okay? Now we have the outside Ashigurami in place. I make sure that my two legs back heel, pulling back, never pushing with my legs, always pulling.

(1:09:42 - 1:09:50)
My top knee comes over the top and we get a strong breaking position with the outside Ashigurami heel hook.


## Volume 4

(0:04 - 0:16)
We saw earlier that there are distinct steps in this system. Okay, all the steps are arranged sequentially. If I can't establish inside position, the whole system stops right there.

(0:16 - 0:32)
Okay, so everything begins with inside position. Once we establish inside position, then it's all about creating a sense of distance and connection. I have to be close enough to capture my opponent's knee within my knee line and form a solid connection to my opponent's hips and legs.

(0:33 - 0:53)
In the case of the straight Ashigurami game, we've seen that that form of initial connection is typically an Arimi Ashigurami or entering Ashigurami. That was a great way to form a solid connection to our opponent's hips and legs. Then we went to phase two of that particular subsystem.

(0:54 - 1:41)
The idea of creating heel exposure. If I can't expose my opponent's heel, nothing else counts. I don't care how good you're Ashigurami, I don't care how strong you are, I don't care how tight your heel looks.

If you can't physically expose your opponent's heel, nothing else is going to follow on. We've seen inside Ashiguramis have the best method of exposing our opponent's heel in this situation. Then, once you've exposed your opponent's heel, in competition, that's when the panic buttons start lighting up in your opponent.

They will do everything possible to get out of that situation. You will be absolutely stunned at the amount of resistance you will receive at world championship level from talented athletes who know how to get out of these positions, who have a good understanding of Jiu-Jitsu and good understanding of Legos. The amount of resistance you have to deal with is staggering.

(1:42 - 1:54)
You need every possible mechanism to shut that resistance down. We've seen that resistance comes in three forms. Your opponent can either break up your Ashigurami, destroying the integrity of the Ashigurami itself.

(1:54 - 2:12)
They can start rotating in a way where they're rotating faster than you're rotating and shut down your ability to apply force to the heel. Or, they can play a distance game and pull their knee out from the knee line. In practise, usually it's a combination of all three which is used to escape from a heel hook.

(2:13 - 2:47)
We saw a four-step system to shut this down. We formed a connection to our opponent's leg, we exposed the heel, we shut down their escape attempts and now we got into a breaking position. We've seen that when it comes time to break, we favour more than or any other in the straight Ashigurami subsystem.

The idea of an outside Ashigurami finish. The key to an outside Ashigurami is to understand that we get opposing forces. My Ashigurami goes in one direction and my mechanism of breaking the heel hook goes in another.

(2:48 - 3:00)
Think about this like tearing a piece of paper. If I put a piece of paper in your hand and ask you to tear it, it's the easiest thing in the world. Why? Because when you go to rip the paper, your hands go in opposing directions.

(3:02 - 3:19)
Breaking someone's leg or tearing someone's leg is no different from tearing a piece of paper. Ultimately, it's about putting forces in opposing directions to get the job done. The problem most people have is they apply breaking forces in one direction.

(3:19 - 3:36)
Tragically, they usually do it in the same direction that their Ashigurami is going. So, not only do they have a weak breaking force, but they're actually assisting their opponent in escaping by pushing them in the exact direction of their escape. It's a disaster and that's why heel hooks were so ineffective for so long.

(3:36 - 4:06)
What I did is to change the way people finished heel hooks in the Ashigurami positions by opposing the force of the Ashigurami directly against their opponent's escape and against the direction of the break. I strongly differentiated between the Ashigurami, which goes in one direction, and the break, which goes in the opposite direction. In this way, you can create strongly opposed forces on the leg that will tear a man's leg just as easily as you tear a piece of paper.

(4:07 - 4:40)
We need to go now into the precise elements of breaking mechanics. I'm a huge believer in the idea of coaching breaking mechanics to a point where you ultimately come to believe that if you can get into a breaking position on anybody in the world, you can break their leg with the greatest of ease. If you don't believe you have this power in top level competition, you won't fight hard to get to your opponent's legs.

(4:41 - 4:50)
I don't care how smooth your Ashigurami entries are. I don't care how good you are at exposing your opponent's ankle. I don't care how good you are at negating their escapes.

(4:50 - 5:19)
If you don't believe you have the capacity to break your opponent's leg at will, you will not try hard under duress and pressure and competition to get through to an Ashigurami and get to the break. Your own mind will find ways to prevent you from getting there. But if you believe in your heart of hearts that you have the ability to break a man's leg with a well-applied heel hook under the stress of competition, you will find ways to get to that breaking position in the heat of combat.

(5:19 - 5:39)
Let's have a look at some of the fine details of breaking from an outside Ashigurami situation. We know the big picture. The big picture is I want my Ashigurami going in one direction and my breaking mechanism, the heel hook, going in the opposite direction, just like tearing a piece of paper.

(5:39 - 6:00)
We know already that the force of my Ashigurami is always revealed by the direction my knees are pointing. Wherever my knees point, that's where the force, the direction of force is being applied in the Ashigurami. We know that typically outside Ashigurami is used as part of the four-step sequence.

(6:00 - 6:18)
We start with a Rimi Ashigurami, we go into Inside Ashigurami, we go across into Far Hip Ashigurami, and now ultimately we end up in the Outside Ashigurami to finish our opponent. When I go into Outside Ashigurami, there are sub-varieties of Ashigurami. I can just have my feet close together.

(6:18 - 6:25)
I can post my foot on my training partner's hip. I can have bottom leg under. I can have bottom leg over.

(6:26 - 6:37)
They're all good in terms of breaking power. Some are slightly safer than others. I usually play between all of these minor variations and I've had good results with all of them.

(6:37 - 6:56)
Which one you choose ultimately will be a personal choice. Now, when it's time to go in and break my training partner's leg, I want to maximise my use of lever and fulcrum. So often I see people failing to do this by gripping improperly.

(6:57 - 7:14)
So often I see people, when they go to put a grip in, putting their wrist in a mechanically disadvantageous position. Most people are happy simply to lock their hands and just work for the heel hook from this position. Don't be one of those people.

(7:14 - 7:34)
There's a clear demarcation line which signals whether or not I'm working mechanically and in a mechanically efficient way with lever and fulcrum here. That line is your opponent's ankle. When I look at my opponent's ankle, I want to take my wrist and ensure that my wrist operates below my opponent's ankle.

(7:35 - 8:02)
The moment my wrist starts to go above my opponent's ankle, it's very easy for my opponent to point his toes and slip his heel inside my wrist. This is a constant source of trouble. In addition, even if I go to apply breaking pressure now, I'm doing so in a way where I cannot employ simultaneously an efficient pushing and pulling force on my opponent's leg.

(8:03 - 8:22)
I've said a number of times now, I must work with opposing forces when it comes time to break my opponent's leg. It's important you understand there are two opposing forces, not one. The first opposing force is between the heel hook and the ashigurami.

(8:22 - 8:38)
That's the first, but there's a second one. That's the distinction between the push on the toes and the pull on the heel. Ultimately, what I want to do is to create a pull on the heel and a simultaneous push on the toes.

(8:39 - 8:52)
If I am not doing that, I am never going to be able to maximise my breaking pressure with a heel hook. So there are two ends to the lever of the foot, not one. The first end is the line of the toes.

(8:53 - 9:07)
That's this line that goes from the first knuckle of the big toe to the first knuckle of the smallest toe. I need to take my opponent's toes and put them into my bicep. Not the armpit, the bicep.

(9:09 - 9:29)
I need to line my forearm up with my opponent's foot. The more my foot, sorry, the more my forearm lines up with my opponent's shin, the less successful I will be. I want my forearm to line up with the foot here.

(9:30 - 9:48)
Never with the shin. When my forearm lines up with the shin, a simple pointing of his toes and a heel slip, he'll escape every time. I put the toes in the bicep and I line everything up with my wrist below his ankle with the foot.

(9:49 - 10:06)
When I go to lock, I have several alternatives. The most versatile is a palm-to-palm lock. Off the palm-to-palm lock, I get an ability to use my forearm as a lever arm on my opponent's shin, like so.

(10:07 - 10:24)
This is one useful form of lock. Another very useful form of lock in this situation is for me to cross my wrists, like so. This has the advantage of reducing the circumference of the grip around my opponent's heel and creating strong pressure.

(10:24 - 10:32)
I can go further with this and lock figures of four. I can go still further and lock reverse figures of four. They're all good.

(10:32 - 10:43)
I'll be spending some time on this very shortly. But our first thing is to make sure that our forearm lines up with our training partner's foot. That's always our number one concern.

(10:44 - 11:04)
In order to maximise my use of lever and fulcrum in this situation, I have to understand two ends of the lever. Toe, toe line, and heel below the ankle. So that when I go to lock up with my training partner and my feet come in, I can go into a strong finishing position.

(11:04 - 11:12)
When I go to finish, I need to do two things. I need to push on the toes and pull on the heel. So we get opposing forces.

(11:13 - 11:33)
The only way I can do this is to start by turning my right elbow back into my ribs. Then by coming up on my right elbow and lifting, I generate extreme breaking pressure. So, when I lock in, I don't want to be down on my shoulder.

(11:34 - 11:45)
I want to do my finishes on my elbow. The first thing is I connect my elbow to my ribs. That's going to create a very strong pushing force on the toe line.

(11:47 - 12:00)
Then I want to lift on the heel so that my head rises in a well-applied heel hook. There's a critical rule which you must understand. The rule of head and hands.

(12:01 - 12:22)
If my head, as I apply the heel hook, moves away from my hands, power will bleed out of the heel hook. Wherever my head goes, my hands must follow so that everything moves and the distance between my head and hands never changes. I'll say this again.

(12:22 - 12:39)
If the head moves and the hands don't, all of the power will bleed rapidly out of the heel hook. I must form, contour my body over his, and then head and hands move together. With the head moving in a curve away and up.

(12:39 - 12:49)
The head and hands must move in a curve away from the mat. In this way, you can create ungodly breaking pressure. So, our drill.

(12:50 - 13:06)
We put our fist inside and we put the toes inside our bicep. We align our forearm with our training partner's foot. We make sure our wrist is below the ankle, never above the ankle.

(13:09 - 13:23)
I'm going to demonstrate is a palm to palm grip. I cover my training partner's shoelaces with my chest. I employ a back heel that makes sure my ashi garami goes in one direction and the heel hook goes in another.

(13:23 - 13:55)
Now, I begin everything with a push on the toes by connecting my elbows to my ribs and then a pull on the heel where my head and hands never change distance between each other. I'll just demonstrate one time. Okay, once again, we're in the outside ashi garami position and I want to go in on my opponent's leg.

(13:55 - 14:11)
I need to take my opponent's toe line to my bicep. So, I lift and I put the toes into the bicep. The next thing is I put my wrist below his ankle, just like so.

(14:12 - 14:25)
Then from here, when we lock up, we're going to start with a palm to palm grip. I want to use my elbow on top of the shin to lock everything in place. My feet pull inwards.

(14:25 - 14:34)
I connect my elbow in towards my own ribs. I haven't even begun the lock yet. I've only just put tension in the leg.

(14:35 - 14:46)
From here, we start the action of lifting the heel and we'll get the break. That's tough. Jesus, that was strong.

(14:50 - 15:26)
We're starting now to get into the fourth and final phase of one of the most important subsystems of the overall general leg lock system, the straight ashi garami subsystem. We're looking at the idea of the breaking phase, which is the combination of a series of steps. It began with entering and connecting to our opponent's legs and hips, then creating heel exposure, then the idea of negating our opponent's attempts at escape, and then finally finishing our opponent with a strong break.

(15:26 - 15:44)
I want to spend some time now on a general theory of breaking in jiu-jitsu. Jiu-jitsu, of course, is based around the idea of ultimately controlling people until you can either break a limb or strangle them. It's very, very important we have a clear understanding of what we should be trying to do any time we go in to break someone's joints.

(15:45 - 16:04)
There are three critical elements behind the general theory of breaking. The first we've already alluded to. This is the idea that whenever we go to tear someone's joints, knees, arms, or what have you, it's very, very important that we work with forces in opposing directions.

(16:04 - 16:22)
There is a direct analogy between tearing pieces of paper and tearing knees. You have to be able to apply forces upon your opponent's knees and ankles in opposing directions. As a general rule, I want my ashi-gurami going in one direction and my breaking mechanism, the heel hook, going in another.

(16:23 - 16:38)
Now, a second key element to the idea of breaking. The notion of follow-through. It is absolutely essential that you be able to take an opponent up to the point of breaking and then go beyond it.

(16:39 - 16:55)
Just as a good boxer never throws a punch at his opponent, but rather through his opponent, so too will submission holds. All the time I see talented athletes who can get to a breaking point. I'm not interested in you getting to a breaking point.

(16:55 - 17:03)
I'm interested in how you're going to go past the breaking point. This is the notion of follow-through. Think about a golfer hitting a golf ball.

(17:04 - 17:26)
Imagine we had a golf ball set up on a tee and we went to swing as hard as we could, but the second we made contact, we stopped the club. How far do you think that golf ball would travel? Not very far at all. Compare that with a golfer who not only makes connection with the ball, but follows through all the way and sends it hundreds of metres down the fairway.

(17:27 - 17:46)
When you go to break the human joints, you must do the same thing. You must be able to get to the breaking point and still have sufficient drive to be able to go far beyond it and through. Let's have a look at a situation where working from outside Ashigurami, we see exactly how this applies.

(17:47 - 18:15)
We've seen that once we get in on our training partner's legs and put ourselves in a breaking position, there's a certain point where we put tension into our training partner's legs. When I start the action of pushing on my training partner's toes and pulling on the heel, there comes a certain point where we're getting close to the break. I'm going to take Bernardo close to a point where there's some tension in the leg.

(18:15 - 18:26)
I'll just stop there. Now, you can clearly see my body is not anything close to being fully extended. This is where I am, and this is where Bernardo will begin tapping.

(18:27 - 18:49)
But you can clearly see that if I remove Bernardo's foot, from here, I still have a tremendous movement potential far beyond the point of tapping. I always have to arrange things so that when I get to the breaking point, I have a capacity to continue going on and through. If I don't have that, I'm not going to be able to break people's legs.

(18:49 - 19:00)
Yes, you'll put people under stress. Yes, you'll make them uncomfortable. But at world championship level, there has to be a viable threat of a genuine break if people are going to tap.

(19:01 - 19:22)
You will be stunned at how much pain, pressure, and torment people are prepared to deal with in pursuit of gold medals and money. In order to make people tap at that level, there has to be a strong sense of follow through. So once again, I can never have my body at full extension by the time I arrive at a tapping point.

(19:22 - 19:50)
There has to be some degree where when I walk into my opponent here, Bernardo is ready to tap here, but I still have an ability to follow through on my training partner. How do we train this ability to develop follow through? My favourite method of training this is the one-handed drill. This is where I perform a heel hook on my training partner with only one hand.

(19:51 - 20:15)
When we're in competition, of course, we want to lock our hands together to maximise our breaking ability. But in training, what I will often have students do is work from a situation where they lock up with one hand, just like so. From here, they apply the ashi garami with their legs, and with one hand, they practise the skill of turning the corner and then forming a lift on the heel.

(20:16 - 20:41)
Once you get to a position like this, there's going to come a point where just the action of your forearm muscles can generate a tap in an opponent. My hands are not even locked, and yet my opponent is in a position where they can't really tolerate much more. From here, I can generate tremendous follow through pressure, which will go through my opponent's leg.

(20:42 - 20:57)
I'll say this again because it's so important. It's not enough to get to a breaking point. You have to train yourself to get to a breaking point and still have sufficient follow through to go through and get a decisive break should the situation demand it.

(21:02 - 21:16)
We're looking at a general theory of breaking. We've seen already two key components. The first is this idea that we want forces in opposing directions upon the joint that we're attacking.

(21:16 - 21:27)
Until you have opposing directions, you'll never generate a genuine ripping force. Think always of the analogy of a piece of paper. Two hands moving in opposite directions makes it such an easy task.

(21:29 - 21:42)
Second was the idea of follow through. The idea here was that any time we're engaged in athletic activity, we have to project forces upon our opponent. Whether it be with a punch, a throw, or a strike upon something with a club.

(21:43 - 21:55)
We have to be able to follow through the object upon which we're imposing that force. You can't just go to the object and stop. You have to go through the object in order to actually do damage.

(21:56 - 22:13)
Joint breaking is exactly the same. I have to be able to arrange my body in such a way that I get to the breaking point and I still have a strong potential to continue in the direction of the break in order to fully break the limb. Now, the third key element in our theory of breaking.

(22:13 - 22:29)
The idea of creating tension and taking the slack out of the joint prior to breaking. Think about an analogy. If I hang a rope from the ceiling and the rope is very long and coils around the floor so that the rope is very slack.

(22:30 - 22:41)
If I give you a sharp knife and ask you to cut that rope, you will have to whip your hand at tremendous speed in order to be able to go through the rope. Why? Because the rope is slack. There's no tension in the rope.

(22:42 - 23:01)
So the only way to go through it is through speed. If I take that same rope and I stretch it from the ceiling tight down to the floor with a heavy weight so that it's tight and vibrating like a piano wire. Now, when you take that same knife, it's the easiest thing in the world to cut it with just a single blow.

(23:01 - 23:23)
Why? Because there's tension in the rope and as a result the cut will have a catastrophic effect upon the rope. Human joints are exactly the same. If my opponent's joint is in a relaxed state of being where there's no tension whatsoever upon the ligaments and tendons, it's very hard to break the joints.

(23:24 - 23:48)
But if I first create conditions where my opponent's tendons and ligaments are vibrating with tension and tightness, then the act of breaking is extremely easy. Let's have a look at a demonstration. Whenever I get into a breaking position, it's up to me to create a sense of tension and slack removal before I begin the actual break.

(23:48 - 24:08)
So when I come into Kawasara's leg and lock up and I get everything in place, my first thing is to maximise tension in the ligaments and tendons in the knee and ankle before I even begin the action of breaking. This is done in several distinct steps, the most important of which is my Ashigurami. My legs backheel.

(24:08 - 24:23)
Again, backheeling refers to the action of my heels coming back to my own buttocks, just like so. From here, I want to start positioning my head. I bring my head around, lined up, so that my body goes into a straight line.

(24:23 - 24:30)
I don't want my body bent, like so. That relieves tension on my training partner. So the first action is the backheel of my legs.

(24:31 - 24:48)
Then my head goes around so my body starts to go into a straight line. Then we connect both of our elbows close to our ribcage. As the elbows come in close to the ribcage, the head and the hands move together so that we feel extreme tension coming into the leg.

(24:48 - 25:04)
I can feel at this point that Carl Massaro's tendons and ligaments are starting to vibrate. At that point, even a small amount of additional pressure will create the break that I'm looking for. What I don't want is to attack my opponent's heel in a state of relaxation.

(25:05 - 25:19)
You often see people make this mistake. There's no tension whatsoever in either my legs or his, and then they try to use speed to jump into the lock. It's a hit or miss policy where most of the time it misses and occasionally when it hits it's an uncontrolled break.

(25:20 - 25:33)
A much better way for us to operate is always to lock everything up and get that tension running through my training partner's body. You will see this in your opponent's musculature. The actual legs start to tighten up.

(25:33 - 25:46)
The muscles around the legs start to go into a protective mode where they tighten up around my opponent's body. You'll feel that tension through your opponent's body. Now, with maximum tension, the break becomes so easy.

(25:46 - 26:07)
The result is that you can break people in minimal distance, and that's what you're looking for. If I have to move my opponent's body or my own body a significant distance to get a break, that means the chances of success in international competition are relatively low. The object is to be able to minimise the distance in which I can affect the break.

(26:07 - 26:30)
This is done by transmitting tremendous tension throughout the leg first prior to the break so that the break itself comes from just a tiny movement. It's very, very difficult for your opponent to stop those small movements. As we lock up, you can see from here I start the tension at the legs.

(26:30 - 26:52)
The legs pull me into my opponent, we tie everything up, and now in a matter of millimetres I can get a break. As opposed to a situation where there's no real tension in the legs and I have to move significant distances to get any effect at all. This is the third keynote theme in our theory of breaking.

(26:53 - 27:26)
We've seen the ideas of opposing forces, the idea of follow-through, and now the idea of taking the slack out of the joint first prior to the break. If we can reliably perform these three behaviours prior to actually trying to break the joint, you're going to have a lot of success and put your opponents under a lot of pressure with your heel hooking. We've been looking at the notion of breaking mechanics for heel hooking.

(27:27 - 27:47)
One of the most important components of a strong breaking heel hook is the nature in which I grip my opponent's legs. We've seen different Ashiguramis, we've seen how we go to exert force at the end of a lever. Let's look now at the role that different grips play when we go to attack our opponent's legs.

(27:48 - 28:01)
First, a little backdrop on gripping. I can grip my hands in various different kinds of ways, and as we progress with different grips you'll notice something interesting starts to happen. When I lock my hands together there's obviously different ways I can do so.

(28:01 - 28:18)
The first is generally a ten-finger method where my ten fingers lock up with each other like so. When I lock a ten-finger method you'll see there's a certain circumference around my arms, the circle of my arms. As I go through different grips that circumference gets smaller.

(28:19 - 28:33)
When I change from ten-finger to palm-to-palm, there's a small decrease in the circumference of my arms. As I go to a wrist-to-wrist grip that circumference gets even smaller. When I go to a figure-four grip it goes even smaller still.

(28:34 - 29:01)
So, in the case of strangulation for example, if I start off with a certain grip like so, the wide circumference makes for a rather inefficient strangling grip. As I tighten things up, by going to a palm-to-palm grip, we get a tighter circumference around the neck and a tighter strangle. And so ultimately, by the time we use figure-four methods, we have a very tight grip around the neck and as a result, very strong strangulation.

(29:02 - 29:18)
So, as we progress from ten-finger to palm-to-palm, to wrist-to-wrist, to figure-four grips, the circumference of our arms decreases. We can use this in the case of heel hooks. Very often, I will start with a palm-to-palm grip.

(29:19 - 29:29)
In my opinion, this is the most versatile form of gripping that I work with. And it has certain advantages to it that we'll soon see. But this is not the only way of working.

(29:29 - 29:50)
And we've seen that as we progress through various grips, leading all the way up to figure-four, we're decreasing the circumference of our arms around our training partner's ankle, you can get additional tightness. And myself and my students will often employ these methods to create stronger heel hooks in certain scenarios. Let's have a look at the pros and cons of each different kind of grip.

(29:51 - 30:05)
Working from an outside-Ashi-Gurami situation, since that's our favourite breaking grip, we go to work like so. Let's look first at the palm-to-palm grip. The advantage of palm-to-palm is that it's very versatile, and it does have one very good mechanical feature.

(30:06 - 30:49)
When I come up and lock onto my training partner's ankle, always working below the heel, when I lock my palm-to-palm grip, the wide circumference that it generates enables me to take my elbow and employ that top elbow as a wedge on top of my training partner's shin. If I have my elbow outside my opponent's shin, there's a lot of slack around my opponent's heel, and quite easy for my opponent to start escaping. But when I lock up on my training partner and I put my elbow on top of the heel like so, it tightens everything up, and it creates a situation where my two elbows come in very close to each other, and now from here we get tremendous breaking force.

(30:52 - 31:08)
Nonetheless, there's times, for whatever reason, you feel you cannot get your elbow on top of the shin. And now the palm-to-palm grip will tend to be relatively ineffective. It might be because my opponent is posting his hand inside my tricep, and as a result I can't get my elbow in the desired position.

(31:09 - 31:27)
In these situations, I will switch grips, and I will go to a wrist-to-wrist grip, like so. Once I employ a wrist-to-wrist grip, I can no longer get my elbow on top of my shin. But I don't need to, because the circumference of my arm grip is decreased, so I get tightness in other ways.

(31:27 - 31:50)
Now, I lock my elbow outside my opponent's shin, instead of on top. As Kamosara goes to hold me off in situations like this, it's extremely easy for me to generate bone-breaking force in this, or ligament tearing force, in this position. So if I feel I cannot get my desired elbow position, a nice alternative for me is to lock in a wrist-to-wrist grip on my training partner.

(31:51 - 32:05)
Now, we get very, very strong breaking mechanics. This can become even stronger, or even tighter, when I lock up a figure-four grip on my training partner's ankle, like so. Now, when he goes to move away, we get tremendous breaking pressure.

(32:05 - 32:24)
This has an additional benefit. It puts my chest as a wedge on top of my training partner's shoelaces, and it almost precludes the idea of hand-fighting. When my opponent goes to separate my hands, there's just nothing to grab, and as a result, we quickly get tremendous breaking pressure, regardless of our orientation.

(32:25 - 32:37)
Now, the last, and arguably the strongest, of all these grips is the reverse figure-four grip. I start off like so. My opponent is interested in stopping my hands from locking.

(32:37 - 32:57)
So I shake my arms out, I pass my arms around the corner, and I put what appears to be the wrong wrist inside and underneath my opponent's heel. Now, I get a unique ability to be able to push my elbow in towards my training partner's hips. At the same time, I can pull on the heel.

(32:58 - 33:31)
This grip is so strong that even from the weakest forms of ashi-garami break, even when my opponent is turned over, from here, you can still get tremendous breaking pressure by pointing your elbow at your training partner's buttocks and lifting on the heel. We will often make use of these various grips when we're going into the breaking phase. Once I get my initial grip in place, I see the resistance I'm getting and I assess whether I'm going to go palm-to-palm, which leaves some space for my opponent to hand-fight.

(33:31 - 33:44)
He can separate my hands here. Wrist-to-wrist, which greatly closes the space and makes hand-fighting much more difficult. Figure-four, which almost completely closes hand-space and makes hand-fighting almost impossible.

(33:45 - 34:18)
And reverse figure-four, which is ridiculously strong to the point where if my opponent goes to move out, twist down, etc., regardless of our orientation, we're going to be getting very, very strong forms of break. So those are different ways to employ hand-grips to up the volume of the breaking power of your heel-hooks. We're looking at the idea of breaking mechanics in the case of the straight Ashi-Urami family that we're looking at.

(34:18 - 34:34)
All of our best breaks occur out of the outside Ashi-Urami position. That's our preferred breaking position when we're dealing with very strong, talented opponents. It's okay just to go through the whole cycle with a Rumi Ashi-Urami or the less experienced opponents, that's fine.

(34:34 - 34:52)
We'll come back to that later. But when we're dealing with the world championship level, the toughest opponents, we typically go through a cycle of Ashi-Uramis until we arrive at the preferred breaking Ashi-Urami outside Ashi-Urami. Now, we've been talking a lot about grips.

(34:52 - 35:07)
We've been looking at a general theory of breaking. Now it's absolutely critical that we look at the function of our legs in breaking our opponent's legs. Remember, if you have to rely on your hands and arms to break people's legs, you're not going to have that much success.

(35:07 - 35:22)
Ultimately, the real horsepower of your breaking will come from your legs and your hips. It is critical you understand this. Now, you'll remember at the start of this DVD, we talked a little bit about the idea of levers and fulcrums.

(35:22 - 35:38)
This is where this kind of talk starts to become very, very useful. We saw that one of the important characteristics of a good breaking fulcrum in Jiu-Jitsu is the hardness and the placement of the fulcrum. The harder the fulcrum, the better.

(35:39 - 35:53)
If I try to break an object over a soft fulcrum, it's very, very difficult, often impossible. If I need to break a piece of wood, and I have a choice between putting it or breaking it over a deflated soccer ball versus a hard brick, of course, I'm going to choose the hard brick. It's a better breaking fulcrum.

(35:54 - 36:07)
So too with the human body. When I go to break someone's joints, I want to bring them over the bony, hard elements of my hip bones, not over the soft inner thighs. Heel hooking often employs this simple principle.

(36:09 - 36:35)
Let's look also at the critical notion of directionality of force. When I go to apply my Ashi-Gurami, the overwhelming majority of the breaking power of an outside Ashi-Gurami and a straight or outside heel hook comes from the inside leg. This is something that was not well understood for many, many years.

(36:36 - 36:50)
You have two legs in any given Ashi-Gurami. You have an inside leg between his legs, and an outside leg. I have to learn to cycle my use of inside and outside leg depending upon what I want to do.

(36:51 - 37:10)
When we looked at the initial system, a Rumi Ashi-Gurami, inside and outside leg are neutral. When I go to expose my opponent's heel, I have to use the outside leg as a dominant force. There's a cycle now of outside leg dominance that exposes my training partner's heel.

(37:11 - 37:29)
The critical mistake that most people made is that when they came to use their legs, they retained outside leg dominance when it was time to break people. And that was a terrible, terrible mistake. When my outside leg is dominant, it's pushing my opponent in the same direction as the escape.

(37:30 - 37:57)
And it means that when I go to apply the breaking force on the heel hook, my outside leg is alleviating pressure. As I try to turn my opponent's heel to the right, my outside leg is pushing in the same direction to my opponent's right, to my left. When I go to apply pressure, my dominant outside leg is actually assisting Kyle Masaru in the direction of his escape and making his job easier.

(37:58 - 38:14)
In addition, when I go to apply breaking force on the heel, my outside leg is actually pushing him in the same direction that I'm trying to apply breaking pressure. It's relieving pressure on my opponent's ankle. And that's why for so long, so many people attended heel hooks without results.

(38:15 - 38:29)
You have to learn to cycle inside leg and outside leg depending upon what you're trying to do. Yes, when I want to expose my opponent's heel, I need to be outside leg dominant. That's what exposes my training partner's heel.

(38:31 - 38:49)
When I go to follow my opponent's turn, yes, I should be outside leg dominant. But when I come over on the other side, it's all about the inside leg. The inside leg is now dominant and it pushes down on my training partner's knee in such a way that can affect the break.

(38:50 - 39:15)
Okay. Anytime I go to break my training partner's leg with a heel hook in the straight-out shigurami system, subsystem, my inside leg does the work of pushing in one direction against the work of my heel hook going in the opposite direction. This is a point so important that I'm going to spend some time on this right now.

(39:15 - 39:23)
Here's my inside leg. Here's my outside leg. We have the heel hook in place.

(39:23 - 39:40)
My inside leg must push to my right while my arms torque his ankle to my left. Only in this way can I exert a true breaking force on my opponent's legs. Watch my inside leg.

(39:41 - 39:51)
Okay. I take my inside leg and I dominate my opponent's knee with the inside leg. I push down on the knee.

(39:51 - 40:08)
If there's no push down on the knee and my legs are straight, then it's just my arms cranking to my left. There's some power, but nothing crazy. The moment my inside leg starts pushing down on the knee while I torque in the opposite direction with my arms, you're getting breaking force.

(40:09 - 40:24)
This is why it's easy for me to exert breaking force even with one hand. Okay. The inside knee pushes Kawamasaro's knee out to my right while my hand torques his ankle to my left.

(40:24 - 40:43)
In this way, you get a genuine rotating force on his lower leg from knee to ankle where his upper leg is going to the right and his lower leg is going to the left. In this way, we get true breaking pressure. So I have to learn in any heel hook cycle to cycle outside leg dominance with inside leg dominance.

(40:43 - 40:57)
So coming through from a basic ashi garami, look out now. I'm outside leg dominant. How do I know that? Because my knees are showing which direction we're pushing in.

(40:57 - 41:14)
My inside leg has come over and is pushing in this direction. As we go to applying force, everything switches with the outside ashi garami. Now my inside leg, you can clearly see my knees went from pointing to my left, they're now pointing to my right.

(41:15 - 41:34)
And as a result, pressure down with my left knee creates breaking pressure. So my left knee comes towards my right knee and the break is on. We've been looking at the straight ashi garami system.

(41:34 - 41:51)
We've seen that essentially it's composed of four distinct steps. Within that system, there are four distinct ashi garamis for each one of those steps. The idea is that we strongly distinguish between the mechanism of control, the ashi garami, and the mechanism of breaking the heel hook.

(41:51 - 42:07)
In this case, the outside heel hook. We've seen that our first step is always entry and connection. We use a ribby ashi garami as our method of entering our training partner's legs and forming a connection that puts my opponent's knee inside my knee line.

(42:07 - 42:28)
We've seen from here, my primary interest is in forming that connection and maintaining it against resistance. Once I see I've got an initial control of my opponent, it's time to go to the second phase of the system and that's to generate exposure of my opponent's heel. We've seen that a ribby ashi garami is not very appropriate for this task.

(42:28 - 42:49)
It's okay, you can do it against a beginner, but at highest levels, it's risky for me to start pitching down to a shoulder and exposing my own heel to my opponent as I'm digging for hits. So a better approach is to switch to another form of ashi garami. We chose inside ashi garami where I take my foot across the centre line and expose my opponent's heel.

(42:50 - 43:11)
From here, we get an initial grip, a false grip on our training partner like so. As a result, we now have the heel under our control and we're ready to go into the third stage of the system which is to negate my opponent's attempt at escape. I know what his three attempts are, they're always the same.

(43:11 - 43:35)
He can either break the structure of my ashi garami, he can rotate faster than I can rotate, or he can extract his knee from my knee line and play essentially a distance game. I can shut down all three of those by quickly locking a senkaku so that when he tries to peel my legs apart, one leg is reinforced by the other. I've got a closed system of wedges around both of his hips.

(43:35 - 43:58)
It's difficult for him to go after my heels because I've already got a grip on him while he has none on me. Okay, from here, I go to apply pressure on my training partner's heel that forces him into a roll. I know now he's going to go into the second phase of escape which is to try and use his foot on my buttocks and from here, push and get his knee free from my knee line.

(43:59 - 44:27)
But by pointing my knee down to the floor, even with no hands, the kakusai goes to run away from me so I never pull free. Once my knee goes down to the floor, this last thing is to try and back-step over the top but that leads right into the final phase, the outside ashi-gurami. We've seen from here a theory of breaking which involves legs, inside leg, dominating my opponent's knee.

(44:28 - 44:49)
Variations in hand grip, each one getting progressively tighter than the next. The idea of opposing forces, my ashi-gurami pointing in one direction and my heel hook going in the other. The idea of opposing forces on the foot itself, every heel hook is composed of a push on the toes and a pull on the heel.

(44:50 - 45:26)
We've seen that we put our opponent's toe line into the bicep, we put our wrist below the ankle and everything begins with a push on the toes and a pull on the heel. This leads to the concept of follow-through where even with no hands, I can generate tremendous pressure on my training partner by following through the breaking point. Once we work in this way, you see it's a fairly simple system and it can be done under stress against a wide variety of opponents in a very short period of time.

(45:27 - 45:49)
So for example, if I have someone in my butterfly guard, it's not a difficult thing for me in these circumstances to start lifting, elevating, popping over into an initial entry. From here, it's not a difficult thing. What I'll do with my training partner will come up and in a matter of seconds, we've got a very strong breaking position down the mat with an outside ashigurami.

(45:49 - 46:25)
It seems like a lot, four steps, four different ashiguramis, but really it all happens in a matter of seconds. A very useful way to teach, for me to teach you and for you to teach yourself the art of heel hooking in straight ashigurami scenarios is to look at the primary problem that you're trying to overcome. A big part of the way I teach you is to identify what's the main problem in any given scenario that you're trying to overcome in order to get to your goal.

(46:27 - 46:49)
The great problem associated with straight ashigurami attacks is always the problem of the shared spiral. An obvious question, what the hell is the problem of the shared spiral? Let's have a look at that right now. A heel hook of course is a twisting or spiralling form of lock.

(46:49 - 47:02)
There are some locks that are linear, so for example an amba, judogitami is a linear lock. Everything goes in a straight line. A heel hook like a kimura or a figure four toehold is a twisting lock, is a spiral of forces.

(47:04 - 47:25)
Whenever I go into a heel hook position, the force of my heel hook is followed by my opponent's escape route. They're exactly the same. So the problem is for most people there's a danger that as I go to spiral into the lock, he will spiral in the same direction to escape.

(47:25 - 47:38)
So we share the same spiral. And so you often get situations, you'll see this in competition all the time, where people just roll and roll and roll and they're both sharing the same spiral and nothing gets done. There's no result.

(47:38 - 47:55)
They just go out of bounds and get reset. I can never tolerate this. The problem with the shared spiral is how am I going to stop or curtail that spiralling process.

(47:55 - 48:17)
Yes, if my heel hook goes from right to left and my opponent's escape also goes from my right to my left, that's a potential problem. How do I overcome it? A large part of it has to do with the idea of cycling inside and outside leg dominance. We want to finish in an outside ashigurami to stop the cycle of the shared spiral.

(48:18 - 48:51)
If I retain the same ashigurami on my opponent as we go into work, my knees are pointing in the same direction as his knees. And as a result, we just keep on rolling together without result. But if I take my legs to an outside ashigurami position so that my knees are pointing across my training partner's knees or in extreme examples, even down towards the floor, as my opponent goes to continue the cycle of rolling, he'll break his own leg on my ashigurami.

(48:51 - 49:13)
I don't have to do a damn thing. So if my body is locked in this direction to my right hand side and Kawabusara goes to turn to my left, he'll break his own knee. There are some common errors made by many beginning students which will exasperate and make worse the problem of the shared spiral.

(49:13 - 49:39)
Let's look at the number one, which I always see when I go to teach heel hooking, which I want you to make sure you don't make this mistake. Probably the single most common mistake I see is people rolling over an elbow. When I go into a heel hook situation, I know I want to roll in this direction to ultimately end up in my outside heel hook, my outside ashigurami.

(49:39 - 49:59)
A very common mistake which you will see is people prop on an elbow. When they come up, they go to turn, they prop up on an elbow. This is a disaster because my own elbow will slow my rate of rotation so that when I go to follow Kawabusara's rotation, I go slower to him and he's gone.

(50:01 - 50:17)
Never when we go to roll do I prop myself on an elbow. I always lock my hands to my ribs and I roll smoothly over a shoulder. When I try to roll over an elbow, my elbow stops me and you feel very awkward.

(50:17 - 50:29)
You slow down, he keeps the same speed. If he's rotating faster than me, he will escape. I need to be able to rotate at the same speed he's rotating, which means rolling easily over my shoulders.

(50:29 - 50:39)
So let's look at an incorrect roll and a correct roll together. Here, I successfully employed the lock. Unfortunately, I've made a terrible mistake.

(50:39 - 50:58)
I've unlocked my hands and as Kawabusara goes to roll, I try to prop myself on my elbow, he rotated faster than me and easily escaped. Avoid this mistake. When we go to roll, always, once we lock up in this position, I roll over my shoulders.

(50:58 - 51:11)
Kawabusara, roll as fast as you can. So we're always in the right place. Now, we've created a situation where he goes to roll a second time he'll break his own leg.

(51:12 - 51:42)
Okay, because my Ashigurami is pointing against his roll as opposed to here pointing the same direction. Now, at the start of this DVD, we talked about the idea of reinforcing wedges. We saw that in the case of Ashigurami, I have to reinforce my wedges by locking my legs.

(51:42 - 52:09)
Either crossing my feet or locking triangles or Senkakus around my opponent's legs because body weight isn't a big part of the Ashigurami game. That was an oversimplification that I had to give to you to first get you around the idea of reinforcing wedges. But there is a way to bring in weight as a means of reinforcing wedges in Ashigurami and it pays big dividends when it's time to break someone's leg.

(52:09 - 52:41)
This is the idea of utilising the weight of my hips to reinforce the breaking power of my legs. From an outside Ashigurami situation, if my hips stay on the floor when I go to break my training partner's legs, it will put a cap or a ceiling on how far or how much pressure I can apply to my opponent's legs. When I go to break my opponent, I bring my knees down and the last component is for me to take my hips off the floor.

(52:42 - 53:06)
So I can get tremendous weight onto the top of my opponent's leg. If my hips are on the mat and I just pull up, it puts a limit on how much torque and how much follow-through I can get on my training partner's legs. When it's time to break, I lift my hips on top of my training partner's knees so that the bony hard fulcrum of my hips goes directly into the inside of his knee.

(53:06 - 53:18)
Now, I look down at the floor and I lift up in a straight line. So as my head rises, the yashi gurami pushes down. In this way, I've got weight down on the leg.

(53:18 - 53:29)
The only part of my body on the floor when I finish is my feet and my elbow. Everything else is off the mat. If my hips are on the floor, my weight gets transmitted to the floor.

(53:29 - 53:45)
When my hips come off the floor, my weight gets transmitted to my opponent's knee so that when I lift up on the heel, we get genuine breaking pressure. The same is true as my back is flat on the mat. As Kamasara goes to escape from the log, from here, I push down with my feet.

(53:46 - 53:57)
Because my hips are on the floor, it's putting a cap on how much power I can generate. But the moment my hips come off the mat, we get genuine breaking power. I cannot emphasise this enough.

(53:57 - 54:11)
When it's time to break, get your hips off the mat. Whether we're down on an elbow, like so, hips off the mat, breaking. Or whether we're flat on our back, hips off the mat, and breaking.

(54:12 - 54:18)
This will greatly amplify your breaking potential in any straight or outside Ashigurami situation.


## Volume 5

(0:03 - 0:21)
We've been looking at the Leglock system. We've seen that there's a general system composed of six essential skills arranged in a sequence. We've seen within that general system there's three distinct subsystems, each of which is significantly different from the other and has to be treated as a distinct entity.

(0:22 - 0:44)
We looked at the straight Ashigurami system and saw that it was composed mainly around the idea of multiple Ashiguramis for multiple tasks. There were four distinct tasks of, if you're looking for that position, four distinct Ashiguramis required to fulfil those tasks and a central problem to overcome. The central problem is the idea of shared spirals.

(0:44 - 1:22)
Now we're going to switch to the second and one of the more well-known parts of the Leglock system, which is the subsystem known as Cross Ashigurami. Cross Ashigurami represents an important element of the Leglock system overall and for the development of the Leglock system. You all know that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is based around the notion of hierarchy, that there are certain movements, pins in the sport, which are rated more highly than others.

(1:22 - 1:43)
And this is reflected in the point system. So, for example, knee on belly gets a certain number of points, mounted position gets more, rear mounted position gets more. Certain positions are valued more highly because they offer, if we were in a real fight situation, a greater ability to control my opponent in ways where I could strike him on the ground.

(1:45 - 2:06)
The Leglock system also is hierarchical in exactly the same fashion, only now we're not concerned with punching people on the ground, we're concerned with a different set of criteria. When I go to judge the worth of a Lock and an Ashigurami, there's two main things that I concern myself with. The first is safety.

(2:07 - 2:26)
Whenever I go into any form of Ashigurami, regardless of type, I can't do it without exposing my own feet to my opponent. So, if I get lackadaisical with my foot position, I may well be finished myself here with an inverted heel hook. If I get lackadaisical with my foot position here, I can be finished in toe holds.

(2:28 - 2:58)
Anytime I go into an Ashigurami, my own feet are exposed to my opponent, just as his feet are exposed to mine. The question is always, what degree of exposure is there? Certain kinds of Ashigurami result in greater degrees of foot exposure. So, for example, a 50-50 type situation can often result in undesirable exposure of my own feet to my opponent's feet, depending upon my skill level and his skill level.

(2:59 - 3:37)
As a general rule, I rate an Ashigurami higher or lower, depending upon two things. How much are my feet exposed to danger from my opponent's counters? And what is the breaking potential of the locks employed from that Ashigurami? In the case of cross Ashigurami, it can be very risky for me to put my feet into situations where we both have more or less the same lock upon each other. I can definitely break my opponent from this position, but he can also definitely break me if his skill level is good.

(3:38 - 4:11)
In general, I like to work from situations where there is minimal exposure of my feet to him, while there is maximal exposure of his feet to me. As a result, of all the various Ashiguramis that I work with, the one which is the highest, the apex of the hierarchy, is a cross Ashigurami, where my feet are positioned on the inside of my opponent's legs. This minimises the exposure of my feet to my opponent, and it maximises my ability to go in and break my opponent.

(4:14 - 4:33)
It's no secret that probably the most devastating breaks in the sport of Judo-su come from inside heel hooks. In top-level competition, they have been probably the number one method in the entire leg-locking game for getting submissions in high-level competition. There is a reason for this.

(4:34 - 4:58)
Mechanically, when I go in to attack my opponent's legs in situations from a cross Ashigurami, the target of my attack is the inside of my opponent's knee, the medial ligaments. In addition, the distance through which I have to move in order to break my opponent's leg is extremely small. So, the target of the attack is a significant one.

(4:58 - 5:13)
If I tear my opponent's MCL, it's hard, difficult for my opponent to keep on fighting. And the distance that's required in order for me to enact the break is extremely small. And there's a third consideration.

(5:14 - 5:29)
In a cross Ashigurami, both of my opponent's feet and legs are in front of me. Contrast this with a straight Ashigurami. Now, only one of my opponent's legs is in front of me.

(5:29 - 5:48)
The other is behind. I can't access both of my opponent's legs at the same time. In addition, when I go to apply breaking pressure on my opponent, the force of my break is mostly transmitted into the LCL, the outside of my opponent's knee, and to a lesser degree, the ankle.

(5:49 - 6:06)
These are strong and powerful breaks, but they are not the same as taking the MCL as you would with an inside heel hook. Your opponent can go on to fight in many cases, even with a severe tear of the LCL. But it's extremely difficult for him to do so with a complete tear of the MCL.

(6:08 - 6:37)
In addition, the range of motion through which I have to move is typically greater in the case of straight or outside heel hooks than it is in the case of cross Ashigurami inside heel hooks. So, for reasons like this, my preferred position for breaking is always a cross Ashigurami inside heel hook with my feet to the inside. We're going to be seeing soon that there are many varieties of foot position on the inside.

(6:38 - 6:47)
I can head my feet foot over foot, like so. I can lock a triangle with my legs. The so-called inside Senkaku.

(6:48 - 7:22)
I can also take my foot from one kind of Senkaku, my foot in the middle of my opponent, to my foot around on the other side, so that I have wedges on both sides of my opponent's legs. This is a very, very strong form of block. A method which my student Eddie Cummings specialised in was the use of the shoelaces as a strong wedge to push him against his opponent's hip.

(7:23 - 7:41)
That was something that he certainly used with a lot of effect in competition. I won't teach that, since that was Eddie Cummings' innovation, not mine. But I will teach the various other forms of inside Senkaku, which my students have used with tremendous success in competition.

(7:42 - 8:04)
Let's start off with a very important distinction, which becomes crucial in your understanding of the cross-Ashigurami position. This is the distinction between a primary and a secondary leg. In any situation where I have an Ashigurami, regardless of cross or straight, there's always a primary leg.

(8:04 - 8:17)
That's the leg held by the Ashigurami. So if I have my Ashigurami around Bernardo's left leg, the left leg is the primary leg. The other leg is the secondary leg.

(8:19 - 8:37)
Almost all of my opponent's escapes to any given Ashigurami originate with the secondary leg. So, for example, Bernardo could take his foot and pommel it inside my shin. Pommel through and around and threaten me.

(8:38 - 9:01)
The escape started with this leg, the secondary leg. The beauty of the cross-Ashigurami position is that it puts both the primary and the secondary leg directly in front of me, where I can access both at the same time. This is not true in the case of the straight Ashiguramis that we looked at previously.

(9:01 - 9:17)
Here, the primary leg is in front of me, but the secondary leg is behind me. As a result, my opponent can go into a lot of strong defensive movements based on the movements of this leg. That all starts to change when we go cross-Ashi.

(9:18 - 9:44)
From a cross-Ashi system, both the primary leg, the one held by my Ashigurami, and the secondary leg are right there in front of me. I can access both of them very, very easily. This leads us into a very special form of Ashigurami that my students often make use of, the ankle-lace Ashigurami, where they seize the secondary leg and hold it with an Achilles lock, just like so.

(9:45 - 10:02)
From a position like this, my opponent's legs are laced together, in the same way that you would manacle a prisoner by handcuffing his ankles together. When my opponent goes to move, it's so difficult for him to generate any kind of effective movement. He's more or less held in place.

(10:02 - 10:24)
This is essentially a form of pin without body weight. Whenever we go into this position, we can hold people for long periods of time, and then control the timing of the break. So when we're in the cross-Ashigurami position, one of our favourite methods of working is to get a hold of our opponent's secondary leg and lace the ankles.

(10:25 - 10:54)
This laced leg Ashigurami is a big, big part of the cross-Ashigurami system, and we'll be spending a lot of time in that area. In fact, it'll be the first part of our focus. We've seen that the leg-lock system is really an amalgamation of three, very separate, and yet linked, subsystems.

(10:55 - 11:17)
The straight Ashigurami system, the cross-Ashigurami system, and the reverse Ashigurami system. Let's look now at the cross-Ashigurami system, and start to understand some of the similarities and differences between it and other systems that we work with. A classy dog is sitting in front of me, and his leg goes across my centre line.

(11:17 - 11:27)
His right leg across my right hip. This will be, obviously, a cross-Ashigurami situation. As a general rule, we like to work with our feet inside our training partner's legs.

(11:27 - 11:56)
It is possible in situations like this to work with your feet on the outside, but now there's increasing vulnerability on my part from my opponent's attacks, and a general lessening in control, and an ability to switch off into other options that we want to avoid. So, as a general rule, we much prefer to have our feet in the inside position, just like so. Now, you guys are familiar with some of the concepts we work with with regards to the straight Ashigurami system.

(11:56 - 12:08)
Let's look at some obvious similarities between straight Ashigurami and cross-Ashigurami. One thing that doesn't change is the notion of knee and knee line. Regardless of what kind of heel hook I'm going to attempt, one thing always remains unchanged.

(12:09 - 12:25)
I have to keep my opponent's knee inside my knee line. We're defining the knee line as a straight line that joins my left and right knee, and Placido's knee must remain within that line. So, a very important thing in situations like this is to be able to maintain that knee line relationship.

(12:26 - 12:51)
One of our favourite ways to work in this situation is to control the secondary leg, like so. If I see Placido begin to move out of this position, I will take my arm and I will put an extra wedge underneath my training partner's primary leg and lock in, just like so. When he tries to shuffle out now, that extra wedge means that at any given moment, I can always bring his knee back inside my knee line and lock up more securely.

(12:51 - 13:13)
So, if you're in this situation, the cross Ashigurami, and you feel your opponent is doing a good job of slipping his knee, and you feel distances increasing between you, this is the time to take your arm, go elbow deep around your training partner's knee to put that extra wedge in. So, when he tries to go further out, it's very, very difficult. And now I can use that extra wedge to draw him back inside my knee line and go back into work.

(13:14 - 13:35)
So, this obviously is a similarity with the previous Ashiguramis that we looked at in a straight Ashigurami system. Nonetheless, there are also some very important differences. One of the more noticeable differences, when we get into a cross Ashigurami situation, is that for the first time, we now have two legs in front of us.

(13:35 - 14:17)
In a straight Ashigurami situation, we always have, regardless of the Ashigurami, one leg in front of us, and one leg behind us. All that changes in a cross Ashigurami situation, where now, for the first time, we have two legs in front. There's going to be many advantages to that.

This is one reason why we strongly favour this position. We also find the nature of the heel hook itself, the inside heel hook, is substantially different. In an inside heel hook, the primary stress on my training partner's body when I go into a heel hook is going to be on the MCL, as opposed to a straight Ashigurami system, where the primary stress is on the LCL, on the outside of the leg.

(14:17 - 14:33)
So we tend to get slightly more catastrophic breaks on our opponent's leg. So in heated situations, where you need to maximise breaking power, we generally have a preference for inside heel hooks out of a cross Ashigurami. So you see there's some similarities, some differences, when we go to this position.

(14:38 - 14:54)
We're looking at the cross Ashigurami system. Let's add in some preliminary thoughts that will be very, very important as we go through this video. We said earlier that when we work in a cross Ashigurami situation, we've got two legs in front of us.

(14:54 - 15:05)
Let's make a very, very important distinction between a primary and a secondary leg. Let's define the primary leg as the leg which is actually held by my Ashigurami. That's the one that's caught between my two legs.

(15:06 - 15:27)
We call it the primary leg because ultimately what we want to do is we want to get to the strongest heel hook in the entire sport of Jiu-Jitsu, which is the inside heel hook. Ultimately, we're looking to get to this grip. However, we have to understand that around 90% of my opponent's escape potential comes from his secondary leg.

(15:27 - 15:45)
That's what's going to enable him to pull his foot inside my feet, and then from here go into attack knee with counters. That's what's going to enable him to start turning and spinning in this direction to get away from my Ashigurami. Most of his escape potential comes from the secondary leg, whereas most of my submission potential comes on the primary leg.

(15:46 - 15:59)
When we get into this position, the primary leg is the one we're going to be attacking. The secondary leg is the one we typically use to bind up to get control over a difficult, unmanageable opponent. Let's always keep that in mind as we work.

(15:59 - 16:26)
When we talk about a primary leg, that's the one that's held inside our Ashigurami, and the secondary leg is the other leg, which usually generates most of our opponent's escape potential. We're looking at the cross Ashigurami subsystem within the general leg lock system. I'm going to talk now about a very, very important distinction in how we go to operate in this position.

(16:27 - 16:42)
There's a basic split in two methods that I can work out of any cross Ashigurami situation. I would like it very much if we're being proficient at both. I do have a preference, but that doesn't mean that you should only specialise in one or the other.

(16:44 - 16:54)
There are absolutely going to be times where you have to work with the other option, even if you have a preferred option. It very much pays to be proficient in both. Let's have a look at the distinction.

(16:55 - 17:14)
Whenever I work in a cross Ashigurami system, we've seen there's two legs in front of us. How I go to operate in this situation will come down to two fundamental choices. Will I work attacking both of my opponent's legs, or will I work with one leg? Single leg versus double leg options, essentially.

(17:15 - 17:24)
My preference is always to control both legs. I like the control that comes with this. I like the fact that I can slow the match down and limit my training partner's movements.

(17:25 - 17:37)
But I would be a liar if I said to you, you're always going to be able to get two legs. You're going to have many opponents who do a good job of splitting their legs and starting moving away. Now I have to work with one leg, and I should still be able to be successful under those circumstances.

(17:39 - 17:57)
We're going to coach this position as though there were a split between those two options. Because how I go to operate is entirely dependent on which of those two options is open to me. I'm going to coach first my preference, which is to work with the principle of double trouble and lock up both of my opponent's legs.

(17:58 - 18:18)
Then we're going to come back later to the idea of working with a single leg and still be able to get to a successful submission without the use of the second leg. But our first line of direction in investigating the cross-archer throwing position is going to be to work with two legs, the double leg scenario. Working with double trouble, where we bind up our training partner's legs like so.

(18:19 - 18:40)
Then later on, we'll come back to the single leg situation with the other leg. The secondary leg is too far away from me, and now I have to go to work on one leg to get the submission. You guys know that a central tenet of my teaching philosophy in Jiu-Jitsu is what we call central problem theory.

(18:40 - 19:09)
That for any given scenario or position in the sport of Jiu-Jitsu, regardless of what it is, there's always at least one central problem that motivates both me as the person performing the action and my opponent as the person resisting the action. If you show me any given position or scenario in the sport of Jiu-Jitsu, I can always identify at least one central problem that will motivate the actions of the two athletes. Let's look at how this occurs in the case of cross-archery running.

(19:10 - 19:38)
Whenever we're here, the fundamental problem that we face in this situation is what I refer to as the turnout problem. Let's see how the turnout problem materialises and how it drives the action in a given direction once the athletes get into this position. If my opponent were naive and he turned into me, that would be a terrible mistake on his part, because essentially what he's done is he's exposed his own heel to my inside heel hook.

(19:40 - 20:04)
Here, Placido starts in a neutral position, but by turning into me, he's clearly exposed the heel without me having to do any work. Even if he high-legged over and stepped over, it would not help, because his high leg will never beat the power of a closed wedge inside Senkaku. I can return him to the mat, into the heel hook, or if he's so physically strong that he maintains his position, I'll just break him right here.

(20:05 - 20:30)
Even his entire moving body weight won't break the strength of my Senkaku around his leg, so that would be a terrible mistake on his part. Another common mistake is people will move backwards in straight lines. You know what they're trying to do.

It's not a bad idea on their part. They're trying to take their knee outside of my knee line, but I have a closed wedge around their legs. When he moves back, it's so easy for me just to stay stuck to him.

(20:30 - 20:58)
As he moves back, he's doing nothing to hide his heel, and as a result, we can easily go in and get the break. So movements straight backwards are ineffective. Movements into me are worse than ineffective.

They're actually positively hazardous. So what's the right thing for him to do? It's always to begin an action of turning out in this direction. Even if I had a heel hook coming back, Placido, he would fight my hands, split my hands, slip his heel, and then begin to turn out.

(20:59 - 21:05)
Once Placido engages in a turn out, interesting things start to happen. Let's look at the first. Come back.

(21:05 - 21:23)
From here, as long as my head is inside my training partner's legs, I can access the heel. The moment my head goes outside his legs, it's very, very difficult for me now to start accessing the heel. By turning in this direction, that's exactly what Placido is doing.

(21:23 - 21:43)
He's putting my head outside of his legs, and as a result, it's getting harder and harder for me to access his heel. The only way I can try is to try and come down to an elbow, and that unweights my leg. It makes me very vulnerable to a simple thumb post, and now Placido can easily slip his legs out, and not only escape, he can actually start countering me in this position.

(21:44 - 21:51)
Now I can end up in my own cross-archery ground. I don't have to fight my way out of that. So this is always the problem associated with the turn out escape.

(21:53 - 22:15)
Whenever someone goes to turn away from me, it does a good job of first hiding the heel, and then unweighting one of my major archery ground legs, the outside leg, and from here, it's an easy knee slip, I've no longer controlled the knee line, and he's gone. The heel is lost. So the smart thing for him to do, whether I have the heel or not, is always to turn out in this direction.

(22:15 - 22:40)
That simple insight will motivate both his actions and my actions in this position. Everything we do in the cross-archery ground position, and everything you will do as a student, will be motivated and given direction by this simple insight. The whole cross-archery ground system which I teach is essentially a response to this one central problem.

(22:41 - 23:03)
We will soon see that the central problem, the turn out problem, creates spin-off problems, which we will have to confront as we go further into the system. But whether I choose to work with a single leg, or whether I choose to work with a double leg, is essentially a response to this problem. How I go to act will be an attempt to overcome this turn out problem.

(23:08 - 23:21)
We're looking at the cross-archery ground system. Let's get further into it now. In a situation where I'm locked up with Placido and a cross-archery ground, we've seen there's a central problem that we're always trying to overcome, the turn out problem.

(23:22 - 23:36)
My personal favourite response to the turn out problem always comes back to the principle of double trouble. I know in order to turn out his secondary leg, the knee must go away from me and point away. It has to happen.

(23:37 - 23:52)
So my number one thing that I favour above all others is to go into a different form of Ashigurami and seize my opponent's secondary leg. You will often see my students make use of this principle. All of them do it extremely well, and all of them have had tremendous success with it.

(23:53 - 24:27)
The first issue that I face here is not the issue of breaking my opponent. It's of controlling his movement. His movement is designed to get him away, turning out in this direction, and I've got to do something to address that.

I have to address this. I can't go fishing for a heel hook when the question of movement and control hasn't been resolved yet. This is not the time for heel hooking.

This is the time for stopping movement. As soon as I get into a position like this and I see any kind of movement away, my number one thing is to straighten my leg and get a two-on-one grip and snatch my opponent, one above the knee and one below the knee. Now let's be very careful how we grip here.

(24:28 - 24:38)
Do not go in superficially with your fingers. I need to go wrist-deep around my opponent's leg. That means both of my wrists have to bend at least 90 degrees.

(24:39 - 24:48)
I'm looking not to grip the leg. I'm looking to grip the knee tendon underneath here. I want to take four fingers and lock in here.

(24:49 - 24:59)
Four fingers here. Once again, as he goes to turn away, I reach and grip. Once I get my grip, I draw everything back and lock it up with an Achilles hold here.

(24:59 - 25:04)
I'm not trying to put any heat on his leg at this point. I'm not trying to hurt him with this look. I just hold him in place.

(25:05 - 25:12)
When he goes to turn in this direction, only the upper body can turn. I don't care about the upper body in this situation. I care about the lower body.

(25:12 - 25:19)
His upper body can turn here, absolutely. But the part that counts isn't turning anywhere. He won't be able to complete a turnout.

(25:20 - 25:34)
I can hold someone here for long periods of time. We've seen even if you lose the knee line in this situation, you can recover it here very, very easily by putting an extra wedge in and drawing him back. If I want my opponent to move in any given direction, I can do it.

(25:34 - 25:44)
If I want him to fall this way, it's an easy thing to make him do. If I want my opponent to roll over in this direction, it's an easy thing for me to accomplish. I control someone here at this point.

(25:46 - 26:02)
This is absolutely one of the most controlling positions that I know of in the sport of Jiu-Jitsu. I have the same amount of control over someone here as I would in the mounted position or the rear mounted position. I completely control the direction and capacity for movement that my opponent has.

(26:03 - 26:14)
You can see what's behind this. Essentially what you've done is you've shackled your training partner's two ankles together. It's like if you want to control an unruly prisoner, what's a great thing to do is to handcuff his two ankles together.

(26:15 - 26:19)
He's not going to run away at all. He's completely controlled. That's essentially what I've done here.

(26:19 - 26:43)
Whatever athleticism my opponent has is destroyed by the fact that his two ankles are shackled together by this grip. Essentially my response, my favourite response I should say, to the turn out problem is to make a switch to a new form of Ashigurami. I had a basic bare bones cross Ashigurami and I went across and I took a lace leg or ankle lace Ashigurami.

(26:44 - 27:02)
Where I took a hold of my training partner's leg and laced his two ankles together. The moment I get to this position, I know I control my opponent's movement in a way which no other Ashigurami can do. We've seen that there's a fundamental problem here, a central problem, the turn out problem.

(27:02 - 27:13)
We've seen my favourite response to that is to switch to a new form of Ashigurami, the ankle lace Ashigurami. Which more or less prevents a turn out. Now we know something here.

(27:14 - 27:32)
Ultimately we want to push ourselves to the top of the breaking hierarchy. And we know the top of the hierarchy for breaking and leg locking is this, the inside heel hook. As good as the ankle lace Ashigurami is for controlling people, there's an obvious problem here.

(27:32 - 27:44)
If I hold on to the secondary leg, how am I going to heel hook the primary leg? At some point I've got to release this leg. And that's when things start getting interesting. Now we get a new derivative problem.

(27:45 - 28:00)
The central problem we faced was always the turn out problem. We solved that by switching to a new form of Ashigurami, the lace leg or ankle lace Ashigurami. At some point if I want to heel hook this man, I have to release the secondary leg.

(28:01 - 28:11)
The moment I go to release the secondary leg, the whole turn out problem emerges anew. And now there's a race to get to the heel. I often refer to this as the release problem.

(28:12 - 28:19)
When I go to release my opponent's leg, the turn out problem re-emerges. So here I've stopped the turn out. Now I want to get my heel hook.

(28:19 - 28:31)
I release and it's gone again. Learning to overcome the release problem is one of the keys to success to this position. And it's something you will have to become highly proficient at.

(28:31 - 28:50)
We're going to look now in considerable detail at how we manage the release of the secondary leg and get through to a successful submission. So this is exactly what I'm looking for. Now we've been looking at the idea of a cross Ashigurami position.

(28:50 - 29:07)
We've seen there's a central problem, a turn out problem. And we've seen our first method of managing the turn out problem or overcoming it is to lock up, switch to a new form of Ashigurami and lock up our opponent's secondary leg and prevent him from turning out. But this creates a new problem, a follow up problem as it were.

(29:08 - 29:21)
The release problem. When I go to perform a heel hook I have to release my opponent's secondary leg and then he can turn out again. So we're going to look now at managing the release of our opponent's secondary leg so we can get through to some successful breaks.

(29:21 - 29:32)
The first recommendation I'm going to give you, the first method of overcoming the release problem is don't release the leg. Just don't. There's ways to attack your opponent's legs that don't require you to release it.

(29:32 - 29:54)
Let's look at some of those right now. Once I get a hold of my training partner's leg in this position one excellent way for me to operate is to perform a very strong version of the Achilles lock on my training partner's secondary leg at the ankle. So from here I'm going to lift my training partner's secondary leg and I'm going to pass my arm inside and underneath my right arm.

(29:55 - 30:09)
Do not put your free forearm in front. Rather go through underneath and behind. As a result, my thumb is very, very close to my training partner's ankle where it should be for any good Achilles lock.

(30:09 - 30:33)
I don't want my thumb halfway down the shin where you're going to have a very poor breaking potential. I want to make sure that as my second or free hand comes in that lock is right there underneath my training partner's ankle. That means that when I lock a reverse figure four grip on my training partner we're right down where we can put extreme pressure on our training partner's anterior tibialis tendon on the front of the ankle.

(30:33 - 30:52)
From here I'm going to lock up on my training partner and point my elbow, in this case my right elbow, in towards his hips. Do not just go back in this direction and split the legs. I want to bring one leg down on top of the other and as a result we can put tremendous breaking pressure through this Achilles lock.

(30:53 - 31:05)
It's very, very intimidating for my opponent. His only real recourse to this situation is to go forward and fight my hands. The moment I see someone engage in the hand fight, I just turn my wrists.

(31:06 - 31:18)
He thinks, hey, I'm going to get my leg out. The secondary leg starts to pop out and it leads me right into the second horn of the dilemma. It's such a short transition into the inside yoke that you're almost guaranteed to get it.

(31:18 - 31:27)
Let's have a look at that again. We start off, cross ashigurami situation. We transfer it into an ankle lace ashigurami to prevent the turnout.

(31:27 - 31:47)
From this situation, I feel if I'm going to release the secondary leg, he's going to quickly spin out and escape. I'm going to go with a strategy of simply not releasing the leg. The key is that I feed my free hand inside and underneath so that when it emerges, it's below my training partner's ankle.

(31:47 - 32:09)
Do not have your thumb above the ankle. The whole key is to come in here below so that when I lock my figure four grip, it's going to be operating right and putting tremendous tension on the anterior tibialis tendon as opposed to just generic pain or discomfort on my opponent's foot. Now, from here, when I lock up, watch my right elbow.

(32:10 - 32:22)
My right elbow does not go across the leg. It goes pointing in towards my training partner's hips and my right shoulder goes down towards my opponent's primary foot. As a result, you get truly intimidating tension on the leg.

(32:23 - 32:41)
Your opponent will have to address this at the expense of his anterior tibialis tendon if he doesn't. As he goes forward to fight the hands, he has no capacity to turn out. As I lose one grip, I just let it go, and the distance I have to travel is so short that by the time he goes to turn out, there's just no time.

(32:41 - 32:53)
As a result, we get the break we always wanted all along. This is a classic example of the principle of dilemma in operation. I create a dilemma between my opponent's secondary ankle and the primary knee.

(32:54 - 33:01)
So here we are. We lock up. My opponent's doing a good job of putting tension in this direction, so I know if I just release the leg, he's going to be gone.

(33:02 - 33:10)
So from here, I feed the hand in, making sure I go in below the ankle. When I lock up, we get a very, very strong submission. He has to address the submission.

(33:10 - 33:26)
When I see him addressing it, he's got to go down to withdraw his foot. My ankle's so close, there's simply not time for my opponent to turn out. We're looking at the whole cross-Ashigurami position.

(33:27 - 33:52)
We've seen the central problem, the problem of turnout. We've seen that when Masato is in this position, his number one method of working in this situation is always to turn away so that he prevents his heel from being exposed to my attacks. We've seen one great way of dealing with the turnout problem is to lace up my opponent's ankles in an ankle lace Ashigurami that more or less prevents my opponent from turning out.

(33:52 - 34:06)
This creates a new problem, the release problem, that if I want to get into a heel hook, at some point I've got to release Placido's leg. From the moment I do that, now he's free to turn out a second time. So I have to learn to manage the release of this second leg in some way.

(34:06 - 34:13)
I have to have some kind of strategy for releasing this leg. The first strategy we're looking at is just don't release it. Attack the secondary leg in itself.

(34:14 - 34:31)
We just saw a reverse figure 4 lock, where I came through and locked like so. This is not the only method of locking in this position. Another one which is very, very useful is a more standardised Achilles grip, but a very different way of placing my opponent's foot to maximise damage on the anterior tibialis tendon.

(34:31 - 34:43)
As my opponent works in this position, I'm going to feed my hand through, just like so. So I have a free hand that goes through it, my training partner's knee. My second hand soars down to my opponent's ankle.

(34:44 - 34:54)
I don't want to be around here. I bring the elbow back in line with his ankle. As a result, I can shrug my hips back and at the same time thrust my elbow in front of me.

(34:55 - 35:05)
This does something very, very interesting. It places my training partner's heel right here on my rib cage. I'm going to change my position so you can see this more clearly on the camera.

(35:11 - 35:28)
Watch very clearly. The sole of Placido's heel will be placed on my floating rib. Here, I punch my hand through, I saw my hand in place, and then I place his heel right there on my floating rib.

(35:29 - 35:54)
This does something very important. A standardised counter to most forms of Achilles locks involve pushing your foot through, often referred to as putting the boot on, where Placido will push his leg through and make it very difficult for me to apply any kind of braking force to my opponent's ankle. When I place the sole of my training partner's foot on my floating rib, it makes putting on the boot or pushing through extremely difficult.

(35:55 - 36:05)
In addition, it creates some very interesting grip variations. The grip variation I'm going to demonstrate here is a variation on figure 4 grips. Here, I grab a hold of my own bicep and my own shoulder.

(36:06 - 36:26)
Now, I point my elbow at my training partner's hips and it puts direct pressure on my training partner's anterior tibialis. Again, it's a very, very painful lock, which will actually do genuine damage to your opponent, as opposed to merely cause pain. You're actually attacking an actual tendon in the leg, rather than just a generalised pain to the back of your leg.

(36:27 - 36:32)
So, once again, my opponent's in here. We have his secondary leg well bound up. I bring my arm in.

(36:33 - 36:43)
I punch my training partner's heel right there, the sole of the heel, onto my floating rib. So, when he goes to push his leg through, it's exceptionally difficult. It just runs right into my torso.

(36:43 - 37:02)
From here, I grab the bicep, my own shoulder, and I drive through into the lock. Now, having seen that detail of the heel, we're going to relocate so you can see the follow-ons that come from this move. From here, same as before, we tie up our training partner's secondary leg.

(37:03 - 37:21)
I want to stay on the leg so that my opponent can't simply turn out the moment I release it. We've seen that from here, by punching through on my training partner's leg, I can now come down to the ankle and then push the sole of his heel right onto my floating rib. Then we lock up a figure-four grip.

(37:21 - 37:32)
Ordinarily, I'm not a big fan of this grip for Achilles locks, but this particular variation works extremely well. From here, I push my elbow forward. My opponent has to fight my hands, just as before.

(37:32 - 37:55)
And just as before we created a dilemma, so too we're going to create a dilemma here. As I lose the grip and he starts pulling his foot free, like so, fighting to save himself, that's exactly when we just fall straight back, we've got a short distance to cover, and as a result, we can successfully transfer into the inside heel hook. Once again, I start off, lock in, and I get that heel into a perfect breaking position.

(37:56 - 38:00)
You'll break a lot of people in this position here. It's a difficult thing to get away from. He has to fight my hands now.

(38:01 - 38:22)
When I see him fighting the hands, look how I just pull on the outside of the heel, and even as he goes to turn out, we've got the catch, and we're in a winning position. We're looking at the cross-ashigurami position. We're looking at the response to the central problem that motivates and directs this entire position, the so-called turn-out problem.

(38:22 - 38:37)
From a situation where Placido is in a cross-ashigurami, we know the direction of his escape is always out in a way. We've seen a very good response to that is an ankle-lace-ashigurami that prevents the turn-out. Unfortunately, a new problem starts to emerge.

(38:37 - 39:09)
At some point, I've got to release the secondary leg if I want to get a heel hook on the primary leg, and that gives him a second chance for my opponent to move away from me. Another way we can stop our opponent from getting out, using the same strategy of not releasing the secondary leg, involves a double heel hook. One of my favourite things to do here is to get a wrist-deep grip around my training partner's calf muscle and start turning down on my opponent's calf, so that I start to expose the heel of the secondary leg.

(39:10 - 39:32)
From here, I'm going to take my hand, and I'm going to punch through and lock what looks like a rather weak-looking heel hook on my opponent's secondary leg. Once I get that initial bite on the heel, I'm going to lift, and we're going to go into a figure-four, reverse figure-four grip, with a heel hook on the secondary leg. That's interesting.

(39:33 - 39:50)
I put my elbow inside the primary ankle, and then I start applying a very strong outside heel hook on the secondary leg. Watch how I apply the heel hook pressure. It's a little different from normal.

(39:51 - 39:59)
Watch my right elbow as I have the reverse figure-four. I point my right elbow at my training partner's hips. I'm not lifting across my body.

(39:59 - 40:18)
Remember, I want my elbow to stay close to what I'm really thinking about all along, the ankle, the primary leg. So I push my ankle in, almost like I'm performing a figure-four toehold, but with a heel hook grip. This puts tremendous breaking pressure on my training partner.

(40:18 - 40:33)
The only way he can react to relief pressure is to turn in the direction of the heel hook, and that's a disaster, because the moment he turns that way, he's exposed what I really wanted. The inside heel hook. Now I simply clear his foot out of my path.

(40:34 - 40:44)
When he tries to go back to resist, it's done. If he tries to turn over, my inside Senkaku will always be stronger than his turnover. And we do this break in this position.

(40:45 - 40:57)
Let's have a look at this double heel hook attack again. We get a hold of our training partner's secondary leg. From here, I choose a turning action of my wrist to expose my training partner's heel.

(40:57 - 41:11)
First, I put in a conventional heel hook grip. I lift and feed to a reverse figure-four grip, much tighter. I put my elbow over Placido's primary foot.

(41:12 - 41:21)
And from here, I put tremendous breaking pressure on by pointing my elbow at his hips. That's going to force a defensive reaction. I lock the Senkaku with my legs.

(41:22 - 41:43)
I clear one heel hook and enter another. As a result, it's an easy thing for me now to make the switch into the strongest of all heel hooks, the top of the food chain, so to speak, of the leg locking game, the inside heel hook. We're looking at the cross-Ashigurami situation.

(41:43 - 42:07)
And we're looking at one of the great problems associated with it, the turnout problem. We've seen our favourite response to the turnout problem is always to tie up our opponent's secondary leg into an ankle lace Ashigurami. Once we get here, the question is always, how are you going to operate? Are you going to stay on the leg and control him forever, or are you going to make a transition to actually break the guy? When you make the transition, at some point, you're going to have to release the secondary leg.

(42:08 - 42:16)
And when that happens, now you've got the release problem. One strategy to deal with the release problem is just don't release the leg. Attack the secondary leg itself.

(42:16 - 42:33)
We've seen how to do that with various forms of Achilles locks and even heel hooks. Let's look now at a different way of operating a lace leg attack. From here, as I go to work on my training partner, I'm going to control my training partner's knee, and I'm going to punch through on our training partner's leg.

(42:35 - 42:59)
So that my arm, which is currently controlling the secondary ankle, punches between my training partner's ankles and goes elbow deep around our training partner's Achilles tendon. It is extremely important when you employ this move that your hand lines up with your opponent's toes. The further my hand from my opponent's toes, the more leverage I lose and power will bleed out of the technique.

(42:59 - 43:09)
I want my hands up here at the end of the lever. Now, from this position, I don't take this hand and bring my right to my left. Again, I'm losing position.

(43:10 - 43:24)
I want my left to come to my right, and we cross wrists and lock up. Now, my hands come to my heart. Everything goes across onto my centre line, and this puts tremendous breaking pressure through your opponent's legs.

(43:24 - 43:43)
Okay? Done properly, he will feel this as an actual knee bar attack on his primary leg. If it's not done so well, it'll still feel immensely painful to your opponent, and it's a truly intimidating lock. We will often use this to gauge the mental toughness of our training partners and opponents in competition.

(43:43 - 43:51)
It's very, very difficult for my opponent to extract himself in. Both legs are completely controlled. If he tries to turn out in this direction, it's simply not going to happen.

(43:51 - 44:03)
If he tries to spin over in this direction, that's not going to help at all. And from here, we can put tremendous breaking pressure on our training partner. Once again, we start off with an ankle lace, ashi garami.

(44:04 - 44:16)
From there, we're going to go into a lace leg break. I go through, punching in and locking up, lining my hand up with my opponent's foot. I bring my free hand to the breaking hand, not the other way around.

(44:17 - 44:28)
And from here, I bring my hands to my heart. I like to pitch over onto my side. From here, I push with both feet, and I pull one leg across the other for a punishing, punishing lock.

(44:33 - 44:44)
Now, let's go further into the cross ashi garami situation. We've looked at one strategy for dealing with the release problem, which is don't release the leg. Stay on it.

(44:44 - 45:04)
Put pain and suffering into the secondary leg, and then as our opponent reacts to that, only then do we make a switch to the primary leg and the inside heel hook. Let's go to another strategy now, where we do start intentionally releasing the leg. But we're going to release that leg under our conditions, not under his.

(45:04 - 45:22)
What does that mean? What does it say to me, I'm going to release it under my conditions? It means I'm going to release my opponent's secondary leg only when I have a hold on his heel. Remember, ultimately, this whole battle is a battle over heel exposure. I want to expose his heel, and obviously he wants the exact opposite.

(45:22 - 45:38)
The whole reason why he turns out is to hide his heel from me. What I want is this. An exposed heel with my head inside his legs, so I can go into the strongest lock in the entire leg lock system.

(45:38 - 45:54)
That's what I want, that's what he wants. Now, for me to have a control over the release of the secondary leg essentially means this. I have to have one arm at the wrist around his heel.

(45:54 - 46:15)
If I have that, absolutely, I can release my opponent's secondary leg and be very confident of a successful break. So let's start looking now at how we can do this. From a situation where I have a hold of my opponent's secondary leg, I'm going to place what we call a splitter hand in between my training partner's two legs.

(46:16 - 46:32)
I'm going to lift the secondary leg, and I'm going to place a forearm between my training partner's two legs. It functions as a splitter, splitting his two legs apart, as opposed to here where the legs are in contact with each other. So I lift and place the splitter hand in.

(46:32 - 46:45)
The moment I get the splitter hand in, I'm going to take my free arm and I'm going to go around the corner, and I'm going to lock up right here. This creates an interesting situation. This creates an interesting situation.

(46:48 - 47:06)
I have my opponent's heel. If my opponent were naive and he thought, Hey, there's nothing holding my secondary leg in place, I'll take it out and go to turn out, he'll break himself because I already have the heel in place. Let's have a look at that again.

(47:07 - 47:20)
I'm in position, I lift and I insert the splitter hand. I go through and lock up. My opponent's been telling himself this whole time, If I turn out, I'm going to be safe.

(47:21 - 47:31)
That's no longer true, because my hands are locked in the heel hook. If my opponent extracts his foot now and goes to turn out, I don't even have to do any work. His turning motion will break his leg.

(47:31 - 47:42)
And when I add my force to it, I'll double that. This is where things get interesting. We now run into the third big problem associated with cross-axial ground.

(47:42 - 48:01)
Once I get my opponent's heel locked in place like this, a new problem emerges. I often call this the interference problem or the two-foot problem. In order to break someone's leg in an inside heel hook, I must have one foot inside my armpit to get a satisfactory break.

(48:02 - 48:13)
If there are two feet inside my armpit, one foot forms a kind of interference upon the other and you never get truly satisfactory breaks. Yes, you can hurt people in this position. Yes, you can cause pain.

(48:14 - 48:25)
But at world championship level, people aren't going to tap to pain or discomfort. They're going to tap only because there's the threat of a severe break. And it's very, very hard for me to severely break someone's leg when there's two feet in my armpit.

(48:26 - 48:42)
One foot characteristically interferes with the breaking of the other. So, if I have a knowledgeable, smart opponent, someone who knows the legal game pretty well, and I put a split of hand in, and I come in here and lock, he's not going to turn out. He's going to realise that's suicide at this point.

(48:43 - 48:54)
Instead, he's going to push his foot into my armpit to amplify the interference. Okay? How do we deal with this? I'll show you right now. I'm going to pitch over onto my side.

(48:55 - 49:05)
As Placido thrusts the foot in, watch my left knee. I'm going to place my left knee just inside his knee. So, I repositioned it over his hip to the knee.

(49:06 - 49:24)
Once my knee goes inside, I can use that as a pushing force. I pitch over onto my side, and I push with my left knee into his left knee. And as a result, the secondary leg pops out like a champagne cork, but leaves the primary leg in place.

(49:25 - 49:39)
And as a result, I can fall back now and go into a very, very strong break. Okay? Essentially, what I'm doing is I'm using my legs to remove his secondary leg when I already have a heel hook in place. Okay? Don't make this common mistake.

(49:41 - 49:47)
I see this all the time. People put a split of hand in, and they push too much, too strong, and both feet come out. That's a disaster, obviously.

(49:47 - 49:56)
Okay? Don't make this mistake. I see people walk up, and they just try to use their arm to move the guy's leg. You'll never move someone's leg with your arm.

(49:57 - 50:13)
Okay? I have to use my legs to move him. I must pitch over to the side, and then position my knee, and now I hold the heel hook tight, and my left knee pushes his secondary leg out. When he goes to turn out now, no.

(50:13 - 50:24)
I've already got the heel hook in place. My knees go against it, and we get the break. Let's go further into the cross-axillary system.

(50:26 - 50:48)
We've seen that the big problem, the big picture that we're dealing with here is the turn out problem. My opponent, at any given moment, can start turning out, and then hide his heel, and eventually escape. Okay? We've seen one category of responses to this involves the use of two legs, double leg solutions, where we lock up the secondary leg, and from here, prevent turn outs.

(50:49 - 51:06)
This takes us to a new problem, the problem of the release. How am I going to manage releasing the leg so I can get to an inside heel hook on the primary leg? Okay? We've seen that we can put in a splitter hand and split our training partner's legs apart in this situation. Okay? This creates a new problem in itself.

(51:07 - 51:31)
Now, my opponent can run interference with the secondary leg by thrusting it into my armpit so that two feet go into my armpit and create unsatisfactory breaking conditions. Okay? Whenever I see someone running interference with a secondary leg, one of our favourite strategies here is the elbow slicer. As I see my opponent pushing in, I'm going to take my hand, and I'm going to grab ahold of my training partner's ankle, like so.

(51:33 - 51:48)
From here, as my opponent puts that interfering leg and pushes it into my armpit, I know it's going to be very, very difficult for me to get a clean break. So I'm going to take my elbow, and I'm going to position it right between my training partner's ankles. Do not just try to push with the strength of your elbow.

(51:48 - 52:05)
If he makes two strong legs locked together, I will never use elbow strength to push through. Use your body weight. As he locks his ankles close together, I'm going to lean over my opponent's ankles and body weight will enable me to slice my elbow between his two ankles.

(52:06 - 52:16)
Now, I simply arch back and split. Now, if we can explain the camera to Angolan on this, this is a very important detail. Currently, his heel is on the floor.

(52:16 - 52:28)
I'm going to position my forearm on the floor next to his heel. I have my hand on the heel. In order to expose my opponent's heel, we're going to use the lifting method.

(52:28 - 52:49)
Think of your forearm as being rather like a hurdle over which you must make your opponent's heel jump. I'm simply going to lift so that his shoelaces go into my armpit and his heel jumps over the top of my forearm. The moment we make that contact, my hands lock, my knees point back, and we're in perfect breaking position.

(52:49 - 52:58)
That's how we finish the elbow slicer. So, once again, we start off with good control over our opponent. I've put in a splitter hand, just like so.

(52:59 - 53:11)
My opponent recognises the danger and starts pushing, running interference. His secondary leg is now interfering with the primary, and as a result, breaking him here is going to be very difficult. So, from here, I'm going to seize the ankle.

(53:12 - 53:43)
I'm going to bring my elbow as a slicer between his ankles, and I'm going to use body weight to punch and separate my training partner's two feet. Now, his heel is currently in a position where I cannot get my forearm around it, so I use a lifting method, and I take my opponent's heel over the hurdle of my forearm and lock it in place. The moment that occurs, my bottom knee faces my top knee, and we're in the perfect position to go in and get the break.

(53:49 - 54:02)
Let's go further into the cross-arched ground system and look at some of the key elements of dealing with the problems that we're looking at. We've seen there's a central problem. The central problem is always the turn-out problem.

(54:03 - 54:29)
The overwhelming majority of my opponent's high-percentage defences to this situation involve turning out so that he hides his heel, and from here, ultimately unweights my leg so as to start to freeze me from my knee line. We've seen that one of our favourite ways to stop this kind of process from happening, a solution to the turn-out problem, is to switch to a new form of ashi dorami, the ankle-raised ashi. I go through on my training partner and tie up the secondary leg.

(54:30 - 54:37)
Now, the lower body cannot turn in that direction. Only his upper body can turn. We've seen, however, that this creates new problems.

(54:38 - 54:51)
At some point, I want to perform an inside heel hook on the primary leg. That means at some point, I have to release the secondary leg, and now the whole turn-out problem re-emerges. As I release the secondary, he's free now to turn out and start his escapes.

(54:52 - 55:13)
We've seen also a new problem has started to emerge, that when we put splitter hands in and go to attack, my opponent can run interference with the secondary leg and put two feet in my armpit in a way that makes it very, very difficult for me to break my opponent's primary leg. Okay? So these are the three problems we deal with here. There's the grand problem, the one that starts it all, the turn-out problem.

(55:14 - 55:24)
There's an extrapolation of this, the release problem. And now there's the interference problem. There's one way that I can operate that overcomes all three.

(55:24 - 55:39)
This is the over-under method. From a situation where I start off like so, I'm going to take my hand, and I'm going to put it here on my training partner's calf muscle. I'm going to bring my training partner's two knees together and close my knees, and I'm going to put my elbow down tight to his ankles.

(55:39 - 55:56)
This creates an incredible locus of control around my opponent's legs and hips. Essentially, what you've done here is you've created a five-point reach. You have one, two knees around your opponent, pinching in and wedging on the outside of the legs.

(55:57 - 56:16)
You have your hips as a wedge, a third wedge pushing up from underneath on your legs. You have a hand pushing down, sort of pulling down on top of your opponent's legs, and you have an elbow wedging down over both angles. So when my training partner Placido tries to pull out of you at Go, you are stuck to him like an anchor.

(56:17 - 56:27)
Wherever he turns, you will stick to him. And the knee line will be preserved. It's an incredibly tight, controlling position.

(56:28 - 56:39)
Okay? Five points of wedging around your opponent's legs and hips. We can go the extra distance now. I'm going to move my head away, and I'm going to make my hand into the shape of a knife.

(56:39 - 56:56)
I move over, and I steer the knife edge through my opponent's ankles and connect a sixth wedge, the shoelaces, to my neck. When my opponent goes to pull away from me now, you have a six-point wedge. From here, it's almost impossible for your opponent to pull, roll, or move away.

(56:57 - 57:13)
At the same time, you now have an exposed heel behind you. I can tilt my opponent over by planting a foot and using my cross-thigh position to take my opponent over and expose his heel. I lock in inside syncope with my legs, creating an even stronger wedging effect.

(57:14 - 57:23)
And now I use a reach back to go in and secure my training partner's heel. There's no reason now why I can't go through the legs and lock. Wherever he goes now, it doesn't matter.

(57:24 - 57:37)
The inside heel is locked, and we've got the finish in place. Let's have a look at this whole sequence again. From a situation where Pasito is locked up and my cross-archied around him.

(57:37 - 57:48)
We know the direction of his escape is out here. We tie up the secondary leg. Now, I bind his legs together, secure with my two knees, and create a five-point wedge.

(57:48 - 58:02)
One, two, three, four, five. We convert this to a six-point wedge by spearing the hand through and locking the shoelaces to our neck. From the six-point wedge, it's almost impossible for your opponent to pull away.

(58:03 - 58:12)
Now, from here, we have an exposed heel to work with. I can tilt my opponent in any number of different directions. I can tilt him to my left and expose his heel.

(58:13 - 58:28)
I can keep him where he is and expose the heel. I can roll face down and still expose the heel for the finish. You overrun the method.

(58:33 - 58:50)
Okay, let's look now at another method of controlling the situation at a cross-arched hiragana and getting through to a successful inside heel hook. We've seen from here, ultimately, we want to release the secondary leg and get through to an inside heel hook, the strongest of all the heel hooks in this situation. Again, going back to that idea of a hierarchy.

(58:50 - 59:02)
Out of all the various locks, we can use the inside heel hook as the top of the food chain. It's the best one, the one we prefer. So, we want to find ways to be able to control our opponent's leg, manage the release problem, and get through to a break.

(59:03 - 59:14)
In the previous move, we looked at the overrun the method. Let's look at a variation of that now, which I strongly favour, the double elbow method. From a situation where we start off, lace them like so, we go to a five-point wedge.

(59:15 - 59:28)
We've seen once again, we have one, two, my hips, three, my hand, four, and my elbow, five. Five points of wedge around our opponent's legs and hips. So, when he goes to move, it's extremely difficult.

(59:28 - 59:52)
We can convert this into a six-point wedge by making a knife hand, going through my opponent's ankles, and locking it up and using my neck as a sixth wedge. When he tries to tear out of this position, it's awfully, awfully difficult. Now, one potential problem with this situation is my opponent can start taking his foot and moving it in this direction so that it takes a long time for me now to access the heel hook.

(59:52 - 1:00:10)
When we see this, I point one elbow at Placido, and then I take my second elbow, throw it underneath, and I physically hold his heel and pull his shoelaces to my armpit. So now, both my elbows point at him. When he tries to move from here, it's shockingly difficult.

(1:00:10 - 1:00:30)
And now, because his shoelaces are in my armpit, the transition to the inside heel hook is incredibly quick, and we get very strong breaks as a result. Once again, from an ankle lace ashi yorami, I go through, and we take a five-point wedge. From the five-point wedge, we convert to a six-point wedge.

(1:00:30 - 1:00:47)
When he tries to hide his foot from me, one elbow is pointing at him, I take the second hand through and connect. So both my elbows point at him, double elbow. From the double elbow position, it's such a quick transition straight into the inside heel hook and a maximal break.

(1:00:54 - 1:01:22)
Let's go further into the cross ashi yorami system and look at the double cross method of dealing with the release problem. Here we have Placido. In the cross ashi yorami situation, we know the general course of his escape is a way turning out, and we know that one great solution to this is to lock up the secondary leg, okay? In the previous moves, we saw the idea of creating what we call a five-point wedge where I lock in, wedging with two knees, hips, hand, elbow.

(1:01:22 - 1:01:45)
From there, we perform a knife hand, we go through, and we convert to a six-point wedge, which is extremely difficult for my opponent to pull away from. Everything we did so far involved coming back directly to the heel. Another option is to take my opponent's secondary leg and make that cross my centre line so that both of my opponent's legs cross my centre line in opposite directions.

(1:01:45 - 1:02:02)
The way we do this is we move our head backwards. As the head goes backwards, I physically pull my opponent's leg across and I take a V-grip on my training partner's Achilles tendon. As a result, I can quickly push across the body and wedge over both of my training partner's ankles.

(1:02:03 - 1:02:20)
As he goes to pull away from me from here, both ankles are well wedged in place. I don't care whether you just go down with the arm or physically lock an Achilles lock. They're both good options, okay? Once we get this grip, when my opponent tries to turn his foot out in this direction, it's so difficult for him to prevent me using a reach back.

(1:02:20 - 1:02:31)
I take my thumb, and I go back, and I touch my own back. Here's a common problem. Sometimes I coach athletes who say they have a difficult time securing the heel in this position.

(1:02:32 - 1:02:51)
It's usually because their head and body are leaning too far back, and as a result, they cannot get to the heel. Whenever you see this problem, simply sit up and forward by employing a forward shift so that my head goes to the same height as your training partner's head. As a result, I can always reach back and secure my training partner's heel.

(1:02:52 - 1:03:17)
If I have to, I will use the strength of both legs to draw him back so his knee line goes back, and I have the heel in place. Then from here, we go over the top, release, and finish. An interesting corollary to this position where both legs go across is that if you should lose your opponent's knee line in the course of the action, and ultimately lose the leg, and the leg comes out, don't worry.

(1:03:18 - 1:03:44)
You're in the perfect position to renew your attacks. Simply by throwing your legs over the top, you can go right back in on the other side. Anytime I take my opponent's arms through in this situation and bring the leg across my body, anytime I lose my opponent's primary leg, his secondary leg will simply become your new primary leg, and you can make effortless switches from one leg to the other.

(1:03:45 - 1:03:52)
Let's quickly review the move as a whole. We start off as we did the others. We get a hold of our training partner's leg like so.

(1:03:53 - 1:04:06)
From here, we go immediately to a five-point wedge. Then we convert it to a six-point. From the six-point wedge, we move the head back, pass the foot across the centre line, and regroup it to hold it in place.

(1:04:06 - 1:04:26)
We put a wedge on top, and we sit up and forward to access the heel. From here, we get a tremendously strong break. We're looking at the cross-ashigurami position and the method of breaking from there, the inside yohoku.

(1:04:28 - 1:04:39)
So far, everything we've looked at has involved the use of both of our opponent's legs. We're appealing to the principle of double trouble. This is my personal favourite way of operating anytime we're in cross-ashigurami.

(1:04:39 - 1:05:02)
It's incredibly controlling, and essentially converts your ashigurami to a method of pinning your opponent's movement. As I said earlier, you'll see all of my students using this repeatedly in top international competition, and they're able to hold some of the biggest, strongest, and most talented opponents for long periods of time and work their way methodically for the break. It's an incredibly effective way of controlling people's movement out of ashigurami.

(1:05:03 - 1:05:26)
However, there are always going to be times where you cannot access the secondary leg, and you're going to have to go directly on the attack with one leg only under your control. This substantially changes the way we operate in this position. Because it means now, I don't really have a method of stopping my opponent from turning out.

(1:05:27 - 1:05:40)
So instead of stopping the turning out, I have to learn to control the turnout. Essentially, when I say control the turnout, it means controlling the speed or the pace of the turnout. Let's have a look at what I mean by this.

(1:05:42 - 1:05:53)
We've seen that the central problem in any cross ashigurami is the turnout problem. I would love to have heel exposure and get an inside heel hook on my opponent. He knows that, so of course he starts to turn.

(1:05:54 - 1:06:08)
When he starts to turn, he positions my head in the one place that will make me ineffective in this position. My head is now outside his legs. To be effective in this position, I need my head inside my opponent's legs.

(1:06:09 - 1:06:23)
Only then can I easily access the heel. The happiest times are when your opponent turns into you, because then he actually physically puts your head inside the legs and gives you the heel. But smart opponents know that, and so they're always turning away from you.

(1:06:24 - 1:06:52)
If I had the secondary leg, then we could use all the methods that we saw previously to go in and successfully complete the attack. But if I don't have the leg, what do I do now? Well, essentially what I have to do is I have to get my head back inside the legs, and I have to slow down the pace of my opponent's turn so that ultimately my turn is faster than his. I have to play catch-up so that I can get to the heel.

(1:06:53 - 1:07:07)
The problem is, most of the time, he goes first. He's the escaping guy, he bolts off, and you have to play catch-up. A very, very important concept whenever we work in this position is very simple to state.

(1:07:07 - 1:07:17)
Essentially what's going on here is a race. It's a race for my head position inside his legs. If I can win that race, I can access the heel.

(1:07:19 - 1:07:29)
Let's understand something. There's two ways to win a race of any kind. I can make myself faster, or I can make the other guy slower.

(1:07:30 - 1:07:40)
Usain Bolt is the fastest man in the world. I'm a 51-year-old cripple with a hip replacement. If we get into a 100-metre race, of course I'm going to lose very, very badly.

(1:07:41 - 1:07:56)
But if you let me shackle Usain Bolt's legs together and tie his hands behind his back, even I can win in a race of that nature. It's not because I got faster, it's because I made the other guy slower. Most of Jiu-Jitsu is built along those lines.

(1:07:57 - 1:08:22)
It's about making your opponent slower rather than yourself faster. How does this work in this case? How do I make Placido slower so that I can control the pace of the roll? Let's look at that right now. Whenever I'm in this position and I see my opponent's getting away, the first thing I like to do is put on a handbrake, where I put my left hand around my opponent's knee and I physically hold the knee tendons.

(1:08:22 - 1:08:50)
Don't just put your hand here superficially. That's not going to slow anybody down. I put my fingers all the way through and I bend my wrist 90 degrees so that it functions as a handbrake.

I close my elbow, so when Placido goes to turn, it won't stop him, but it will slow him down. The next thing I do is I take my elbow and I put it here, in the inside position. So I have a handbrake and an elbowbrake.

(1:08:51 - 1:09:00)
Now, the next part is, in my opinion, the most important. This is a head post. As we move over, I'm going to put my head on the floor.

(1:09:02 - 1:09:17)
This creates a barrier for my opponent to roll over and slows everything down dramatically. The fourth ingredient is my left foot. It hooks here, inside my training partner's left knee.

(1:09:19 - 1:10:48)
When he tries to pull his body around to continue his turn, the combination of my head, my leg, my hand, and my elbow dramatically slows him down, so that when I start to turn, I get to the heel every time, because my turn was faster than his. Not because I'm fast, but because I slowed him down. Let's have a look at that again.

Essentially here, we have a race. The race is for him to move in this direction and put my head outside of his legs, knowing that if he succeeds in doing so, I'll never access his heel. What I need to do is slow things down.

I take my hand and I go in here and lock. I put my elbow in place. Then, as we go into the turn, I put my head on the floor and my second foot locks in here at the knee.

When he goes to complete the turn, it slows him down dramatically. It means that I can get my head inside and access the heel, so that as we emerge on the outside of the roll, I have a heel in place and a potential break. Essentially what we're doing here is we're identifying the problem in the single leg situation as a shared spiral, just as it was with the outside heel.

(1:10:49 - 1:10:59)
We share the same spiral. We're spiralling in the same direction, and I have to control the speed of the spiral. In other words, my spiral has to go faster than his.

(1:11:00 - 1:11:09)
I don't rely on my speed to get it done. I rely on my ability to slow him down. Let's have a look one more time at this important sequence.

(1:11:12 - 1:11:21)
Once we get into a situation like this, and I don't have my opponent's secondary leg, the first thing I'll do is that. I'll put in a hand break. The second thing I'll do is this.

(1:11:22 - 1:11:35)
Even as he begins to turn, it's not as fast as he wanted it to be. Then I put my head down the floor, and my leg goes across. So that even as we emerge out the other side, the heel hook is on.

(1:11:36 - 1:12:18)
Now from here, my hands connect, and we get to a successful break. This is my favourite way to deal with the cross-ashi gurame in situations where we have only one leg under our control. Essentially, I put a series of basic, simple, mechanical breaks on my opponent.

My hand, my elbow position, my head post on the floor, and my interfering foot in his leg. This slows my opponent down sufficiently that I can win the race for head position. Get my head inside my opponent's legs, and therefore access the heel.

So that as we shear the spiral and roll through, I come out at the end of the spiral, ahead of my opponent, with a fully locked in inside heel hook.


## Volume 6

(0:02 - 11:58)
We'll be looking at the leg lock system we've seen as a general leg lock system and within that general system there are three subsystems, cross hashigurami, the straight hashigurami and reverse hashigurami. One of the most important points that we're trying to make as we work through this instructional series is the idea that for any given scenario, whether it be cross, straight or reverse hashigurami, there's always going to be one central problem in that scenario which guides and informs and directs the action between the two athletes. So we have Karl and Bernardo in a cross hashigurami situation.

It's well known what the two athletes want to do in this situation. Bernardo wants to expose his opponent's heel and control the two legs right around his opponent's leg. He can have his legs in a variety of configurations.

Karl Osaro's intention is always to prevent heel exposure and he does that by turning away. This creates the so-called turnout problem. From Bernardo's perspective the whole question of how he's going to successfully deal with this situation comes down to will he be able to overcome the turnout problem.

One way he can do this as we saw earlier is to control the secondary leg that prevents his opponent from turning out. But when he goes to release the secondary leg, now the same problem occurs. This is the so-called release problem that we spent some time investigating.

In a situation where we have a straight hashigurami, Karl will do a straight hashigurami, release, release. Karl does a straight hashigurami on Bernardo. Here it was a different problem.

When Karl Osaro goes to apply a heel hook, all the pressure is going in this direction and now we run into the problem of a shared spiral. So both athletes start spiralling in the same direction. If they just continue to spiral, nothing really results.

It's not a successful break. So there has to be some kind of dealing with this central problem, the problem of shared spirals. We're going to start looking now at reverse hashigurami, the third of the three subsystems in the general system.

We're going to see that there's a new problem that starts emerging in this interesting and different position. And this problem will motivate most of the ways we go to act and behave in this position. First and secondly, what the reverse hashigurami is.

Almost all the various hashiguramis involve two athletes facing each other. Reverse hashigurami is the only one where that's not true. I face the same direction as my opponent is facing.

In a situation where my opponent is down, we sit on top of our training partner and we have both legs in front of us. There's good news and bad news here. The good news is you have easy access to both of your opponent's legs.

That's a good thing. That's working with the principle of double travel, that both of my opponent's legs can be controlled at the same time. The bad news is my opponent's legs can easily be locked in a triangle or crossed feet or any other configuration he wants so that one leg can defend the other.

The fundamental problem of this position is always the problem of crossed legs. I want a leg lock of some kind on the leg that's between my legs. I have an hashigurami, two legs around one of my opponent's legs in this position, but he has an easy ability in this situation as the legs are right next to each other to lock up his legs defensively.

That's not true in the case of the other hashiguramis. In a straight hashigurami, I'm between his legs. So it's hard for him to access one leg to the other because my body's in obstruction.

It's hard for him to get one leg to defend the other. In the case of a cross hashigurami, it makes no sense for him to cross his legs in this situation. It's actually helping me out.

He'd be doing me a favour if he did this. In this way, he's actually giving me the leg that I want. It makes much more sense for him now to split his legs and start the action of turning away.

That's really much more in his interest. So my opponent can't really use one leg to defend the other very successfully here. That gives me what I want.

He can't do it in the case of a straight hashigurami because my body is in between his legs and as a result it's hard for him to use one leg to defend each other. When we go to reverse hashigurami, now he can easily use one leg to immediately do various attacks on my training partner's legs. I have a leg available now to do a multitude of attacks from this position.

He knows that and so he will always go into lock and defend his endangered leg, the leg between mine, with his second leg. So once again, we have a primary leg that is between my legs, it's inside an hashigurami, and we have a secondary leg defending the primary leg. The question is, how are we going to work in this set of circumstances to control our opponent and ultimately get through to a submission win? Well, let's first look at the notion of control.

How do I go to control this position? The first thing you're going to notice about this variation of reverse hashigurami is that it's inherently unstable. If Kamosawa tilts left, it's going to be an off-balancing. If he tilts right, that too is an off-balancing.

This is an inherently unstable position. Now, I can react to that by spreading my base. That's not really the wisest idea because now there's a great deal of space for him to start sliding his knee out.

So the first question is, how are we going to get some kind of stability here? Well, a good place for us to start is through his legs. I'm going to put my hand here on my training partner's knee and my second hand here on my training partner's heel. So I take a two-on-one grip on my training partner's primary leg.

Then I take an action of scissoring my legs. I put a wedge around my training partner's thigh and I hold him just like so. It's true, I've narrowed my base.

But on the other hand, I've got a much better control over my training partner's legs. Now, to go to a working situation like this, which seems to be a potential problem, if I see my training partner trying to off-balance me, I will use my legs more flexibly but always come back to a wedge position. So if I feel I'm going to lose base to my left, I'll put my foot out this briefly and then bring the wedge back in.

If I feel I'm going to lose base to my right, I'll put my right hand and right foot out the base and then return. But I never relinquish control of the knee. That's always my primary thing.

I can relinquish control of the ankle briefly, but not the knee. The moment the knee is released, any kind of off-balancing results in a loss of the leg overall. So, with regards to stability, I can't be naive and just have my legs wide.

It's not going to work at all. We want to first and foremost put a wedge underneath the knee with our wrists. I go in wrist-deep on my training partner's knee, and I bring my elbow back to myself, and I lift and compress the ankle just like so.

And I put a strong wedge effect by having my two feet pointing in roughly the same direction across my training partner's body. Then from here, flexibly, I use basing with hand and feet to make sure that I'm stable in this position long enough to get the job done. Now, at some point, I want to get a more genuine kind of stability than this.

So, what I'm going to do is put my knee down on the floor just like so. I'm going to take my arm and I'm going to scoop my training partner's leg so that both legs are controlled. And then from here, I'm going to pitch down to her hip into a stable position.

If my opponent tries to move in this position, both legs are controlled, and it's very, very difficult for him to move successfully. If I release one of my opponent's legs, now I can start the action of getting up on top of me and causing problems. So, a very important element of this position is this idea of double trouble, that I want to control both of my opponent's legs in a kind of double leg tackle position that prevents my opponent from getting up on top of me.

So, let's look again at the basic problems that we're dealing with here. First, the nature of the position, reverse ashigurami. This is unique amongst all the ashiguramis.

It's about the only one I'm facing away from my opponent's body. All the other ones I face towards my opponent. The central problem we're dealing with here is the problem of locked legs.

The very nature of this position means my opponent can easily lock his legs defensively, and now the primary leg is defended well by the secondary leg. This is unique to this situation. First things first, we need to go in and effectively control the legs.

The leg we want to control is the primary leg. So, I take a wrist-deep wedge and put it underneath my training partner's knee. I take a grip on my training partner's heel, and I pull everything up towards me to tighten and cinch the position that I'm in.

I want to scissor my legs like so. I don't want my knees wide apart. I want my knees pointing in the same direction to form effective wedges around my opponent.

Initially, stability is offered by the feet. My opponent goes to move around. I put feet, hand, feet, hand, but at some point I want to get them to work, so I can't be worried too much about stability.

So, I take my knee and I put my knee right there underneath my training partner's buttocks. I take my second arm and I lock, tackling both legs, and I go down to a shoulder and a hip, and we just lock up like so. When Kamosara goes to move, get up on top, we can't do it with both legs controlled.

So, now we've achieved the stability and control of both of my training partner's legs. We're looking at reverse Ashi-Gurami, the third of the three subsystems that, in unison, form the general leg lock system. We've looked at the idea of stability and control.

That's always our first concern. Control first, submission second. We've seen that reverse Ashi-Gurami is quite unique.

It's the only, out of all the major forms of Ashi-Gurami, it's the only one where we face away from our opponent, as opposed to a normal situation where we face towards our opponent. We've seen, as always, our primary goal is to get control of our opponent. That's relatively easy to do in the case of reverse Ashi-Gurami because both legs are directly in front of us, so we can use the principle of double trouble to tackle both legs and start looking for stability.

One way to find stability is to go down to a hip rather than balancing precariously on top of our training partner. Now, a very interesting thing about reverse Ashi-Gurami is it starts to bring in different forms of leg lock than we've been looking at so far. When I was beginning in Jiu-Jitsu, leg lock mastery was always understood as who knew the most leg locks.

If you knew a hundred leg locks, you were more of a leg lock master than the guy who knew ten leg locks. A big part of my approach to leg locking has been to try to change that perception. If you look at my students, literally 95% of their leg lock submissions come from two moves, an inside heel hook and an outside heel hook.

They don't know a vast number of finishes. In truth, I could sit here all day and teach you literally hundreds of different exotic leg locks and it would do absolutely nothing to make you better at finishing people in top level competition. I would rather you had two high percentage leg locks that really work all the way up to world championship level than you have a thousand ineffective exotic leg locks that couldn't finish my grandmother.

(11:59 - 18:19)
Let's go into this now. We're going to introduce two more leg locks, the knee bar and the figure four toe hold. In truth, my leg lock system really works around inside heel hook, outside heel hook as the vast majority of finishes, but these are supplemented by knee bar finishes and figure four toe holds, which also play a useful role in the leg lock system.

Beyond that, I don't really teach many others. We've seen from a reverse hashigurami situation, we first want some kind of stability. We saw as our opponent locks up his legs, this creates the first and what I believe is the central problem of the reverse hashigurami system, the problem of tied legs or crossed legs or triangle legs.

The primary leg is being defended by the secondary leg. Once my opponent gets into this kind of defensive arrangement, now he can start to destabilise me in this position and hopefully from his perspective, get his legs free. I want the exact opposite.

I want to tie his legs up, put a knee down on the floor, tackle both legs and get down to a stable position on my hip. Now we've got two legs in front of us. You guys all know that the real game here is to get to the primary leg.

That's the leg that's actually inside my hashigurami. An interesting thing about figure four toe holds is they are one of the very few locks which can reliably and effectively be used without the use of an hashigurami. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply a figure four toe hold on my training partner's secondary leg.

The primary leg is still controlled by my hashigurami. The secondary leg is right there in front of me, ready to be taken advantage of. I'm going to take a hand through and I'm going to take a hold of my training partner's foot in a very particular way.

I want to take the smallest knuckle of my pinky finger to the first knuckle of my pinky finger to the first knuckle of my training partner's smallest toe. So I come through and chop right there. You'll see a direct correlation between my first pinky knuckle and the first knuckle of his smallest toe.

Don't sell yourself short. Don't grab the short end of the lever. When we started this DVD we talked about the idea of lever and fulcrum and we said it would inform much of what we went over in this DVD series.

It's so important that we grab properly to maximise the use of leverage. So often I see people grab in inefficient ways halfway down the lever. This may not look like much but at world championship level the difference between this and this can be the difference between a gold medal and nothing.

Let's make sure we grip properly. First knuckle to first knuckle right in place. Some people like to use a thumb, some people don't.

Generally it's correlated with the size of your training partner's foot. The bigger the foot the more difficult it is to cover it with the thumb. From here I go through and I take my arm and I go elbow deep at the ankle.

Don't come up here on the shin. When you grip on the shin you can see a huge amount of daylight between my two hands and his foot. That's not a good thing.

I come around elbow deep and thread all the way up there on my own wrist. So there's very little daylight between my wrist and forearm and his feet. I start an action of pushing with the left hand in towards my training partner's buttocks and then the most important part.

My left hand is my push hand but the right hand forms a frame and that becomes my pulling arm. The key is that from here I push with the left hand and I pull with the right elbow. As we saw in earlier segments of this dvd series the key to tearing the ligaments of the feet ankles and knee consists of coupled forces where I have forces going in opposing directions.

Just as you tear a piece of paper by shredding in different directions so too with joints. If I simply push on my training partner's foot with no pull nothing will happen. If I just pull with no push nothing will happen.

Only the combination of a push with my left hand and a pull with my right elbow will get the desired results. So what we like to do is to take our training partner's big toe and push it straight towards his tailbone. Then from here I come back in the opposite direction with my elbow so that I get a push with the left hand towards the tailbone and a pull of my right elbow back towards my own jaw.

This combination of forces creates a tremendous torque which is directly felt on the ankle much more than the knee. Once again from a situation where my training partner has his legs locked defensively I reach and I grab smallest of first knuckle to first knuckle just like so. Once I make that catch I bring the foot in towards me.

I bring my frame arm to the ankle not the shin. I go through and my hand locks right over the wrist. Don't grab down on your forearm where you can see a vast amount of daylight between your hands and his feet.

Grip up high just like so. Start with a push towards your training partner's tailbone then go with a pull of your elbow towards your own jaw. The only way my opponent can defend this lock is to take his primary leg and push on my hands.

If he can do this he can break the lock. When he does it however he exposes what I really wanted all along the primary leg. From here I grip the heel and then post it.

We take our hand in the shape of a V and block our training partner at the ankle and as a result I can swim around my training partner's body and put my hand on my own thigh. Then from here I lock the figure of four and I point my right knee directly towards his tailbone. As a result I can drive my pelvis forward.

(18:21 - 18:33)
Always make sure that we use the single most important breaking fulcrum in the human body. The bones of the hip. I do not position my opponent's knee in the middle of my legs.

(18:34 - 20:13)
That would use the soft adductor muscles as the breaking fulcrum. Not very efficient. I want to use this leg across my hip bump so I put my hand on my own thigh.

I close my elbow. The action of closing the elbow puts tremendous tension and removes all the slack from my training partner's knee. The last danger is that my opponent will kick this leg free and start to escape by coming up to his knees.

We don't want that. So let's make sure at the last second we always connect his foot to our body to prevent that from happening. Now directionality of force.

My knee straight to his tailbone. From here I block on board. Watch my left elbow take the slack out of the joint.

Remember every time we go to break legs take the slack out of the joint first then break your opponent. As Kyle tries to move away both legs are controlled. Go to move away Tom.

It's so difficult. This is a true example of double trouble in an operation. Now from here I drive the pelvis forward and we get a strong finish.

Do you remember what we said earlier about the idea of follow through? About how one of the keys to strong breaking is the idea of not going to a breaking point but through a breaking point. This is a good example. Let's find the breaking point.

It's there. Now if I release the leg you can clearly see that I can still move a long way through the breaking point. This means we'll have a decisive break should the occasion demand it.

(20:27 - 23:45)
So let's have a look at the Ushiro Senkaku or reverse Ushiro Senkaku position. A big danger here is a strong opponent like Bernardo Fari will put his hands on my back and start pushing and that will quickly destabilise me and put me on my hip on the ground. This is not a position I want to be in.

It's very very easy now for my opponent to start coming up on top of me. So one of the big things you want to guard against is having people coming up on top by pushing and sliding the hips. This is particularly true with strong opponents who have a good ability to destabilise.

So how can we ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen? We've seen a big part of it is this use of a wedge in here. Then the use of our hand on the ankle to tie everything in close. The more Bernardo's legs extend down in this direction the easier it is to start pushing me and taking me out of balance.

So we want to draw everything up towards us. We lock in and control. Now I turn my knees so they're an effective wedge.

If Bernardo takes my body to his left there's things we can do from here, don't get me wrong, but it's not as desirable as falling across the body. In these situations I can fully determine where we fall by putting my knee on the floor. From here when Bernardo goes to push me off I lock the second leg.

Now as strong as Bernardo is when he goes to get up it's incredibly difficult with both legs controlled. All this time it's a relatively easy thing to control my training partner gripping precisely on the toe line. I lock up then from here we start with a push and finish with a pull.

Bernardo has to use his primary leg to start kicking out and defend the secondary leg. That's again exactly what we're looking for. We take this grip pass it around and then from here I take the slack out of the joint by closing the elbow.

I lock a full Senkaku. My knee points at my training partner's tailbone and we drive forward for the finish. We've been looking at the reverse Ashigurami position, the third of the three subsystems which in unison make the general leg lock system.

Let's go further into this reverse Ashigurami and start to look at some of the main techniques and techniques we use from this position. We've seen the first issue here is that of stability. I can't just be shaken off down to the floor where I no longer control my opponent with body weight and now he can actually threaten my back in this situation.

It's not good. The second issue is the primary concern that I have as the attacker that my opponent can lock his primary leg with his secondary leg and defend it. Here you can clearly see the primary leg is defended by the secondary leg in this triangle.

(23:46 - 25:22)
Reacting to this, this problem of cross or triangle legs motivates and gives direction to this position. We've seen once we've established stability, most of the time I like to see my athletes come down to the floor, knee first, tie up both legs utilising the principle of double travel and falling down to a stable position from where they can attack the figure four toehold on the secondary leg. When this opponent goes to defend, a dilemma is created.

If my opponent doesn't defend, I'll break him right here. If he does defend, I'll break him here. So it's a nice dilemma between the two legs.

Is that the only way I can operate? Absolutely not. One excellent way for us to look at this position, once my opponent starts locking up and defending, is to see opportunities on both sides of my opponent's body. One of the really interesting things about the reverse ashigurami is that it's a gateway position.

There's a reason why I taught third out of the three subsystems of ashigurami, because reverse ashigurami is a gateway to the first two. The beauty of reverse ashigurami is it's a symmetrical position between my training partner's legs. That means that if my opponent's legs are unlocked, if I fall inside his legs, I fall directly into a straight ashigurami variation which we call outside ashigurami.

(25:25 - 25:49)
If on the other hand, I fall the other way, I fall directly into cross ashigurami. The important point here is that if I have a reverse ashigurami and I fall either left or right, I fall into the two other systems of the leglock system in general. So I can play this knowledge against my opponent in ways that are extremely useful.

(25:51 - 27:28)
From reverse ashigurami, when I see my opponent defend himself, one of my favourite strategies here is to use a simple method of untying my training partner's legs. That simple method involves me first tying up my opponent's primary leg. Then I reach down and I get a hold of my training partner's secondary leg right down at the toe line.

I catch it and I pull the leg in. When I go to use this method, my hand switches from the knee. I lift and I go underneath the heel just like so.

So my hand catches at my training partner's heel and toe. So the grip we're employing starts at the toes and goes to the heel. Now, when Kyle goes to make his legs strong and resistant, the directionality of force is not to pull towards me.

Make a strong leg, I can never pull straight back into his legs. It's like trying to pull him to the strength of squatting or leg pressing. It's very, very difficult.

What I do is I pull across my centre line and that immediately weakens my opponent's ability to resist me. When he goes to straighten his legs from here, it's almost impossible. We keep everything in close, putting him in a mechanically weak position.

As a result, now we can reliably untie our training partner's legs. Okay. So once again, I have an opponent with a strong defensive structure here.

As always, I start by going over my opponent's knee like so. I catch my training partner and I start the action of lifting and I expose my training partner's heel. I get a hold of heel and toes.

(27:28 - 28:55)
He tries to resist me here and it's a very easy thing for me to untie his legs. Essentially, you're untying the knot of your opponent's legs. So once again, I'm in the reverse Ashigarami position.

My opponent is defending the primary leg with the secondary leg by locking a triangle. I have to be able to untie that triangle. I go through on my training partner.

I catch my training partner at the toe line. I start the action of lifting across. I catch the heel.

Now, I kind of lock up this leg as tight as you can. He won't be able to stop me from pulling across and untying the legs. Once the legs are untied, it's time to go to work.

I'm going to release my training partner's secondary leg. I'm going to bring the primary leg back to me and I'm going to put my biceps over the toes. That's a very important detail.

I enter at the toes, not the heel. Biceps cover the toes and then from here, the heel goes in. Now, I want a controlled descent to the floor.

That's a very important thing. So often I see people get this position and they simply fall like a brick down to the mat and they lose control of the leg. That's not what we want.

A controlled descent goes like this. I take my foot to my training partner's hip and I put my knee on the floor. The knee becomes the elbow.

The hands lock and we have outside ashi garami. From here, we lock it up. Everything's extraordinarily tight.

(28:55 - 33:38)
I put my head over my training partner's foot and we lift up for the finish. As always, we're finishing on our elbow. The inside leg pressures down on my training partner's knee.

My hips come off the floor and we lift the heel for the finish to create that coupled force going in opposite directions for a strong break. Let's have a look at this whole sequence again. We start off in reverse ashi garami.

My opponent locks up his legs defensively. From here, I put a wedge over the top, catch my training partner's toe line and draw the leg up towards me. I go through and I catch my training partner at the heel.

Even when his legs are locked defensively from here, I pull across and I untie my training partner's legs. From here, I want to go to a straight ashi garami. That means I have to put my knee on the floor and fall in this direction.

I don't want to go down to the floor until I have the heel hook in place. I bring my body so I can look at my training partner's shoelaces. If you try to get a heel hook from here, it'll never happen.

I have to be able to look into my training partner's shoelaces. I immediately put my bicep on top of my training partner's toes. So if he goes to lock a triangle a second time, it's all interfered with by my arm.

The heel hook is essentially in place. I want a controlled descent to the mat. The foot starts it.

The knee is next. Then my hands lock, my feet come close together and I go down to the mat. As Kyle tries to come up and defend himself, it's so difficult.

I'm going to get a bone-breaking finish down on the floor. We've been looking at the reverse ashi garami. We've seen that reverse ashi garami can be used to function as a gateway to the other two ashi garami.

Straight ashi garami family and cross ashi garami. Let's look now how instead of using heel hooks, we can employ a figure four toe hold with a lot of effect. On the reverse ashi garami position, we know that it's very much in my opponent's interest to lock his legs defensively.

This defensive lock is what generates most of the action in this position. If my opponent didn't lock his legs defensively, I would just go straight into a kneebar. What makes this position interesting is that your opponent can defend himself by locking their legs.

This is the primary problem associated with the reverse ashi garami position. We've seen different ways to deal with this. We can fall over to the side and then play a dilemma between a figure four toehold on one leg and a kneebar on the other.

We've seen this by coming in here at the toes and then exposing the heel and untying our training partner's legs. We saw as a result of this that we could go directly into a heel hook attack from this position. Heel hooks aren't your only option.

We can also employ the figure four toe hold from this position. I'm particularly enthusiastic about teaching this position to you because this will illustrate a lot about the nature of twisting locks, in particular twisting leg locks, which can be a benefit to people who compete in tournaments where heel hooks are illegal. The general point that I want to raise here is that the mechanics of a figure four toe hold and the mechanics of a heel hook are directly related to each other.

They both involve a push on the toes and a pull on the heel simultaneously. The only difference is the mechanism by which you do it. In the case of a heel hook, it's done through the arm and the torso.

In the case of the figure four toe hold, it's done through the hands, wrists, and arms. There's a sense in which the figure four toe hold is just a heel hook applied with the hands and arms. So, from the situation where my opponent's locked up defensively, we know that we start the ball rolling by peeling one leg across the centre line to expose the heel of the second leg.

From here, we go in and we catch our training partner. We always do so in the most mechanically efficient fashion. Don't just grab anywhere.

Make sure you're precise. The smallest knuckle to the smallest knuckle. We go through.

(33:38 - 34:58)
Don't put your arm anywhere. Don't go around the shin. Go all the way up to your training partner's elbow.

When I sit down to the floor, I want to keep my opponent's foot as close to my hips as possible. The more my training partner's leg extends, the harder it becomes to finish in this position. So, I want to make sure that I keep his toes down in the pocket of my hip.

As a result, I have two arms here. I have a pushing hand and a pulling hand. The push hand pushes my training partner's toes towards his tailbone.

Now, I take my elbow and I sweep it down to the end of the lever. Watch my right elbow. My right elbow goes in, my head follows it, and as a result, a hundred percent of my body weight goes into what can only be described as a heinous leg lock.

There's true breaking pressure here that'll match any heel hook. Now, I've taken Kamasara to the breaking point here, but you can clearly see that there's a huge amount of follow-through, which will signify what could be a catastrophic break. Once again, for a situation where I start off and reverse Ashiharani, first, we need to untangle those legs.

(34:59 - 36:55)
We catch, lift across the centre line, and catch the heel. As Kamasara goes to recover the position, he finds it very, very difficult. Now, I release the secondary leg and I catch the primary right there at the toes.

Once I do so, I throttle around, I put my knee on the floor, I push his toes into my hip. As a result, I can back heel with my legs to tie everything up. My head goes around the corner and we get tremendous breaking pressure.

Don't look at the lock. Bring everything out and around, and that's where the breaking power comes from, the pull of my elbow. So, let's have a look at some of these key features.

Starting off, sitting on our training partner, legs up. Now, we're going to take our hands and we're going to catch our training partner at the toes, same here, good, and we're going to pull across the centre line. You can see that this begins to untangle our training partner's legs.

Now, our other hand is going to catch our training partner at the heel, securing a good grip, and now we separate the legs, like so. He's now successfully untangled those defensive legs. Now, it's time to devote our attention to the primary leg.

So, we release the secondary and our hand goes in and catches our training partner all the way so that the smallest knuckle of the smallest finger goes in to the first knuckle of the smallest toe. Now, from here, we go through and lock the figure of four, making sure that we minimise the space between ourselves and our opponent's foot by bringing the hand up all the way, like so. Now, our knee is going to come down to the mat and we're going to fall onto our right hand side.

(36:56 - 38:13)
Our legs are going to lock and then from here, we're going to keep our opponent's foot as close to our hip as possible. From here, we're going to bring our elbow down to our training partner's heel so that when we push with the right hand and pull with the left, we get tremendous breaking pressure and it all starts with the head. He's going to look away from his opponent and he's moving.

Here's a key detail. What I can't have is the head stationary, sorry, the hands stationary and the head moving away from the hands. The distance between the hands and the head never changes.

As the head moves away, he pushes in like so and there we get the break. Okay, very good. This makes completely sense, right? When I move my head, my elbow automatically opens, right? Ultimately, it's about your elbow coming down to the end of the lever and the elbow sweeping back with your head.

Notice how the elbow moves with the head. Here's the head. As the head moves back, the elbow follows and the hand pushes in here.

So, the right pushes, left pulls and we get a very strong break. Well done, Bernardo. Man, that's impressive.

(38:18 - 39:12)
We've been looking at the reverse Ashigurami position, the third of the various subsystems that comprise the general system of leg locking. We're trying to say that reverse Ashigurami has some unique properties. One is obvious, the fact that I'm facing away from my opponent instead of facing towards him.

Anyone can see that. Less obvious is the idea that this position functions as a perfect gateway into the other two subsystems. If I had this position, it's very easy for me to fall into straight Ashiguramis.

It's equally easy for me to fall into cross Ashiguramis. From a situation like so, it's not difficult for us to start that action of untangling our training partner's legs. Every so often, however, you will come up against a very, very strong legged opponent and you will feel it's difficult to untangle the legs in these situations.

(39:12 - 41:24)
Whenever we see that, an excellent way for us to operate is to catch differently. I catch my training partner at the heel and I catch here at the ankle. As Kamosada makes a strong resistance, I want to focus on lifting his ankle over my knee so his ankle goes from below my knee to above my knee.

Once it's above my knee, he can never return it because my knee functions as a wedge underneath his calf muscle. Now, controlling my training partner's two feet, I bring my left knee underneath my training partner's left knee, just like so. I start an action of turning and I pop my knee through my training partner's hip.

As a result, we find ourselves in a perfect position to close the figure of four, the Senkaku, on the inside of our training partner's legs. Now watch my right hand. My right hand releases my training partner's foot and catches a two-on-one grip on my training partner's knee.

As a result, I can go forward on my training partner and capture the heel. Now, it's very much in Kamosada's interest to keep his foot moving in this direction. Once I get control of my training partner, I just keep the ankle underneath my armpit.

I don't release it. I release my hand but not his foot and I come forward and I collect the second leg. Now, we've fallen into a perfect attacking position.

I now have to cross Ashigurami with both of my training partner's ankles legs and it's a very, very controlling position for me to work from. When he tries to move away from me, it's shockingly difficult and from here the whole cross Ashigurami system goes into operation. Once again, using reverse Ashigurami as a gateway to other forms of Ashigurami.

We start off with the reverse Ashigurami. My opponent's legs are locked up well defensively. Normally from here, we like to untie our training partner's legs so we can go into various forms of leg lock activity.

Figure four toe holds, heel hooks, etc. Sometimes, it's difficult to do this. Whenever you feel it's very difficult, catch the heels on both of my training partner's legs and I put his ankle over my knee.

(41:25 - 42:51)
Once we get to a position like this, it's not difficult for us to make transfers into some of our favourite leg lock attacking positions. I need to start a general action of turning into my training partner. I go over the top of my training partner's ankle.

I could just tie it up in this position or I could just hold underneath just like so. This is my favourite way to make the turn. Watch my left knee close in as a wedge underneath my training partner's legs and now I sit to my buttocks.

The most important thing is my right knee will go inside my training partner's hip and thigh just like so. When he goes to turn to me, my knee makes it very very difficult for him and as a result, we can go through and catch our training partner at the ankle. We now have the perfect cross Ashigurami position with laced ankles.

When he tries to move from here, it's very very difficult. As we saw in the earlier segments, my real goal now will be to get to my training partner's primary leg at the heel and go into the heel hooking game. Initially, we can just control our training partner's legs and go into laced legs etc.

etc. You can go into attack Achilles locks, he walks on the secondary leg but ultimately, as we saw in the previous sequences or segments, we're looking to heel hook this leg. This is an easy way for us to go from one good position to an even better one.

(42:56 - 45:55)
Once again, working with my training partner here, we catch up and bring his foot over the top. I bring my knee in as a wedge. When he tries to recover his leg position, it's extraordinarily difficult from this position.

From here, it's not a difficult thing for us to go under and control and keep both legs in a position where it's hard for him to extend either leg. When I separate my training partner's legs, watch my right knee pop inside. My left knee goes inside my training partner's ankle like so and I hold on this two-on-one grip.

When he goes to pull away from me, it's shockingly difficult. You have excellent control of your training partner's legs. Initially, we bring the two legs in nice and close.

I could go directly for a lace leg attack here or, perhaps more realistically, we'll go into the various sequences that enable us to cover our training partner's heel and finish with inside heel hooks. Most of the time now, my partner will be trying to turn in this direction and we'll work as we saw in the earlier segments from this position. We've been looking at the broad structure of this leg lock system.

We've seen that really what people call the leg lock system in actuality is three subsystems that are linked together. When it's time to actually go out on the mat and wrestle someone and try to leg lock them, you're going to be using one of those three subsystems as your means of actually establishing contact with your opponent and going through to a win. A really interesting question is to ask, what's the relationship between the three subsystems? Obviously, structurally, they're very different.

Cross-Ashigurami has a very different mechanism of control and a very different mechanism of finishing from straight Ashigurami and you can say the same about reverse Ashigurami. Nonetheless, there are strong links between all three. Whenever people come to study leg locks with me, often they ask me one question which is, okay, your system is based around a hierarchy.

Why don't I just focus on the apex of the hierarchy? If the number one method of attack is the Cross-Ashigurami inside heel hook, why don't I just spend all my time on that? That's the best one. Well, the truth is, you're going to get the best results out of the leg lock system by having moves that work in unison to create dilemmas. It's very important we go over what is the nature of a dilemma and why is it so important for not only the leg lock system but Jiu-Jitsu in general.

I always say to my students, good Jiu-Jitsu players create problems for their opponents, but great Jiu-Jitsu players don't create problems, they create dilemmas. What's the difference? Every problem has a solution. Dilemmas don't really have solutions.

(45:56 - 47:23)
They're just two bad outcomes and you've got to make a choice between two undesirable outcomes. Whenever we go to work in the sport of Jiu-Jitsu, our task is not to create problems for our opponent but as often as possible to create dilemmas. The single most important dilemma in the leg lock system is the dilemma between the threat of outside heel hooks and the threat of inside heel hooks, between the threats that come from straight Ashi-Gurami and the threats that come from cross Ashi-Gurami.

The interplay between these two is what creates so many of the breakthroughs for my students. The only way you're going to have a devastating set of attacks for inside heel hooks is to be strong with your outside heel hooks and the only way you're going to have devastating attacks with your outside heel hooks is to have a strong viable threat of inside heel hooks. The two function in the same way that a jab and a cross function in boxing.

One sets up the other. You can only avoid one by exposing yourself to the other. If you only focus on one, you're going to quickly become predictable and your opponent will be able to position himself in certain ways that block your attacks.

But when you can threaten both back to back, your opponent's reaction to one will always open up the other. This is the basis of dilemma theory in the leg locking game. Let's start to look now in practical terms at how this plays out.

(47:26 - 47:35)
We know that our number one method of entering into our training partner's legs is the so-called Rimi Ashigarami. This is the basis of our entry pattern. I have an opponent on two knees.

(47:38 - 50:17)
From any method of entering in, let's say an elevation method, we get our opponent up and we go into an Rimi Ashigarami like so. Now, once we get into this position, the central guide as to where the action will go in the next few seconds is always betrayed by my opponent's head. The manner in which his head goes to move will determine how I go to attack the leg.

Many of your opponents threatened with this position will move the head away in an attempt to put a foot on the buttocks and scoot out and escape what they think is the threat of an initial outside heel hook. We saw when we looked at the outside heel hook system, this is not really a particularly effective way of operating. Whenever I see Kolmasara's head move away, look what happens to his ankle.

The ankle becomes exposed. Remember, we're always looking for some method of exposing our training partner's heels. The moment the head moves away, it can only happen in a way where it exposes my training partner's heel.

When I see the head move away, I simply cover the shoelaces with my bicep and lock up. From here, we switch from the Rimi Ashigarami and lock. When he tries to move away from me, I'm pointing my knees at the floor.

It's so easy now to apply pressure, roll through, make the switch to an outside Ashigarami, and now we're in a strong breaking position. So the first one of the dilemma was based on situations where my opponent's head moves away from me. If the head moves away, he will always expose himself at the heel and lead directly into the straight Ashigarami system, which involves a switch of various Ashigaramis, culminating in an outside Ashigarami and a strong breaking position.

Pretty soon, your opponent's going to figure that out. And they're going to realise that when the head moves away, the heel becomes exposed. So they're all going to do the same thing.

They're going to bring the head back to face us and put the heel on the floor. And as a result, there's no heel exposure. However, this comes at a very heavy price.

Yes, I don't have heel exposure, but I can always lock up the ankle. Now I put my left foot on my training partner's left buttock, the so-called cross buttock position. My right foot goes through and hooks onto the front of my training partner's quadriceps.

(50:18 - 50:27)
If I can, I always like to grip my training partner at the head. If my opponent's head is so far away that I can't do it, that's fine. I can do it without it.

(50:28 - 50:53)
Now, I want to lift and elevate my opponent by bringing my knees up to my chest. This will have an immediate destabilising effect on my training partner. As a result, his hips go directly over my head.

We now use what we call a hand assist. There's a danger of my opponent lifting his leg high, but I can't get my knee behind it as a wedge. A hand assist prevents this from happening.

(50:54 - 54:59)
I catch the knee, so when he goes to lift high, he can't do it. As a result, I can easily pull my knee behind his as a wedge. Now when he tries to rise, there's nowhere to go.

Now, we know that our next step is to break our training partner down to a hip. The correct directionality of force is always across the hip line. His basic support is his hands, but when I go across the line of hips, there's simply no basic support.

His ankles are tied together, and as a result, we can easily tilt our training partner down to the mat. What we've got here is a true dilemma. As I enter the Urumi Ashi-Gurami position, my opponent can either move away from me and expose his heel to the outside Ashi-Gurami system or square up to me and expose himself to the cross Ashi-Gurami system.

Let's look at some examples of this technique. For a situation where I'm tied with my training partner, and we draw him in, we go immediately into the legs. I see Kamisage here move away.

We roll through and finish. My opponent learns, he goes to square up to me. From here, I go cross body position, watch my right foot pommel through, and go to my training partner's hips.

If possible, I catch my training partner by the hip. If not, that's fine. Now, we bring knees to chest, and we bring our opponent's body in a situation where I can easily hand assist, catch, and put my knee behind his.

Now, I push along the line of the hips, sit my opponent down into a winning position. This simple dilemma, based on my opponent's head position, whether the head moves away or whether the head moves towards me, is the basis of how we use these two in unison to create attacking opportunities. My opponent has to go one or the other.

The head has to either move away from me or towards me. In either case, it leads into a devastating Ashi-Gurami based heel hook attack. When I see my opponent moving in towards me, it's so important that my foot goes across body position.

The second foot comes through and locks the tight grip on my training partner's quadriceps. This is essentially an X-Guard in reverse. Now, from here, even when my opponent puts his weight back and away from me, it's not a difficult thing for me to bring knees to chest.

That starts the ball rolling and gets him close to me. The last element is the extension of my legs that brings his hips directly over my head and my lower back off the floor. When he goes to pull away from me, I just hold the knee and the hand assist pulls him into a winning position.

From here, pushing across the hips creates a perfect attacking position. An ankle lace cross Ashi-Gurami is extremely difficult for my opponent to get away from. We're looking at the idea of bringing the notion of dilemmas into leg locking in particular and Jiu-Jitsu in general.

I always say this, good players create problems for their opponents, great players create dilemmas. We just looked at one of the foundational dilemmas of our leg lock system, based around our opponent's reaction, which is visible through their head position. When they move away from us, they're going to expose their own heel to the outside straight Ashi-Gurami game.

When their head moves towards us and they square up, they're going to expose their entire hip, both hips, to the cross Ashi-Gurami game. Let's look now at other ways in which dilemmas start to play an important role in our leg lock system. If we have an opponent in any given Ashi-Gurami, let's say for example cross Ashi-Gurami.

(55:01 - 1:01:57)
There's always going to be those times where you feel you're about to lose control of your opponent's knee as it slips out of your knee line. Say for example, I'm working here and Kama-Sai does a good job of turning and rotating and essentially now I've lost the position. The knee is now free.

Once again, from any situation where I have a given Ashi-Gurami on my opponent, here I'm demonstrating with cross Ashi-Gurami, I need to have his knee inside my knee line. He knows that and he will also be thumb-posting. Turn the other way.

Thumb-posting, pushing out, etc, etc. Whenever I feel I'm going to lose my training partner's leg on one side, it's up to me to create a dilemma by threatening the other side. So if I feel the knee is starting to come out and I'm losing control of it, I will often in these circumstances willingly put my foot out as the knee, as the leg continues out.

Now it's up to me to go into a very special grip. I thread my hand through and around and I palm-hold and I take a scoop grip on my training partner's leg. The key element to a scoop grip is that my hand goes above my training partner's knee and my elbow flares up to control my training partner's lower leg.

So the upper leg is controlled by hand and wrist and the lower leg is controlled by elbow. As Kama-Sai squares up to me and goes to pull away, walking back on his hands, walking back on his hands, look how far Kama-Sai has gotten away from me. It means nothing.

Even with his other foot pressing into the floor, I can always draw him back to me. This is a shockingly strong and intimidating grip. I'll do this again.

Even as Kama-Sai moves away from me, it looks like I'm completely losing control of his body, but because both upper body and lower body are well controlled, even when he pushes off the floor with hand, you can pull him back in like a child. Once again, he moves away. Now, once we get that pull, it's nothing special on my part.

It's just the structure of the human body. Just draw him back in. I want to do this with my legs in a better position.

So, I had a cross-Ashi-Urami situation with my training partner. He did a good job of escaping his knee from my knee line. I can see what's happening.

I'm losing the knee, just like a rocket science to figure this out. I put in my grip and step out. He goes to move away from me.

He thinks he's in safety because the knees are moving further and further away. He's moving away. He's all the way into my grip, almost gone, and yet it means nothing.

I can start to draw him in. As I draw him in, I put my foot to the inside position and I bring him right back into position where I can go on the attack. As he comes in, I like always in these circumstances to pass my foot over and switch my arms.

I keep my body high and as a result, we can make switches up into another one of our systems, the reverse-Ashi-Urami. Of course, on reverse-Ashi-Urami, we know what our opponent wants to do. He'll lock up his legs defensively.

We've seen it from situations like this. It's not difficult for us to fall down to the floor and go in to attack our opponent's leg. He goes to kick out and gives us the second leg for a kneebar win.

You can see there's a sense here in which your opponent can only escape one leg by exposing the other. The legs are so close to each other that it almost always means whenever I lose one leg, the other one is there for the taking. This creates incredible opportunities to get these simple dilemmas to work in your favour anytime you feel you're losing legs.

Here, we have a straight-Ashi-Urami situation. I feel Kama-Sara is doing a good job of pushing the foot down and starting to spread over my legs. As he comes in over my legs, there's always going to be exposure on the second leg.

From here, I can draw my training partner in towards me and I can go into an Ashi-Urami on the straight-Ashi-Urami on the second leg, or I can keep the scoop grip and from here, spin around my training partner here and go across-Ashi-Urami on the second leg. Your choice. Always bear in mind you've got two legs in front of you, not one.

So many athletes grab a hold of one leg and they get a tunnel vision where all they see is the leg in front of them. Never forget, he's got two legs. They're right next to each other.

If you lose one, just go to the other leg. Your best friend in any of these exchanges is the so-called scoop grip, which means that no matter how far your opponent gets away from you, you can always draw him back to you with minimal effort. No matter how many times he moves away, it's the easiest thing to bring him back.

So as I feel my opponent breaking my Ashi-Urami and stepping over the top, it's an easy thing for me to thread back into the second leg. It's easy because the two legs are right next to each other. I can work from here.

Let's look at one simple example. I lose Ashi-Urami on my partner's left leg. Then on the right, from here, we roll through and end up in a breaking position on the second leg.

This is another sense in which we can create simple dilemmas in almost any given leg lock situation. Not so much by a technical element, it's just a mental element of identifying the simple fact that the two legs are right next to each other. Whenever one escapes, the second is there for the taking.

We've gone over a large amount of theory with regards to the various elements of the general and subsystems that make up the entire leg lock system. It's time now to get into practical applications. Movements that we often use in training and competition to enter into the legs and to get to a decisive winning position.

In truth, I could sit here for months and show you a thousand different entries. What I want to do is to give you, in a practical sense, a sampler of ways to enter in practical fashions into leg locks from standing position, from ground positions on bottom, ground positions on top, and from a so-called double seated position where both assets are sitting down in front of each other. I can't show you the entire library of moves that we use in this position.

It simply wouldn't fit on any DVD series. But what I can do is show you some of the more practical ones which we use every day in training and use them to illustrate some of the concepts and tactics and insights which you can then employ in other areas in these four different contexts yourselves. Let's look now at one of my favourite ways to enter into the legs from standing position.

(1:01:58 - 1:05:33)
This particular method gained considerable attention when it was used very, very successfully by Gary Tonin in a spectacular battle of leg locking expertise between himself and the great Kuzma Palyaris. My concern as a coach when Gary went to fight Palyaris was the enormous discrepancy in size and strength. Palyaris is not only a very good leg locker, he's also very good at takedowns, especially lifting, slamming takedowns.

And one of my concerns was that if Gary got into upper body tie-ups with Mr. Palyaris, he would come off second best every single time. So I taught him what we call the sliding ashigurami entry, where from no tie-up whatsoever, neither athlete has a grip on the other, you slide into your legs. This is the equivalent in jiu-jitsu leg locking terms of a shot in wrestling, where you have no tie-up and you shoot from a distance for a takedown.

The grip we use is similar to a high crotch, but the end result is obviously very, very different. From a situation standing where I notice my opponent has his right foot forward and I also have my right foot forward, okay, so we have the same lead foot. I come off my training partner and I start by putting my head down just above the height of my training partner's hips.

I don't care if he stays high or if he comes down with me, it's going to make no difference, okay. The distance that I work with here is usually at a distance where I have hands on my training partner and I take a step and with a step I'll be able to reach the inside of my training partner's lead knee, okay. When I make my step, my chest comes down towards my lead leg, similar to a shot, but rather than shoot towards my knees, ultimately I want to shoot down onto my hips.

So what I'm going to do is I'm going to reach and I'm going to catch at my training partner's knee. How you catch is extremely important. I want to catch the whole tendon on the inside of the back of my training partner's knee, so my hand locks like so.

Make sure your fingers are together for a strong grip. I come in and there's the initial catch. When Kamosara goes to pull his leg back, it's shockingly difficult.

Now all I do is I put my hand right in front of my training partner's toes. As the hand catches the knee and the hand catches the toes, I now get an ability to slide. When I make that slide, I don't want to slide onto my back, I want to slide onto my side.

I have to make sure that I present enough space between our two feet that my hips can slide through that space. I don't want to step too close to my opponent's foot. Now there's no space for me to slide through.

So for an initial situation with my training partner, I come up to my right foot forward, often I'll post with my other hand. When I measure distance with my post hand, now I step onto my training partner's centre line. Off that step, the two hands catch and I slide onto my hip.

As I do that, I pull him forward onto me. Now we're in the perfect position, blocking the foot to throw our legs straight up into the ashi garami. As always, I look at my opponent's head.

If my opponent goes to a step in this direction, we attack, block and finish with outside ashi garami. I move down. From here, you can clearly see my training partner's centre line.

(1:05:33 - 1:06:45)
I step to the centre line. I use a post hand to enable me to get there. Now penetration step and a catch.

My chest goes down to catch, plant, watch my hip, I slide onto my side. I do not go onto my back. Then when I pull, he gets mounted.

Obviously that's not what we want. I pull in such a way that my head is outside his leg, so that when I pull, his body goes across me, not on top of me. Now from here, I throw my legs.

I look at his reaction. If the head moves away, we go ahead. If the head moves towards, we block, lift and put him down.

Once again, a sliding ashi garami shot. I move towards my training partner I post, I step to the centre line. Off the centre line, I level change, I go in, catch, pull and my legs go in.

(1:06:48 - 1:07:08)
And we've got the finish. We're looking at practical applications entering into various ashi garami from standing position. We just saw one very, very effective method that didn't involve tying up with our opponent.

(1:07:09 - 1:07:24)
Nonetheless, most of the time when we go to enter our opponent's legs from standing position, it involves some kind of tie-up. Probably the single most common form of tie-up in both wrestling and jiu-jitsu is collar ties. Whether they're initiated by us or by someone else.

(1:07:25 - 1:08:19)
When the kamasara comes out in collar ties, most of the time, I don't like to see athletes working with neutral collar ties, where he has a collar tie and me and I have a collar tie. It's kind of a neutral position where it's difficult to get through a takedown, so we essentially have the same grip on each other. I much prefer to see asymmetrical grips where we have different grips upon each other.

Nonetheless, for the purpose of entering the legs, both of us having a collar tie at the same time is not a bad thing. In fact, it can actually be quite useful. What we'll do here is take an opponent with his feet apart, like so.

We're going to take our opponent's leg and square him up to us. What I don't want is kamasara reaching for my legs as I'm trying to get my game going here. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get a hold of my opponent's tricep and hold, so that I know he can't use his right arm to reach for my legs as I'm underneath it.

(1:08:19 - 1:10:34)
If he's going to reach for my legs, it's going to have to be the other arm. Now, I'm going to square my opponent up to us by circling away from the far leg and pulling. So I step, circle, and pull.

So I square my training partner up. Now, from this situation, I want to step in so that I get the inside position with my right foot. Once my right foot attains the inside position, we're ready to go.

The only impediment is going to be my opponent's collar tie inside like this. So we need an effective method of clearing this hand off. How are we going to do this? When my opponent has the collar tie, I'm going to put my hand inside like so.

So my hand comes in. If my opponent is strong, I will not be able to simply pull the hand off. So what I need to do is to walk away from my opponent's arm.

So I move and walk, and now the arm is clear. Now, I circle and pull my training partner up. I'm in the perfect position now to step my foot inside his, and then I fall not towards the leg that I want to attack, but I point my leg across the second leg like so.

Watch as I fall. My leg goes in this direction. I never want to fall underneath my opponent.

I want to fall out to the side at an angle so that my head is outside his leg. That is an incredibly important detail. Now from here, I throw my legs up into the ashi garami, and as always from here, it's the same principle.

I look at his head. If the head moves away, the heel will be exposed, and we go into a straight ashi garami system. If my opponent squares up to me, we put a cross buttock position, foot in place, and from here, we lift and drop our opponent down into the cross ashi system.

Either way, we're in a winning position. Let's have a look at this again. We have an opponent.

He comes out and walks up with karate. I don't want a situation where we both have the same grip, so I'm going to put my hand in, and I walk away from my training partner's karate. Now I'm in a perfect position to step and circle so I can get my foot in the inside position.

(1:10:35 - 1:11:21)
Now, retaining my grips, I do not grab the leg. I take my left leg across. I don't step in towards the leg that I want.

Watch the path and direction of my left leg. It goes outwards so that I never fall underneath my opponent. Now my legs fire up, but he tries to work from here.

How I go to work will always depend on the direction of my opponent, which will be told to me by the direction his head is moving. Here, Kamosawa is elected to come into me. That means it makes more sense for me to go into the cross ashi gurami system.

So we start an action of lifting and getting our opponent out of balance. We take our second foot, thread through and around our leg, and drop him down to the mat. Let's have a look at how this movement goes along.

(1:11:22 - 1:14:05)
The single most common mistake I see is people do a good job of squashing a man up, but then they fall underneath their opponent and get squashed. The mistake they made is they fell with their head and shoulders inside their opponent's legs. That's not what we want.

We want to fall in such a way that my hip is outside the legs and I wind up across his body, not inside his legs, where if he falls, he tends to fall on top of me. So from a standing start, we tie it up. I clear my training partner down, I square him up.

I sit in on my training partner and watch how he goes across and as a result, it's a relatively simple thing, put him up into a wing position. We're looking at some practical, simple standing entries into the leg lock, ashi gurami again, and standing position. Probably the single most common stance that my opponent takes is one where he's relatively bent over and the hands are in front of us like so.

This creates conditions where my opponent's hands are the part of my opponent's body that are closest to me. This makes it very natural in grappling situations for people to come up and start tying up the wrists as a first point of contact. It's very natural because the hands are the closest thing to me to do the first thing in that grappling.

Because of this, arm dragging has become a very, very useful and popular form of engaging in tie-ups and attack in the standing position of both wrestling and jiu-jitsu. Arm drags are not only a superb way of getting takedowns and taking your opponent's back, they're also a great way of entering into the legs. When my opponent's in here, I'm going to match my head level with his, I'm going to tie up my training partner at the wrists.

From here, I'm going to go in and drag on my training partner, but not with the intention of going into my opponent's legs for the takedown, but going into the legs for ashi gurami. What's required here is a penetration step, just like a takedown, a grip on my training partner's leg, just like a takedown, but a very different finish. The arm drag gives me the perfect angle to shoot past my opponent's far leg.

Remember, everything goes past and behind the far leg. From here, I grip the leg and I shoot through, use the drag to get the perfect attacking angle on my training partner. As always, my intention is to get my head outside my opponent's leg.

(1:14:05 - 1:15:31)
As a result, I can quickly fire up into the ashi gurami position. From here, I track my opponent's head, it moves away, the heel will be exposed, and we go into a winning position. Remember, our ultimate goal is always to get our head outside our opponent's leg.

If I fall in between my opponent's legs, there's a real danger of pulling him into bad positions. Okay, you are going into a bad guard fold. So it's very, very important I fall across my opponent's body, where his body weight goes across mine as opposed to on top of mine.

That means anytime his body goes across, it's the easiest thing in the world for me to go into a variation of ashi gurami in a winning position. The arm drag makes this particularly easy because it opens a direct door to the space behind his back leg. In a situation where he's bent over like so, I go in, that's the direction I want, right past the back leg.

When I catch, look how my leg goes straight towards the back leg. That gives me the perfect attacking angle to lock up. This time, the problem is how I turn is the facing, so I put the cross body hook in, lift, catch, and draw.


## Volume 7

(0:03 - 0:22)
Another very very effective form of entry into the legs from standing position comes out of any front headlock situation. The front headlock is one of the absolute most versatile attacking methods of standing on the ground in the entire sport. It's also an excellent avenue into our opponent's legs.

(0:23 - 1:26)
The setup we use can be any way you choose, there's a thousand. I'll demonstrate it out an underhook situation like so. From any given underhook my head dominates the inside position of my training partner's ear and as a result I'm able to take a hand and bring my training partner's head down and lock up on my training partner to go into a front headlock.

Once again, in a standing situation I pull into an initial underhook. I put my head in a good attacking position and then from here I bring my hand up, it comes down and as a result we're in a nice front headlock. From any front headlock situation regardless of how you get down, if my opponent comes up off the floor with his hands it's always possible for us to put our knee down and our head behind our training partner's arm.

So when he goes to yank out it's extremely difficult. This makes it very easy for me to go across to my opponent's thigh ankle and pick the ankle just like so. Now I put pressure on the head and my second knee goes down to the mat.

(1:27 - 1:51)
As a result we can post the floor and bring our knee in just like so. My hand transfers to my training partner's knee, my foot comes up, as a result we end up in a perfectly attacking position in our training partner's legs. Once again, from any given setup, it doesn't matter which one, it's better to get a hold of our training partner as he comes up off the floor with his hand.

(1:51 - 3:13)
I go in towards my training partner's thigh ankle. From here I go across and catch. We bring our training partner's leg up, catch the knee, post, my foot comes up and across and we end up in a perfectly attacking position down on the floor.

Now, one of the interesting things about standing positions is we can often enter the legs in what are apparently disadvantageous positions. If I'm standing and my opponent is going behind me and has a standing rear body lock, from a standing rear body lock we can enter our training partner's legs. Whenever I'm in a standing rear body lock I never want to be bolted up wide and square to my training partner.

Always in these situations I want to be controlling my training partner's hands and coming out with a hip so that I'm turning more or less side on to my opponent rather than presenting my whole back to my opponent. From here with high hips and an exposed back it's very easy for my opponent to lift me etc. So always from in here we turn the hip out and I push the hands in towards my training partner's hip.

As a result I can start to lower my level and step my foot to the inside position. Now we do something similar to a standing switch. We bring our free hand through and catch our training partner with the knee.

(3:14 - 4:04)
Then from here I'm going to post my hand to the floor, I'm going to put my head outside his leg and pull my training partner around the corner and end up in the perfect Ashigarami situation. From here Kamosara goes to square himself up to me, so I go to cross-thighter position, lift and drop him down to the mat. Once again with a standing rear body lock, dominate the hands and turn.

Even if the hands stay locked it doesn't matter. We turn from here, my arm goes in behind my training partner's tricep above the elbow, make sure we're down here below the elbow. I go through and catch because my foot has the inside position it means a turn, post and pull always brings him past us.

(4:05 - 6:59)
As a result we can roll through and end up in a winning position. We're looking at some practical ways to interrupt an opponent's legs in scenarios that occur all the time in your daily training. We're looking first at the standing position.

One of our favourite ways to enter into the legs from standing position is to go into an initial takedown where the takedown stalls usually because your opponent goes into some kind of partial stall or some other form of resistance. Whenever we feel completing the takedown is going to be more potentially dangerous than whatever benefit we gain from it, a good idea is to sit back and to arch the ground. Let's look at a classic example, a takedown which is used every single day in every academy across the nation, a double leg takedown.

In a situation where Kawamasaura has hands on me like so, we're going to go into an arm pull double where I take my body, I stand on my training partner's standing line, I level change and from here I throw my training partner's two elbows behind me and I go into my training partner's legs. Because my body is relatively upright in this position, this is usually a strong finishing position. Now typically if I go to finish a double leg, I'll stand up on the side that my head is on so that I can rise up off the floor or turn the corner etc.

That's the typical pattern involved in finishing double leg. Whenever I feel my opponent hips in and I can't get that initial finish, an excellent way to finish this is not with a takedown but an entry into the legs. So once again if my opponent has hands on my body, I go through and I take double tricep grips.

From that initial position there's an initial level change, my two feet coming together and then off the level change we get a strong entry into the legs. From here I see a partial sprawl by my training partner and now finishing is going to be difficult. Instead of putting the outside leg up for a takedown, I'm going to put the inside leg up for an ashi sit.

My hand comes down to my training partner's knee on this side. I go elbow deep around my training partner's knee and my head slides from hip to knee. We've already said that the key to sitting to ashi garami is to get my head outside of my opponent's legs.

That's exactly what I'm doing now. Off this motion watch my left leg slide towards my right foot and as a result we're directly into the ashi garami again. As always I look at my opponent's head.

If the head moves away, straight ashi garamis. If the head moves towards me, cross ashi garamis. Once again from a standing position.

(7:01 - 8:54)
As the rest of the standing position I come in, there's an initial level change, there's a pull that puts me into the legs. There's a partial sprawl that tells me it's going to be difficult to finish. Instead of going conventionally outside leg up, we go inside leg up.

As inside leg goes up, head goes out. As the head goes out, I fall around the corner going to the ashi slide. Now we're in perfect position to enter the legs.

We're looking at the idea of entering into our opponent's legs in standing situations. One of our favourite ways of going into the legs is out of any single leg attempt. If I have an opponent standing with his right foot forward and I'm standing left footed against them.

This is a classic example of a situation where I can go into my training partner's legs. One of our favourite ways to work here is with a knee pull single where I use a pull on my training partner's knee to draw my training partner forward. Unfortunately I can't demonstrate on this side because of my hip replacement.

From a situation where I tie up with my training partner, it's like so. We're going to go down, we're going to go in and control our training partner from the inside. As a result, I'm able to pull on the knee and bring my own knee around the corner and go straight away into my training partner's legs.

We're always looking at these situations where Benji's leg is stepping away from me. The knee pull is designed to do exactly that. As I draw down on my training partner, I go and I catch my training partner at the knee.

When he goes to pull back, it's a shocking difficult thing to do. Now my hand goes down, I go all the way around my training partner's leg and catch into my training partner's legs. Ideally, I'd love to catch my training partner's leg in front of me, but I'd be a liar if I said that happens all the time.

(8:55 - 9:20)
Very often what will happen is we'll get into single leg situations down on the mat and he'll go into a sprawl with a wisdom and we won't be able to control the leg adequately. In these situations, as the leg goes back, we're going to post our hand down on the mat and put our foot inside our training partner's shoelaces, just like so. I have a basic support with the hand, a good grip around our training partner's leg and inside position with my left foot.

(9:20 - 9:38)
Even when he goes into a full sprawl, I can hold it because of my action of the hand on the mat. If I didn't have that hand on the mat and he went into a full sprawl, I'd quickly get flabbed out underneath my opponent. But when I see that sprawl go on, I post, I put my foot in just like so.

(9:38 - 10:06)
Now I'm going to go into a knee slide. As always, we slide towards the other leg so that my head starts to come out. I bring my leg underneath and I draw him straight past us and into the ashi garami position.

As always, we look at his head. If the head moves away, the heel will be exposed. If he protects the heel by bringing the head forwards, he'll expose the second leg and to cross ashi garami.

(10:09 - 10:41)
So, from a single leg situation, bring in, I feel weight in this sprawl, I post on the floor, I put my foot in and I slide towards the opposite leg. As a result, we can lift up into the ashi garami situation and then go into winning positions. We're looking at practical ways to go into our training partner's legs in four main scenarios.

(10:42 - 11:16)
Standing position, ground on top, ground on bottom and double seated position. Probably the single most common means of entering into the legs used by my students, myself, everyone who's ever been coached by me, is to enter into the legs from the bottom position. There's a reason for this.

Whenever we have two athletes in front of each other, one is on two knees and one is in one position. Let's understand something here. When Bernardo Faria goes to wrestle from this position, he can wrestle with four legs.

(11:16 - 11:43)
Two legs and two arms. Karl Saro, on the other hand, is largely limited to passing with two arms. Why? Because the majority of the work done by his legs is weight bearing.

He has to stay in the top position. Because of this, most of his manipulations are done through the upper body, but Bernardo can manipulate through legs and arms together. It's essentially a four versus two situation.

(11:43 - 12:13)
Moreover, the strength of Bernardo's legs is vastly greater than the strength of Karl's arms. So even though on the face of it you're in bottom position, most people think this is inferior, there are a huge number of advantages to being the bottom player in these situations. You have four limbs to work with instead of two and you are inherently stable because you are either on your buttocks or your back.

Karl Saro, on the other hand, is only as stable as the base of support underneath him. In this case, it's two knees. If he stands up, it's two feet.

(12:15 - 12:51)
So Bernardo can play a Kazushi-based game and disrupt Karl's balance as he goes to stand and kneel in front of him. But there's not really a Kazushi-based game for Karl to play on Bernardo. It's kind of an asymmetry game.

Considerations like this led me to believe this is one of the absolute best scenarios to go into and start hunting for our opponent's legs. What we need is a strong sense of what we call Kazushi, or off-balancing. Now, let's look at the idea of entering into our opponent's legs from bottom position.

(12:52 - 15:13)
This is where the overwhelming majority of our entries into our opponent's legs come from in competition and training. Let's look at the first, the most fundamental, and in my opinion the most important one to learn. This is the idea of elevating our opponent and entering into our opponent's legs.

What's the problem we're dealing with? The problem is that my opponent has deliberately shortened his legs by putting his knees on the mat. As long as the knees are on the mat, it's extremely difficult for me to get into most forms of Rimi-Ashi-Gurami. So what we need is to elevate our opponent so those knees start coming off the floor.

The question is, how are you going to do this on someone who doesn't want to be elevated? Let's look first at what's going to make it difficult for me to elevate somebody. The most obvious thing here is head position. If my opponent's head is below my shoulders, it's extremely hard for me to elevate my opponent.

Even if I had solid grips in this position, when the head is below my front deltoid, elevation is always extremely difficult. That's why many experienced guard players, when they first go to enter into Butterfly Guard sitting down, will first establish an inside position with their knee, and the next thing they do is they work with their head at the front deltoid. By putting one knee in the centre, I've cut down my opponent's ability to elevate me in half.

By putting my head in like so, when my opponent goes to elevate me, it's almost impossible. It's easier to put my opponent's shoulders down to the mat. Obviously, I don't want that happening.

So I've got to be careful to maintain an inside position with both feet. I do that by cocking my feet. I don't just have two dead feet sitting inside my opponent's knees.

They are actively hooking inside my training partner's knees, like so. So if he goes to step with me inside, my legs follow him at all times. I don't just have my feet inactive.

He puts his knee inside, and now he's stolen an inside position from me. So with cocked feet, the next thing is I'll never let his head come down like so, into a dominating position in my shoulder. How do I stop that from happening? I always keep thumb posts inside my training partner's biceps.

So if he goes to drive forward on my training partner, I keep my head below his. I can't be naive in the way I do this. I can't just put my head forward and he'll snap me down into a front hip up and cause problems for me.

(15:14 - 16:41)
So I make sure I do it behind the safety of thumb posts. So when he goes to snap my head down, it's not going to hurt. You're dominating the inside of his arms.

Now, I make sure my head position goes to his clavicles. So when he goes to get underneath my head and shoulders, it's not going to happen. Now, from this situation, my hands pommel through.

One, two, and we're in the perfect position to go. A skill that you must develop as an athlete is the skill of moving your body weight forward from a seated position without the use of your hands and arms. I should, at all times, be able to use my feet digging into the mat to pull my body towards my own heels without the use of my hands.

If I cannot do this, this is going to cause a lot of problems in the elevation game. The good news is it's a pretty simple skill. It doesn't take a lot of strength.

The way we do it is not by putting our soles of the foot on the floor. You will not be able to pull yourself successfully. We use the blade of the foot, the sole of the foot, to pull that means my toes point outwards, my head is forward, and my two feet work in unison to pull my butt to my heels.

And in this way, I can cover distance and move towards my opponent. My task is to put my centre of gravity underneath my opponent's centre of gravity. Now, you might be asking, where the hell is my opponent's centre of gravity? Well, that's very easy.

(16:41 - 16:58)
Your opponent's centre of gravity is located two inches below his navel, and so is yours. My job is to put my centre of gravity directly under his, or at the very least, as close as possible to it. The further my centre of gravity is from his, the harder he will be to elevate.

(17:00 - 17:44)
So when I work with Kawasara, my first thing is to prevent him getting good head position. So I take inside posts, and I get my own head position. Now, from here, I pull in one, I pull in two.

Watch my hips. There's his centre of gravity, here's mine. I need to move my centre of gravity forward using just my feet.

If I put my hands on the ground to move forward, I've just lost my upper body grip. I have no grip on him. So I have to do this using only my feet.

Watch as I go in, and we take him up into the air. My whole goal is to put his hands on the floor. Once his hands touch the mat, I'm going to find a way to get through to my training partner's legs.

(17:45 - 18:24)
This is the basis behind the elevation game, with two feet inside. Let's have a quick review of what we went over. First, I can't have my opponent's steel inside position.

If he does that, automatically lost 50% of my elevating power. So when I hook inside, my feet are not just in inside position, they are controlling the inside position. That means I can use my feet to prevent my opponent's knees coming closer together.

When he goes to palm his feet and knees inside, I'm controlling him from the inside. Now when I break contact, I steal the head position from him, so he can't get underneath my head. Now I go in, I get grips on my training partner.

(18:24 - 19:08)
I use my feet to pull my centre of gravity to his, and as a result, we effortlessly get him up into the air. Now, most of Tom Sara's weight is going through his hands. It looks like I'm holding him up, but really I'm not.

I'm only doing a small percentage of the work. Most of the work is being done by his upper body holding himself on the floor, and as a result, I can easily move my opponent around in this position in ways that will set up a leg lock game. Now, we're spending some time on the idea of elevation into Ashi Garami from bottom position.

(19:10 - 20:08)
The single most important thing that I can teach, I can sit here all day and teach you large numbers of elevation entries into various forms of Ashi Garami, but the single most important thing that I can teach you is conceptual. There are three characteristics of a successful elevation into any form of Ashi Garami, whether it be straight or cross, that you must master and understand. The first is hips overhead.

This is absolutely critical to your success when you go to elevate someone and you want to put them into the Ashi Garami game. Most of the failures to work from bottom position to elevate your opponent and get them into a successful leg lock stem from a failure to get your opponent's hips directly overhead. The second key element is perpendicularity.

(20:08 - 20:44)
You have to get your hips and upper body 90 degrees or more to your opponent's hips and upper body. This too is absolutely critical. When I start off with an opponent, typically we're lined up with each other, but by the time I elevate and enter my opponent's legs, I want to be at least 90 degrees to their body and hopefully more than that.

That's the second key element. The third key element is knee position. My knee must dominate the space inside my opponent's head.

(20:44 - 21:59)
That is absolutely critical because it will determine how you control your opponent after the elevation. So there's three absolutely critical elements. Every good elevation into an Ashi Garami has all three.

Their hips must be overhead. Your knee must dominate the area inside the pocket of their hip and you must be at least 90 degrees to their hips. There has to be an angle that you work with.

These three elements form a holy trinity that creates success when you go to elevate people in the bottom Ashi Garami game. This is true regardless of whether you go for straight Ashi Garami finishes or cross Ashi Garami finishes. Let's look at some common sense examples here.

Let's say I have an opponent and I go into even basic elevation. When I first put the man up, you can clearly see his hips are not over my head and as a result, the partner crosses his feet. It's almost impossible for me to successfully get into an Ashi Garami.

All that changes when I bring his hips directly over my head. Now it's the easiest thing in the world to punch my leg through. However, I'm lined up with my training partner.

(22:00 - 23:20)
If I punch my leg through while I'm lined up, a skilful opponent can still block the Ashi Garami. What I need is angle. So what we typically do is take a cross frame.

My right hand goes from one side of the body to the other. As a result, I can spin 90 degrees in an instant. Now I have a perfect attacking angle.

You will notice that my knee dominates the inside of his hip here. So when he goes to turn back and face me, he slows down. And more importantly, even as he turns back, I have the critical cross body position, which means a dilemma between straight Ashi Garami attacks and cross Ashi Garami attacks.

Let's look at how the same three set of principles, hips over head, perpendicular angle, and domination of the knee inside the hip, occur not only in straight Ashi Garami increase, but cross Ashi Garami increase. From a situation where Kyle is on two knees and I have a single foot inside, I place my second foot outside my training partner's thigh, just like so. So my legs form the shape of an X around my training partner's quadricep on one side of the body.

(23:22 - 24:30)
From here, I put an arm around my training partner's body like so. My second hand dominates the outside of the leg. As always, I pour across the body.

So I catch here and here. Watch my left knee. I punch the left knee behind my training partner's hamstring, so that my centre of gravity goes directly under his.

Now my whole thing is to get his hips directly over my head. I've already got angle. The next thing is elevation, where his hips come over my head.

I'm even turning beyond 90 degrees in many cases. Now from here, my knee dominates the inside of my training partner's hip. So once again, we have the three most important elements.

My knee dominates the space inside his hip. His hips report directly over my head, and we've formed at least a 90 degree angle, and in many cases, even more. If I can get these three details correct, I can almost always elevate someone up into here, and into either a cross-axis ground, or a straight-axis ground.

(24:31 - 28:28)
If I fail with any one of those three, I will almost certainly fail in the project overall. We've been looking at the idea of entering into our training partner's legs from butterfly guard. So far, we've been looking at situations where he's down on two knees.

Because he's on two knees, we needed to elevate our opponent, get his knees off the mat, and create extension in his legs, so that we could enter into various forms of ashi garami, usually either a cross-axi garami, or a straight-axi garami. Now, things start to change when our opponent starts taking knees off the mat. Once your opponent takes knees off the mat, elevation is no longer important, because the legs are already extended, and as a result, you can start going directly into the leg-locking game.

Let's look at a situation, for example, where my training partner has two knees down, and I go into an arm drag from this situation. If I hit an arm drag on an opponent, and he doesn't react, just stays on two knees, he's got a slight disclosure, and as a result, I've got to pull into him now to start going to my opponent's back. Your opponents know that, and so when I go to arm drag on this side, an intelligent thing for him to do is to put up his leg on the same side that I've dragged.

When that happens, his hips are now higher than my hips, so if I turn towards his back, he can easily step over my hips, and start causing problems for me. So it's not a bad reaction on his part. It gives him the advantage of height with his hips, and an ability to prevent back exposure, and get back and recover from the arm drag.

However, it does set up a very easy entry into our training partner's legs. From a situation where I get the drag, and I see my training partner step up, I'm going to go elbow deep around my training partner's leg, and put my feet inside my training partner's steps. As a result, we can take our training partner directly up and over, because both his right leg and right arm are held tight in front of me.

As a result, I can take my opponent up and over, and in a situation where you can immediately drop him down into a cross-archery ground. Once again, for an initial catch on our training partner, he goes to put his leg up, we go elbow deep around the leg like so. I use my two feet to pull my centre of gravity under his, and then I use an elevator to lift, extend my opponent up into the air, and now it's a simple catch.

The knee goes inside of the hip, and he goes straight down to the mat. One more time, for an initial situation down on the floor, I hit an arm drag and my opponent's knee comes off the mat. That's creating an extension, and as a result, it's an easy thing for me to get a hold of my training partner's legs, lift, and drop.

We've seen that whenever we want to play the Ashigurami game from butterfly guard, the first thing we do is we look at our training partner's legs. If the knees are on the floor, I need to engage in some form of elevation in order to enter into Ashigurami, but if knees start coming off the mat, I can go directly into various forms of Ashigurami without so much need for elevation. Very often, you'll have an opponent who's working with a passer guard, and they'll just post the leg.

Unfortunately for my opponent, he's posted in such a way that he's given me inside position with my feet. So from here, I'm going to go through and take a two-on-one grip on my training partner's leg. My intention is to get my knee behind his knee.

Very often, I see people make a common mistake here. They try to pull legs towards them. A strong athlete pushes on my shoulders, and I can never pull the leg in.

(28:28 - 29:42)
I don't pull his leg towards me with my hands. I use my hands to pull my knee behind his knee. When he pushes on me, I just pull, and I get my knee behind him.

What brings him to me is not my hands, it's my knee. No matter how strongly he pushes on me, my knee easily draws my training partner forward. Now I have a choice.

I look at my opponent's head. If the head moves away, we know what to do. We go into an Ashi Garandi roll.

Step on the other hand. We catch, and I see my training partner try to turn towards me. This is the time for us to thread the leg through and drop our training partner into the Cross Ashi Garandi.

Once again, we have an opponent in front of us. I see him post the leg. Immediately, I take a two-on-one grip.

The purpose of the two-on-one is not to pull my opponent's leg. It's to pull my knee behind his knee. Once my knee goes in behind, even with no hands, the knee will draw him in.

(29:43 - 30:55)
From here, I look at my opponent, and I assess where I want to take him. It'll be the sooner, as we know, my head position. Most of your opponents are going to try and turn and face you so that they can hide their heel.

If the head moves away, they'll always expose their heel to my attacks. We go cross buttock with the foot. The second foot comes around, knees to chest, brings his hips directly over my knee.

I have a 90-degree angle to my training partner. As a result, we're ready to go. I pull, watch my inside knee dominate the inside of his hip.

As a result, we can easily drop the man down to the floor. We satisfied all three of the parameters of success in elevation. We've got the hips over the head, we've got the 90-degree angle, and our knee dominated the space inside the head.

We looked at the idea of entering into our training partner's legs from bottom position. We've seen the method of entry is largely determined by the state that my opponent's legs are in. If the knees are on the mat, it's going to require some form of elevation to create extension in his legs so I can get into an ashi garami.

(30:55 - 32:07)
Once my opponent's knees start leaving the mat, now I can go directly into ashi garami with less extension, sorry, with less elevation. I might still use elevation to off-balance people, but there's already an extended leg so I can start going into the ashi garami a little easier. When my opponent stands over me, a big question here is can I work my way into inside position? If he's in a stance and stepping his feet to the inside, it's going to be hard for me to enter ashi garami if he dominates the inside position with his lead leg.

Something I want to consistently get into the habit of is the idea of protecting that inside space between my knees. When I have an opponent in front of me, I will often position my feet across my training partner's lead foot. Once my foot goes across the lead foot, I use my second foot to pull my body forward so that I get closer to my opponent.

So my first thing is to protect the space between my knees. I bring my foot across my training partner's foot to the inside position, then I bring my second leg in place and I use the blades of my feet to pull myself to my opponent. Now I get my shoelaces to his shoelaces and I immediately go out and I go wrist deep around my training partner's knee.

(32:07 - 34:29)
Don't grab finger deep. The idea is I want to go with a palm down grip, wrist deep around the leg. Commonly I see people gripping with the palm more or less pointing to the wall and fingers around the leg.

This will not be sufficient. I want to block the lead leg. I go wrist deep, palm down and as a result I get a good ability to take people out of balance.

Presumably he's going to have his leg back and working like so. He's probably getting his hands posted on the other body etc. So once again, I will establish contact on a standing opponent.

First I've got to protect the space between my knees. When I see him aggressively coming in towards me, I want to make sure I guard that space. Now I want to get closer to him so I use my feet to draw my body closer.

I get an effective grip by going palm down, wrist deep and locking around my training partner's leg. As a result, I can put a hand on the floor and start moving my training partner and manipulating his step. Every time he goes a step away from me, I can easily make his foot come towards me just by pulling my left hand towards my right.

I can manipulate where and when he steps just by this interaction. Every time he steps back and away, I can make that man step at will. Not only can I make my opponent step, in many ways I can off-balance, I can catch his foot mid-step, I can catch his foot in various forms of ushi around me etc.

Once again, I start by blocking the inside space, moving towards my opponent and locking up on my training partner. From here, there are so many ways for us to go on the attack. One of my favourite is to put weight on this leg by getting my opponent to step with it.

I get my opponent to step, most of the weight is now on this leg. That's going to make it very easy for me to chop the inside of my opponent's leg and then from here calibrate the second leg. As a result, we can fire off an ushi garomi on either one of my training partner's legs.

As always, I look at my opponent's head to assess which way I want to grab. Most of the opponent is going to be looking to square up. As a result, it's a good time for me to use that cross-body elevator to get our opponent up, bring my second foot through and around, bring his head towards my head and drop my opponent to the floor.

Once again, my opponent starts in front of me. As he goes to move forward, I make sure I guard the inside space. I move towards my training partner and lock up.

(34:29 - 35:10)
I want to attack the knee leg, so I put the weight on this leg. Now, I go inside, I turn to an angle, lifting, elevating and bringing my legs up until I actually go around him. From here, there are so many ways for us to work.

Probably the one we use most in competition is to thread our legs, swirl it around, knees to chest, lift and drop. We're looking at that here, entering into our training partner's legs when the knees start coming off the mat from a seated position. We've seen that it's our desire to always defend the space between our knees.

(35:10 - 36:29)
When our opponent starts stepping in towards me, that's good for him, bad for me. Once he gets his feet up to my knee line, it's hard for me now to start recovering inside position. So, whenever I see someone aggressively coming towards me, my first thing is always to cover the space between my knees and ensure that I get inside position with my feet.

Now, I can't just stay here. My opponent will eventually palm his foot back into inside position. So, once I've taken inside position, I need to now maintain it.

We do that by putting our feet on the floor and bringing our body towards his using just our legs. Don't try to put hands on the mat and move towards people. Now, you have nothing to grip with.

I should be able to do this with my feet alone. As my feet pull me along the mat, I get ready to grip my training partner and come through and get a decisive grip around my training partner's leg. Now, I know I can make my opponent step at will in this position.

Why? Every time his foot goes back, no matter how far, it's the easiest thing in the world for me to put my hand on the floor and pull my left hand to my right. I know ahead of time he's going to have to take that step over to the other face of mine. We know that in the previous scene, we saw the idea of attacking the near leg.

Now, let's look at the idea of attacking the far leg. From the same position, it's very easy for me to get outside grip on my training partner and put my foot behind my training partner's far foot. Okay, so my foot goes from here to here.

(36:30 - 38:22)
Now, I just pull in on my training partner and my body shoots through, not into my opponent's centre line, but beyond the far leg. As a result, I can pull myself along the mat and find myself in the perfect attacking position to throw my legs and end up with a nice Ashigarami, both my opponent's legs controlled. When he goes to resist my Ashigarami sweep, he can't.

He has no place to control. As a result, he's quickly broken down to the mat in a position where it's relatively easy for me to expose my training partner's heel, start to apply pressure, put him into a cycle of blocks, which culminates in an outside Ashigarami and a breaking position. Once again, my opponent starts off in front of me.

As always from here, as he goes to move in towards me, I want to protect the inside space. From here, I move myself towards him just with the strength of my legs. We get a good grip on our training partner, hold him in, and I make that man take the step regardless of whether he wants to resist or not.

When I'm on the floor, left hand to right hand, you know he's taking that step. I catch the leg, reposition my foot behind his, and now I pull myself not through the centre, but underneath the leg that I want to attack. As a result, we end up in a perfect attacking position.

We fire up, keeping the second leg. When Kyle goes to resist the sweep from this position, look how difficult it is because both legs are being controlled. So we get a quick knockdown to the mat.

As always from here, we go inside Ashigarami to expose the heel. We block up, get our grips, transfer to the front of the Ashigarami, apply pressure, to finish this in an outside action, a strong breaking position. We're looking at that area featuring into our training partner's legs as they stand over us in a seated position.

(38:25 - 40:50)
We've seen that it's very much in our interest to protect the inside space, the space between our two knees. When I see an opponent moving aggressively forward, I always want to close that space. From that closed space, we establish contact with our foot locking behind our training partner's ankle.

Now I use my feet to draw myself close enough so I can get an effective working grip on my training partner and lock on, wrist deep around the knee blade. We're going to make a transition from the shin to shin guard to an X guard. We know that we can always manipulate our opponent's stepping patterns.

I don't care what he wants to do with his leg. He can step back as far as he wants. I can always force him to take a step forward.

It's almost like a magic trick. We can draw the foot towards our hand merely by pulling our left hand to our right. You can always step and step.

As a result, I can catch this time with a scoop grip on my training partner's leg. When I come through with the scoop grip, my wrist is bent 90 degrees. I go to throw and lock.

Don't be shallow with the hand. You need to go much further than wrist deep to this. I go elbow deep and lock.

As a result, it's an easy thing for me to reposition my right foot on the floor and use that as a turning point. Watch my left leg now. It goes in behind my training partner's knee.

Now, the right foot comes up in a conventional X guard position and the critical right knee behind my training partner's hamstring. The right knee is one of the key elements behind any successful use of X guard. It's the right knee which pushes behind my opponent's hamstring as my hips shift and my legs straighten and push the opponent's hands to the Once those hands go to the mat, it's the easiest thing in the world for me to switch from X guard to reverse X guard.

From reverse X guard, we start lifting our training partner up. We know what to do. We need hips overhead.

We need a 90 degree angle and we need our knee in the inside of our training partner's hip. As a result, we end up in a perfect breaking position. Let's have a look at all those details again.

We have an opponent in front of us. We know what he wants. He wants to dominate the inside space.

So, we close off the space between our knees. Legs in place like so. I move towards my training partner.

I make an initial contact with my foot. Off that initial contact, I draw my body in. Catch.

Good grip. No matter where he puts his foot, it's irrelevant. I pull my left hand to my right and I make him step wherever I want.

(40:50 - 43:25)
Now, I go in on my training partner's leg. How do I do this? By pushing my leg out. As one leg extends, I go elbow deep around my training partner's leg like so.

If I go in wrist deep, I'll never make a satisfactory connection on the X guard. Off the elbow deep entry, I hang, plant my foot and turn and my foot off-balances my training partner and makes him take a step. Now, the working leg goes in.

It puts a knee behind my training partner's hamstring, which will tilt my training partner forward and put his hands to the mat. Once the hands go to the mat, from here, I switch from X guard to reverse X guard. We know what the holy trinity is for getting someone elevated up into the legs.

Their hips have to come over our head. With hips overhead, now I want to turn at least 90 degrees. I've already done that.

The last thing is when I catch my opponent's legs, when I pull down, watch my left knee go into the pocket of his hip and put my opponent down into a leaning position. One of the things that I'm trying hard to push in this DVD series is that many of you already have strongly developed jiu-jitsu skills in other aspects of jiu-jitsu. A long-standing belief is that leg-locking, the ashi-gurama game, runs contrary to conventional jiu-jitsu.

That's a perception that I'm very much interested in changing. It's my belief that many highly talented athletes in the sport could easily add on the leg-locking game to their already existing skills and get great results in a very short period of time. The truth is, many of the already existent and well understood skills of the sport involve inside positioning.

These can easily be adapted into the leg-lock game so that someone who has good, strong, conventional skills within a very short time frame could become highly competent at leg-locking. A good example of this occurs with the well-known X-guard. My students are well known for using inside positioning, ashi-gurami, X-guard, but our primary interest with the X-guard is switching from conventional X-guards into reverse X-guards because it's from there that we can enter into our most devastating position across the ashi-gurami game.

(43:26 - 45:52)
Bernardo Faria is extremely adept at various forms of inside position X-guards, including X-guard. Let's look at how easy it is for him to go from conventional X-guard situations and with a slight modification into a reverse X-guard, suddenly find numerous opportunities for leg-lock entries. Bernardo is going to start from bottom position with his arm standing over him.

He's going to go immediately into what we call a basic ashi-gurami, what I believe Bernardo calls a single-leg X-guard. I'm going to make fun of it. He's going to do a single-leg X. Now, for any what he calls single-leg X, we call it a reverse ashi-gurami, he's going to thread his arm inside the shin and get a nice elbow-deep grip above the knee with his hand just like so.

And as a result, he can easily thread his legs now into an X-guard situation. Now, let's freeze right there. Let's understand exactly what happens with X-guards.

Bernardo is taking his right leg to his opponent's left knee. Right now, he's utilising what we call an open X-guard, where his knees are pointing in opposite directions out from each other. This has the advantage of putting his knee directly behind Kawamisaro's hamstring.

It means that if he pushes his hips to the left and pushes his knee to the right, he can easily off-balance someone down to the mat, coming back up high. A closed X-guard is where Bernardo closes his knees together. And now, with his knees pointing in the same direction, he can easily push the legs straight and get a result where the hands are pushed down to the mat, out and away.

He brings him back with the knees. Now, he goes back to an open X-guard, spreads his knees wide and drops his feet down to the ankle. He brings this one here up to the hip.

Now, he can off-balance Kawamisaro in a third direction, down to his hips and butt. Let's come back. Let's look at the extreme off-balancing potential of a conventional X-guard.

We'll start in Ashi-gurami. There's our starting position. This is the safest way to enter into the legs.

Once we've got the initial bite on the legs, we're going to make a quick transition into X-guard. Now, from here, three directions of off-balancing. Forwards, comes back up, out in front and straight backwards down to a butt.

(45:53 - 46:45)
Okay, so we've got three great ways to off-balance someone. Okay, coming back up. Let's look how easily Bonato can turn this into leg lock entries.

From the X-guard situation, first we want to make our opponent's hips as light as possible. Why? Because we know that we have to elevate those hips directly over our head. It's hard if we lift our opponent's entire body weight.

So, the first thing we do is we off-balance to get his hands to the floor. Now, Bonato is going to switch his feet. He's going to put what most people think is in a wrong X-guard, like so.

He's going to take his foot to what we call his right foot position. His right foot is going to go to his training partner's right buttock. Okay, so it goes across the centre line.

Okay, the second leg is going to go mid-thigh, just like so. Now, he's going to pull his knees to his chest. He's going to lift with his right hand.

(46:45 - 47:14)
And as a result, he can kick through and his hand is going to catch his training partner at the knee. Go back a step. Come, elevate your leg.

You're going to catch your training partner's knee and pull this hand assist. We are hand assisting, pulling the leg down and then he shoots and locks a triangle around the legs. Now, we're going to do a little experiment.

From here, Kamosada is going to make his base as strong as possible in this wheelbarrow position. Bonato, just push in that direction. And you see a little, it's certainly easy to knock your opponent down to the mat.

(47:14 - 47:27)
Now, his left arm is going to come out and lock an Achilles lock on this leg and he's going to hold Kamosada in place. Kyle is going to try to struggle out with him. In fact, it's almost impossible because of the strength of this laced leg Ashigurami.

(47:28 - 48:08)
That's an incredibly simple example of someone who has expertise in one area of the game, which is already known, well established and has been around for a long time, and within a matter of minutes can put on a nice performance into leg lock entries. Let's have a look at it again. So, let's start from here.

Start, Ashigurami situation. Then from here, he converts Ashigurami into X guard. Now, from here, controlling with one hand above the knee.

We don't need a second hand, but we put one hand above the knee. One hand will be fine. It gives us a free hand to work with.

(48:08 - 50:34)
And then from here, we're going to off balance and put our opponent's hands on the floor. So, generate some Kazushi. Now, this is significant.

Most of Kyle's weight is now borne through his hands. Kamosada is doing the work. That means that Bonato has very little work to do to start lifting and elevating.

He's only going to lift the weight of his opponent's legs as opposed to the whole body. Now, it's a quick switch into reverse X guard. That's easy.

You just have to switch one foot on top of the other. Nothing difficult about that. He's going to go to cross buttock position, where right foot goes to right buttock.

Now, the direction of the lift. First, knees to chest. Just stop when you go knees to chest.

Now, a common mistake is people try to lift straight up to the ceiling. It's never easy. Lift his leg towards my hand.

This is the so-called power curve, where you're lifting a curve out and away from your opponent. Much easier than lifting vertically upwards. Now, he's going to use a hand assist and pull the leg down and lock a triangle.

The inside Senkaku. Now, we know that if our knee dominates the space in front of our opponent's hips, it's the easiest thing in the world to use directionality and force and push along the line of the hips and look how effortlessly he puts him down, like a child. That's one excellent way to enter into the legs.

Let's go further than this. Starting again. One of the great virtues of X guards is one of the strongest ways of off-balancing people.

You can take a standing opponent and knock their hands down to the floor, their butt to the floor, etc. etc. We're going to make the transition from a Hachibirami into X guard.

Now, we see our opponent is doing everything possible to prevent hands going to the mat, okay? So, he's keeping a more upright posture. If Carl bends over, then it's so easy for Bernardo to put his hands in for an off-balancing. Carlos knows that and is resisting.

So, feeling that our opponent's energy is going backwards, Bernardo drops his foot to the ankle and knocks Carlos down to a fight. Good. Now, Bernardo is going to take his knee and spin over his opponent's hip and belt.

He's going to spin around the leg, come all the way up and face the other way. So, we're going to spin all the way around the leg. Good.

Keep going. Keep going. We're going to put our foot in centre and we're going to keep going.

Come up onto your elbow and put our legs in a nice turn. We've got a successful spin around the leg where he covers the toes and goes to an inverted or inside heel hook on his training partner and go into the legs. Let's have a look at this again.

(50:40 - 50:52)
So, we try to off-balance forward when we go to X guard. We try to off-balance and forward to the hands from the previous move, but Carlos is resisting. So, instead we off-balance straight back.

(50:53 - 51:16)
Now, we're going to post our hand on the mat. We're going to use that to spin all the way around our training partner's leg and lift and we're going to bring our knee a little bit forward on the side. Good.

Now, we're going to fall onto our hip and keep our shoulders off the mat. Good. We're going to put our foot inside.

We're going to slide our hips through so that we face our opponent. Good. We're going to tuck his heel through around, lock our hands and away we go.

(51:17 - 52:09)
A beautiful inside heel hook for the finish. In the space of just a few minutes, a great athlete has taken a position they already know very, very well and are very, very familiar with and they've added two very effective leg lock entries onto a skill set they're already very strong on. It took only a matter of minutes to learn and understand what they had to do.

Essentially, all that happened is they changed their foot position from a conventional X guard to a reverse X guard. Then there were some simple elevations and movement around the leg and suddenly you've taken someone who's spent years developing a certain skill and then adapted them within a matter of minutes to have two highly effective leg lock entries that they can use in training tomorrow. We're looking at the skill of entering into our training partner's legs from a bottom position.

(52:10 - 53:56)
We can't show the entire range of moves that we use, the range is simply too wide, but what we can do is give you a set of samples of ways in which we enter from bottom position in daily training and competition and from there you can see the broad principles that are in operation and adapt many of the other elements of sweeps, various forms of guard, etc., etc., and start to build from those your leg lock game. Let's start to look now at situations where my opponent is in half guard situations rather than butterfly seated or open guard situations. Anytime my opponent's in half guard things start to get interesting because I can't elevate them with two feet anymore, I've only got one leg to elevate them with.

On the face of it that might seem like a difficult assignment, it's okay to elevate someone with two feet, can I do it with one? Absolutely you can, it's actually in many ways my preferred way to elevate is with a single leg rather than both. When someone comes into your half guard it's true you only have one leg to elevate them with, but something else is in favour, their centre of gravity is much closer to yours, so you have to do a lot less work than you would in conventional situations. So yes you have half the lifting power but the task is twice as easy, so you can elevate just fine from half guard bottom.

Let's have a look at a situation where I think most people would describe the person on top as the advantage, but nonetheless I can still work directly into various forms of leg lock. Kam Saro has half guard position on top, not only does he have half guard position, he has what most people call a dominant half guard position. He has a full cross face, he has an underhook and he has good head position over me just like so.

(53:58 - 55:09)
I think if most people with any expertise in judicial walked into the room right now and they looked at the two of us in this position on the floor and they said who's got the better position? Everyone would agree the man on top does. In a situation like this it's easy for Kam Saro to flatten my head and shoulders to the mat and put extreme passing pressure on me. How am I going to enter into my opponent's legs in a situation like this? Well the first thing I do is I look at the leg which I'm controlling and I ask myself a simple question.

Is the knee on the floor or is it not? If the knee is on the mat as it is now, I will take my inside leg and I'll put my foot up here to my training partner's knee. I will put one foot on top of the other and place my two feet on the mat. Now we're going to perform a move which we call the knee lift.

It's often misunderstood as a bridge, this is not a bridge. I just take my hips an inch or two off the mat and all I do is I point my knees over to the wall in this direction. Because my opponent's arm is trapped this has an extreme off-balancing effect.

(55:10 - 56:10)
We can quickly start knocking people around the floor. Your opponents will want to base out with their arm to prevent being knocked over. If my opponent doesn't base out with his arm it's pretty easy for me to trap that arm, bring my hips off the mat and turn my opponent over and reverse the position.

So it's very much in my opponent's interest to take what is now his elbow and as I perform the knee lift to base out just like so. As I feel my training partner going to base out I'm going to take my hands inside my training partner's armpit just like so as a cross frame. Now I'm going to take both of my knees at the same time and as I frame my opponent's upper body I'm going to bring my knees up towards my chest so that my knee goes inside the pocket of my training partner's hip.

This means I now have angle on my training partner. My head is outside my opponent's leg. These are the perfect prerequisites to start entering into various forms of Ashi Garami.

(56:10 - 57:48)
I see that my opponent's head is moving out in this direction so what I'm going to do from here is immediately go in on the exposed heel, roll through and end up with the outside Ashi Garami finishing position. Once again my opponent's in a half guard situation. It's in here.

He has what most people would say is a dominant half guard top position. I'm going to take my inside leg and bring it up to the knee. That's very important.

Ultimately my knee has to fit into the pocket of my training partner's hip. The only way I can do that is bringing my foot up to the knee, foot over foot positioning. Now I bring my hips just a little bit off the floor and I point my knees out in this direction.

As a result my opponent has to base out. If he doesn't he'll fall. Now we clear the head we post on our training partner's upper body and we bring the knee into the pocket of our training partner's hip.

I look at my opponent's reaction to this. If the head is moving away from me he will always expose the heel and give us the outside heel position. If on the other hand my opponent's head moves in towards me we know what to do.

We gather up the leg, the hip, lift and drop our opponent down into a cross Ashi Garami situation. Once again from half guard bottom. My opponent has what most people would say is a dominant position.

(57:48 - 58:42)
If my opponent's naive and he keeps this strong grip it's the easiest thing in the world to off-balance so my opponent wisely bases out with his hands. Now we clear the head. I bring my knee inside the pocket of my training partner's hip.

When he tries to recover the position it's an easy thing for me to go into reverse X guard, lift and assist and put the hand down. We're looking at the idea of entering into our training partner's legs from a half guard situation. We've just seen an opponent can take what most people would believe is a very dominating position under hook and cross face and even so you can still enter into your opponent's legs.

(58:43 - 59:23)
We looked at the idea of a knee level which is highly effective when my opponent's knee is down on the floor. Now an obvious question here is what if my opponent's knee is not on the floor? Many times your opponent will take knees off the mat to drive more weight into a cross face and put additional pressure. So from here Kama Saro's inside knee starts coming off the mat so we can start putting pressure on him.

What we're going to do in this situation is we're going to scissor our legs around the training partner's knee. I can't be naive here and say my leg's loose and he starts bringing his knee free. There has to be some pressure on my opponent's leg but I can't hit my leg's triangle.

(59:23 - 59:29)
Now I can't move. I'm holding him but I've also held myself in place. That's not the idea.

(59:29 - 59:54)
The idea is to hold him while you can move around. So from this position I'm going to have my legs scissored around my training partner's leg so my two knees point in more or less the same direction. When Kama Saro goes to kick his leg out it's difficult.

There's a good bite on the leg. Without my legs I keep being locked. Now I'm going to take my inside foot and I'm going to put it on Kama Saro's lower calf muscle right here and I'm going to contour my foot with his calf muscle.

(59:55 - 1:01:38)
So when he goes to kick out my foot acts as a blocker on the back side of his leg. My thigh functions as a blocker on the front of his leg so that I have wedges on both sides of my opponent's legs. This creates freedom of movement in my right leg which means I can effortlessly pommel my right foot through and around and get a hook underneath my training partner's hamstring muscle just like so.

Now normally in half guard we're always trying to scoot our hips out. Here I do the exact opposite. I scoot my hips in underneath my opponent so that my centre of gravity goes underneath his.

Usually I have an initial hold just like so. A back heel on the back of his calf and a butterfly hook like this. So when he goes to kick out it's quite difficult.

Both sides of the legs are wedged in place. However when it's time to move I can plop my foot in the middle and scoot my centre of gravity under his. Now we're in the perfect position to double thumb force on my training partner's armpit just like so and clear the head.

I bring my knee to the dominant inside position. From here I take a scoot grip on the knee that is off the floor. From that scoot grip I transition directly into reverse x guard and as a result we get a quick lift and a drop down to the leaning position.

Once again from an initial half guard situation where my opponent's knee has come off the mat so we can drive pressure into my face. Initially I take my knees and scissor around my training partner's leg so when he goes to free his leg there's a deep bite on the leg. It's hard for him to move.

(1:01:39 - 1:05:21)
Now I put the foot on the back of his Achilles tendon to catch it in place. That makes it easy for me to have a mobile lower right leg which can easily pommel and hook. Then I bite in and hold the leg so when he goes to pommel out it's difficult.

When the time is right I plant the foot shoot my hips so my centre of gravity goes under his post and clear. My knee comes into the pocket of my training partner's head. It's an easy thing for me now.

I take a scoot grip on my training partner's leg. I take my second foot and pommel through into the classic reverse x guard situation. We know the three keys to elevation.

We have to get our opponent's hips directly over our head. We have to get an angle and we have to get our knee inside the pocket of our training partner's head. First hips over head.

Now angle and now we kick through with a hand assist which places my knee directly inside the pocket of his head. When I lock the triangle he goes down to the floor and we're in a winning position. One of the themes that we're pushing in this dvd series is the idea that many of you as athletes in this world already have well-developed skills and those skills pushed in the right directions can easily be adapted into the leg locking game so that you can take shortcuts to leg locking excellence using methods and techniques and skills tactics that you've already been working on for many years.

A good example of this occurs in a very popular position in the sport of jiu-jitsu deep half guard. I'm going to show first how we go through some of that. Deep half guard is a position that he excels in and I'm very confident that within a very short period of time he'll be able to go through and work the moves that I'm about to show.

Let's start off with a basic entry into deep half guard and let's understand what are some of the advantages of working from a deep half guard situation. We just looked in the previous move at the idea of working in situations where my opponent had chest-to-chest contact and we use a single leg elevator to put our opponent up and get him to the leg lock game. One of the great advantages of deep half guard is that the very nature of this position prevents my opponent from getting chest-to-chest contact.

It's hard for him to put weight on top of me. In addition it takes one of my opponent's legs and takes the knee off the mat. We already know from earlier in the day that taking knees off the mat makes the task of entering to the legs a lot easier.

From a situation where I have my opponent in half guard and I have an arm around my training partner's waist and my arm is underneath his, we can go through and contact at our training partner's far hip. Now I'm going to go elbow deep inside my training partner's leg just like so. From here with my body angled across my opponent's knee line it's relatively simple for me to use the momentum of my legs to swing around the corner and put my opponent into a situation where now he cannot put his chest on top of my chest because I'm facing the same direction that he's facing.

In addition this knee has come off the mat. I have a good bite on my training partner's near leg and I have an ability to pommel with both feet around his far leg. This is going to make it very easy for me to pommel one foot underneath my training partner's calf muscle.

(1:05:21 - 1:08:27)
I can use that foot to lift and elevate and feed my own leg in as a hook. It's extremely easy for me to lift this leg because most of my opponent's weight is tied up on his hand. From a situation like this I take my free hand and I form it into a cross frame on my training partner's legs.

Now I go into a reverse X guard position with my feet. I effortlessly slide my feet up to my training partner's hips and as a result my hips come up to the floor. I double catch my training partner's leg, punch through and we find ourselves in a weighing position down on the mat.

Let's have a look at this again. From a situation where I start off around my training partner's waist, I go through elbow deep on my training partner's leg. Now we turn the corner and go with a deep half guard.

From here I start the process of elevating and feeding one leg to the other. At this stage we're in something close to a conventional X guard. However, by putting a cross frame in place and switching into reverse X guard, it's an easy thing to elevate my opponent's hips over my head.

We've got a fine angle on our training partner now and we're in the perfect position to hand assist on both legs, lock the triangle so my knee is inside his hip and put him down into a winning position. Now the warrior starts an arm around the waist and finds himself down a deep half guard. From deep half guard it's an easy thing for him to start the process of lifting and elevating his opponent and feed the leg through.

Now he's going to switch to his cross arm frame and bring his opponent's hips over his head, kick through and lock the triangle and effortlessly push across the line in the hips and pull his opponent down into a winning position. You can see that on one take Bernardo Faria took a skill that he's already expert at and with a simple modification in foot position has gone into one of the best leg locking positions in the entire sport. Let's have a look at that again.

Starting from the basic half guard situation where Bernardo has a tight waist grip underneath his opponent's arm and a scoop grip with his other arm, it's very easy for Bernardo to swing and turn 180 degrees and stopping right there. You can see the advantage of half guard situation, sorry deep half guard situation. It's impossible for Carmichael to get chest to chest contact and pin his opponent's shoulders and hips to the mat because essentially they're facing in the same direction.

In addition this frees up both of Bernardo Faria's legs so he can easily start pommeling his legs to inside positions. From here he makes a quick switch to a reverse X guard, elevates his opponent and kicks easily into a winning position. Then a final push along the line of the hips, perpendicular to the hip as always, ends with him in the best finishing position in the sport.


## Volume 8

(0:04 - 0:24)
We're looking at the idea of entering into the leg game from half guard scenarios. In particular, we're looking now at deep half guard. From a situation where I have a tight waist grip around my training partner and a scoot grip inside the leg, we've seen that we can turn 180 degrees and turn underneath our training partner and go into a deep half guard situation.

(0:25 - 0:41)
In the previous move, I kept my arm on the near leg and we used elevation to enter the legs. This time a different route. We're going to take our arm from the near leg and we're going to go across to the far leg, just like so.

(0:41 - 0:57)
Now, from the situation, I'm going to take my foot and put it underneath my training partner's leg, like so. I'm going to elevate my training partner's leg, not up, but out and over. So his leg comes out in this direction.

(0:58 - 1:14)
As a result, it's a pretty easy thing to use the momentum of my legs to whip and come up behind my training partner. Conventionally here, we move towards our training partner's back. Your opponents know that, so very often they move their back away in this direction.

(1:15 - 1:21)
So you start to lose the back. You're trying to increase the distance between your chest and their back. If they didn't, I'd go straight to their back.

(1:22 - 1:27)
So what do they all do? They move their back away. I catch the leg. The back move, the leg didn't.

(1:27 - 1:50)
Now, all I do is drop to an elbow, and I pass my foot through, around, and roll. And as a result, we end up in a perfect position with a syntago around our training partner's leg, ready to punch. Once again, from a half guard situation, I have a tight waist grip and a scoop grip.

(1:52 - 2:01)
We go into deep half guard. From here, we start an action of lifting. We put our foot around our training partner's leg.

(2:01 - 2:18)
We make sure that we transfer the arm from near to far leg. From here, I use my foot at the ankle to move my opponent's leg over. I come up by scissoring my legs, and then put my knee as a wedge behind his ankle.

(2:19 - 2:30)
My elbow goes as a wedge in front of my training partner's calf muscle. So I have wedges on both sides of my opponent's lower leg. I put a third wedge over the hip.

(2:31 - 2:52)
Then all I do is come down to an elbow, like so. Because the lower leg is wedged, when Kamosara goes to yank his leg out, it's stuck. Now, all I do is throw my leg through and around, so that when we roll, we end up in the perfect position to go into the legs and the finish.

(2:52 - 3:11)
One more time. From a conventional deep half guard situation, I pass my arm from near leg to far leg. I switch feet, lift, and elevate.

(3:12 - 3:27)
I scissor my legs, put a wedge behind the ankle, and a wedge over the shin. So when he goes to yank his leg out, it's shockingly difficult. I pass my foot through and around.

(3:27 - 4:01)
When I roll, we end up in the perfect position to finish. Now, Bernardo transfers his arm across to the second leg. Now, he pulls his left foot underneath the Achilles tendon, coming all the way down, and lifts out in this direction.

(4:01 - 4:15)
As a result, he can quickly scissor up and put his knee right behind as a wedge. This one here comes all the way down and holds. This hip here comes over the top and holds as a top wedge.

(4:15 - 4:28)
Let's do an experiment. Wedging with tricep, quadricep, and wrist, Kamosara is going to try and yank his leg out. And you can see, Bernardo's function is like an anchor, hanging onto his opponent's leg.

(4:29 - 4:57)
Now, he's going to put his elbow and shoulder down towards the mat, and throw his left foot over the top. He's going to put his foot inside the far leg, and then he's going to do a forward roll, and come out the other side with a triangle, and a perfect entry into a fine inside heel hook. Once again, this was done on first take, with an athlete who's extremely experienced in one aspect of the half guard game.

(4:58 - 5:26)
With just a few minutes of coaching, in fact, not even a single repetition, that was the first repetition, he was able to perform the move flawlessly, just by watching it done in front of him. Let me do it one more time. It's hard to do it, because the modifications involved are so small, from his already highly developed game, it's so easy for him to take on new skills, and tag them onto his existing skills, in a way which I'm confident many of you will be able to do.

(5:27 - 5:32)
Yeah guys, my first time doing it. I had never done this move before. So, now second.

(5:32 - 5:41)
Let's see. So, right here, here, here. Good.

(5:41 - 5:49)
Left foot, facing forward. Spin, pop up. Winging, left arm over.

(5:50 - 5:58)
Good. And now, hooking the left leg over, and your shoe laces hook into this thigh. Beautiful.

(5:58 - 7:10)
Now, rolling through, locking the triangle, and a perfect finishing position, all done in one hour. Yeah, it's very cool that it's something that's related with my game, that's the deep half guard, but, and I have seen you hooks before, but not on this way, and not from this angle, in this situation, that there is even one position that I like to do here from the deep half guard, that I call the Turkish get up, that I go here, and I sweep the guy from here, what happens, what kind of, exactly what John said, or I go for the sweep, or I go for the person's back, but it's very cool, because of this situation here, relates with the Turkish get up, but instead of going to the person's back, I go for the heel hook from here, and this is the toughest one, right John? This is the one that hurts the most, right? Let's bring this back to one of the classic elements of this high-level system, the idea of dilemma. Bernardo's gonna go through exactly the same sequence, about how to go for the Turkish get up situation.

(7:11 - 7:22)
Let's look at how Bernardo can play the threat of the back and the legs together. Remember, great players always work in terms of dilemmas. Good players create problems for their opponents.

(7:22 - 7:42)
Great players create dilemmas. When Bernardo comes out the back door, as his head comes out, as the head comes out, a dilemma starts to unfold. If Karmasara doesn't move his upper body away from Bernardo, he'll take the back every single time, and now we're going through the back attack system.

(7:43 - 7:55)
However, if Karmasara moves the upper body away, the lower body stays. So you play your opponent through the threat of back exposure and leg exposure. You can only hide one, you can't hide both.

(7:55 - 8:04)
It's either the back's moving or the leg's moving. One of them, take your choice. Now, because there's little back exposure, it's too far away, Bernardo settles for the legs.

(8:04 - 8:27)
Hooks in. Steps over, finds the thigh hamstring, rolls through, and as Karmasara denied him the back, he offered him the leg. When you start to see the sport in this fashion, as constructing dilemmas, where you always have a bad outcome for your opponent, that's when the submission game truly starts to open up.

(8:28 - 8:42)
Very good. Can I do one more time on this leg that we just did? So now instead of going for the, instead of using the hooks, I'm going to go for the leg. I'm going to use it to do, I'm going to go to the back, and I'm going to end up here.

(8:43 - 8:53)
Switch over, as I go. Beautiful. Look, I look at that three repetitions and you're doing it better than me.

(8:54 - 9:06)
Very good. Yeah, guys, it's this one position that I used to do a lot in Turkish Ghetto. And now in less than like two minutes here, I could apply the John's system from one position that I used to do for a very long time.

(9:07 - 9:17)
I'm going to pause and go for it. Love it. We're looking at the idea of entering into our training partner's legs from the bottom position.

(9:18 - 9:37)
We're looking at a bunch of scenarios where you can do so. So far, almost all of the methods of entering into our training partner's legs have involved the idea of elevation, of getting underneath our training partner's centre gravity, elevating so their knees come up off the mat, and then from there, entering into the legs. That's not the only method of entering the legs from the bottom position.

(9:38 - 10:03)
Another family of entering into the legs from the bottom position occurs are the so-called inversions, where I invert my body so my weight goes up into the points of my shoulders and I can fire my legs up into winning positions. Let's have a look at how this might start to emerge out of reverse De La Riva guards. I'm in a situation where Kama Sara is on top position and I have a reverse De La Riva hook on my training partner.

(10:03 - 10:34)
My shoelaces are merging here on my training partner's quarter set, my leg going through, controlling the knee from the inside position. Kama Sara has a split squat position with his knee down low, his other leg out wide, and presumably he'll have hands on me like so, okay? From here, we can go in on the attack by taking our hand around our training partner's ankle and then putting the back of our wrist through on our training partner. Initially, my two feet will be close together.

(10:35 - 10:52)
I use my two feet to load my opponent's weight onto the second leg. Most of the time, his hips will be low, low, and driving into me in order to start some kind of guard position sequence. So we use our two legs to straighten his body out and put his weight on the far leg.

(10:52 - 11:11)
So my hand goes inside and is an initial movement of my two legs that moves him away from me. I now start going deep around my training partner's lead ankle. My free hand goes across my training partner's body and from here, we go on into this position, my two feet close together, wedging around my training partner's hips.

(11:12 - 11:36)
We're in a good position now to start driving his body weight forward. And now we can start going on the attack on our training partner's legs. The first attack we're gonna look at involves switching from the leg that I'm currently controlling, pushing his body weight forward and switching around the corner, dropping my knee inside, and then from here, dropping the inside Senkaku and dropping our training partner straight down into a winning position.

(11:37 - 11:59)
Once again, I'll reverse the Alejandro situation, like so. As my opponent goes into a strong passing position and drops his hips, the first thing we're gonna do is put the back of our wrists in front of our training partner's ankle and shoelaces. I use the extension of my legs to put my opponent's weight onto the far leg, like so.

(12:00 - 12:17)
Now from here, I start an action of turning and inverting, keeping my feet close together. My two legs push his body weight forward and as a result, it's an easy thing for me to switch to the opposite leg. I bring my foot around the corner so my knee is inside his hip.

(12:18 - 12:36)
My second leg goes through, off the elevation, drop our opponent down into a winning position. I'll demonstrate it from another angle so you can see the hooking action of my hand. My reverse De La Riva, like so.

(12:37 - 12:49)
My hand initially was on the ankle. I feed the back of my wrist through and extend my two legs. As a result, we can start that initial inversion underneath our training partner's body.

(12:50 - 13:03)
I bring my training partner's body weight forward by extending the legs. As I catch my training partner's leg, I switch and lock a triangle. As a result, I can drop my opponent straight down to the mat.

(13:12 - 13:36)
Let's look at how we can use that same reverse De La Riva inversion to go into the near leg. From that same situation, my opponent's in a split squat, looking to pass against my reverse De La Riva. From here, we've seen the idea of taking our hand initially on our opponent's Achilles tendon, feeding through, extending, so we can come around into this good attacking position.

(13:37 - 14:02)
Okay? Now, this time, instead of attacking the far leg, we're gonna post the far leg and switch our legs underneath our training partner so we can turn, lock, and attack our training partner's near leg. And as a result, we end up in a winning position. Once again, on the reverse De La Riva entry, I go through, locking, and extending.

(14:03 - 14:21)
Off that initial inversion, I come up and my feet switch. My foot follows through and around. And as a result, it's an easy thing to turn my body's angle, rock with a full synchronicity locked around my legs, and into a winning position.

(14:28 - 14:35)
We're looking at the idea of looking from the reverse De La Riva guard. So far, our opponent's in a position we call the split squat. We had a leg out wide.

(14:37 - 14:45)
We had a reverse De La Riva, and he was out there with the leg out wide. It's a fairly conventional passing position. Sometimes you'll get an opponent who puts his knee down to the floor.

(14:45 - 14:57)
Not a bad idea on his part, especially if he's worried about the leg locking game. In situations like this, we'll start off putting the hands through. We're gonna extend and get his knee basing out like so, knee on the floor.

(14:57 - 15:19)
Now, from the situation, just like before, we'll go around the corner into this good attacking position. Whenever I see my opponent in this position, it's not a difficult thing for me to over-rotate around the corner and start coming into position underneath my opponent right here. And what have we got? Right into a reverse head start.

(15:20 - 15:42)
Not a difficult thing now to catch the knee, lift our opponent up off the mat, and drop him into our favourite attacking position. Once again, in the situation, reverse De La Riva guard, my opponent's dropped the knee to the floor. We'll catch on our training partner, I'm standing my training partner's body guard in the way.

(15:42 - 16:03)
As a result, we can start the action of rotating. Look at how I over-rotate, going all the way through on my training partner. Now, we're in the perfect position, reverse head start to start bringing his hips over our head and drop him into our favourite control position to set up a strong table, very easy.

(16:03 - 16:25)
Let's go. One of our favourite ways of entering into the legs using the process of inversion occurs out of knee shield half guards. The knee shield is an incredibly useful means of preventing my opponent from putting heavy chest pressure on me whenever I would from a half guard situation.

(16:28 - 16:43)
Typically, when someone's in a half guard on top, they're looking to get chest to chest contact and flatten and pin my head and shoulders to the mat. Knee shield is designed to stop that from happening. There's a variety of places I can use my shield, anywhere from the shoulders to the hip.

(16:44 - 17:03)
But when we work without a gi, as a general rule, I prefer to keep my knee close to my opponent's hip. This is especially true when I'm dealing with my own students who are highly proficient in leg locking. So I'm gonna keep my feet either locked or at the very least close together and my knee in the pocket of my training partner's near hip.

(17:04 - 17:11)
Don't make this common mistake. Don't bring the knee across to the far hip. Now you're setting yourself up to easily be squashed and passed.

(17:13 - 17:39)
So we keep a very shallow knee shield right here on the near hip like so. This is used in conjunction with a cross frame where I put my hand on my opponent's shoulder and my forearm and elbow on the near shoulder so that as Kyle Massara goes forward to drive body weight into me, it's a difficult thing for him to accomplish. Now, I'm gonna use my legs in a way quite similar that a beginner will use a scissor sweep.

(17:40 - 18:04)
You guys are all familiar with Jiu-Jitsu 101 with the idea of a scissor sweep, where my legs go around my training partner and I scissor and drop my training partner to the mat. From a knee shield situation, I'm gonna take that same scissoring action and apply it on one leg. This provides a small off-balancing effect that gets my opponent's body weight moving away from me.

(18:04 - 18:11)
I don't want his body weight crowding me either. That's never a good thing. I'm gonna use that half scissor and get him moving away.

(18:11 - 18:23)
I'm gonna take my free arm and lock it here inside my training partner's leg. Now, this is where things get interesting. I'm gonna take my knee from the near hip to the far hip.

(18:23 - 18:45)
I do it behind the safety of my friend. As my knee comes across my training partner's body, I push into my training partner's hip, I plant my foot on the mat, and now I go around the corner and I pull my hip inside my training partner's leg. So my hip goes inside the knee.

(18:46 - 18:57)
This is a very, very important detail. You'll notice that my whole body is stacked up on my shoulders. From this position, I can use my legs like a pendulum.

(18:58 - 19:22)
That pendulum effect enables me to dominate the inside of my opponent's hip with my right foot. The pendulum supplies the horsepower, but it's my right foot that provides the connection. Because my hips and lower back are off the ground, I have a great ability to bring my opponent out of balance and into a very strong attacking position.

(19:23 - 19:40)
Once again, from a knee shield situation, I have a shallow knee shield in the pocket of my training partner's near hip. I have a cross frame on my training partner. I use a half scissor action to move his head out of my way.

(19:41 - 19:58)
I get a scoop grip on my training partner. I use that to put my hand under the armpit, come up and put my knee into my training partner's hip. As a result, I can create sufficient space to pull my head inside my training partner's legs.

(19:58 - 20:24)
This puts his hips over my head, the essential prerequisite of movement in this position. Now from here, I use a pendulum action of my leg combined with the hooking action of this leg to move my opponent across the line of his hips, the one direction where he has no base. And as a result, I can easily put him down to the floor and go into a very strong attacking position.

(20:25 - 20:44)
Let's have a look at some common mistakes that can definitely cause problems when you attempt this move. Probably the single most common mistake I see is people are too quick to bring their knee across. If they're shielding here, they bring their knee across.

(20:44 - 20:58)
Their opponent simply scrolls and it's a disaster. Initially, focus here on this hip. In a worst case scenario where he moves the knee off the hip, there's still good things you can do to recover.

(20:59 - 21:14)
Now, once I go in and hook on my training partner, my hand goes from above the shoulder to under the shoulder. That's very important because my head has to move towards him. I don't want to run right into my opponent's cross face and then I can't move.

(21:15 - 21:27)
So I need to go under to prevent that from happening. Now, with my hand in place, the knee follows. Once the knee follows, now we get into the next most common problem.

(21:28 - 21:40)
People try to do the move without putting their head inside. Their opponent simply walks away from them and nothing happens. I have to get my head inside the space between his knees.

(21:40 - 21:57)
That's absolutely critical. So once I push across my training partner from here, look how I slingshot my head inside. Look how I stay on my shoulders.

(21:57 - 22:09)
A common mistake is people over-rotate and they go off their shoulders onto their hips. That's a potential disaster. When I over-rotate, all this weight ends up on top of me.

(22:10 - 22:24)
Yes, I have an inside Senkaku. Yes, it is possible for me to finish from this position, but it's awfully, awfully difficult because I'm contending against my opponent's body weight and the strength of his score. I'm not going to say you can't finish from here.

(22:24 - 22:43)
You can, especially if I can get a hold of my opponent's lower leg and start elevating him. But it's not easy at world championship level. In general, you're better off working from the points of your shoulders where you can use the pendulum action to throw this body weight decisively and easily and end up in that preferred position.

(22:44 - 23:08)
So avoiding those mistakes, let's look now at a proper application of the move. It all starts with the classic no-gi version of the knee shield, dominating the near side hip, then forming an effective frame that starts above the shoulder, then a scissoring action that moves my training partner's head away from me. Then a switch of hand from above to below.

(23:08 - 23:45)
That sets up the elbow deep grip, the movement of my knee across, and then the critical pulling of my hip inside his knee. Now, even when Kawasara goes to move away from me, from here, the lifting action of my right leg combined with the pendulum action of my left puts him down into a winning position. One of the themes that we're working with in this DVD series is the idea of taking athletes who already have a strongly developed skill set and adding leg lock skills onto what they already have.

(23:45 - 24:06)
A sad perception of leg locks is that they run contrary to the spirit of Jiu-Jitsu, when in fact, I think they work extraordinarily well with already strongly established skills that many of the current athletes already have. And Adhatharaya has always been very, very well known for his knee shield half guard. It's always been one of the strongest aspects of his game.

(24:06 - 24:40)
We've seen already that knee shield provides an excellent opportunity to go into full inversions on the point of our shoulders and throw our opponents to some of the strongest of all leg locking positions. Let's look at how easily Adhatharaya picks up the skill from a scenario that he's obviously extremely familiar with and very much an expert in, and then adds on a few simple elements of the leg locking game and ends up in one of the strongest leg locking positions in the sport. From a knee shield half guard situation, Adhatharaya does a good job of covering the knee a bit.

(24:41 - 25:03)
Then from here, starting with a frame above his opponent's shoulder, he starts off balancing his opponent with that scissor action. That gets the head moving away from us and sets up an ability to put our hand underneath the armpit and then scoop inside the leg. This is gonna enable us to push that shield from one hip across to the other and fully invert up onto the points of our shoulders.

(25:04 - 25:24)
Once we get there, the whole thing is to get our head inside our opponent. So as the head comes inside, we are now going to use a full pendulum action to whip our opponent over and into a full inside Senkaku position, cross Ashi Garani. As a result, we go into knee bar finishes or inside Hiro's and leave that up to you.

(25:26 - 25:41)
That was a perfect repetition. Done on the first flush, by an athlete who's already extremely well-defined in his initial game and within a matter of minutes, merely by looking at the action, he was able to successfully complete the movements. One more time.

(25:43 - 26:04)
So, here, perfect. Beautiful. Now your choice, knee bar or inside Hiro.

(26:05 - 26:10)
Excellent. Very good. You're a fucking wimp, I'll substitute you.

(26:10 - 26:31)
You're good. Now, we've been looking at practical scenarios where we can use much of the theoretical knowledge we learned earlier in the DVDs and in scenarios that you find yourself in every single day of your training. We've broken these four scenarios into four main categories.

(26:31 - 26:48)
Standing position, ground position on the bottom, ground position on top, and double seated position. Let's begin now our study of top position on the ground. Entering into our training partner's legs and getting into Ashi Garani from top position.

(26:49 - 27:11)
The first thing I assess by working to get into my partner's legs is I ask myself a simple question. Is my opponent in a seated position or is he in a supine position? It's always the fundamental dichotomy because how I go into entering in the legs is very different depending upon what I see in front of me. Let's look at a situation where Kamosawa is placed down here and he's in a seated position.

(27:12 - 27:27)
From here, I essentially want to dominate the inside space on my training partner here. Let's define the inside space as clearly as possible. The inside space is essentially the metre step on the combination of my opponent's centre line and his knee line.

(27:28 - 27:37)
There's his knee line. I need to step onto that line somewhere close to the centre line. If I can get there, then I'm dominating the inside space.

(27:38 - 27:44)
That's always my goal. Unfortunately, he knows that's my goal. And so he will do everything he can do to close up that space.

(27:45 - 27:58)
Typically, I'm gonna have to fight through hands and feet to get to that space. Now, when I go to open up my opponent in this situation, there's a bunch of ways I can do it. I can do it by attempting to push and move my opponent.

(27:58 - 28:06)
That's a fairly simple strategy. I'll stand in front of my opponent like so and start thumb-posting. His hands are currently in front of me and they can cause problems.

(28:06 - 28:16)
But I can do simple snap-downs, et cetera, et cetera. Step my hands down to the mat, now he's gonna start to react to that. As I move to an angle on my opponent, he can't keep his feet in that position.

(28:17 - 28:32)
I move to an angle, he's gonna start facing me. As he goes to turn and face me in a seated guard position, that's gonna open up situations for me to step in. What I generally recommend is, don't try to go in through the front door when you're trying to steal inside space.

(28:32 - 28:45)
It's too easy for your opponent to use hands and feet to block you. You've got to generate some kind of movement to open your opponent's feet and expose the area between your knees for you to step in through. Let's look at some simple strategies to do this.

(28:46 - 28:59)
We'll look already at one. The inside space is currently completely closed off by the feet, and it's protected by the hands. So I'm gonna stand at a distance with my training partner and go down into a stance where my head level is roughly the same as his.

(29:00 - 29:08)
I will go in and put a thumb post on my training partner. The thumb post enables me to start a pushing jab. He's gonna start pushing back against that.

(29:08 - 29:17)
Then from here, my second hand comes out. I step to an angle and I hit a snap to put his two hands down on the floor. Off that movement, I move to an angle.

(29:17 - 29:25)
If he doesn't react to my movement, I'll go around behind my opponent. So he has to react to the movement. He has to turn and face me, otherwise I'll take his back.

(29:27 - 29:38)
Once I start with my hands on the floor, I move him out to an angle. He has to turn and face, and that's exactly where the inside space starts to open up. Now from here, I put my hand on the floor and I backstep.

(29:39 - 29:54)
And off that backstep, I dominate the inside of the knee, block, arms up, one of our favourite attacking positions. Once again, I have to use tactics to steal inside space. You're not just gonna walk in the front door and take it.

(29:55 - 30:13)
Initially, it's my thumb post. It starts a push-pull dynamic, okay? Off the initial pull, I start, sorry, off the initial push, I start going into a pull, hitting a simple snap. I put my hand behind my training partner's tricep, my other hand in here, and snap the hands down to the floor.

(30:13 - 30:23)
Now I step to an angle. My partner goes to react to the step, opens up space to make a step into. I put the head down low, block, and find myself in a winning position.

(30:27 - 30:44)
And I don't wanna hear that much, all right? Kill him or run from here? Cool. Okay, first, let's quickly review the tactics that we use. Okay? You can clearly see, face the camera, Karl, sorry, that Karl's feet are completely covering the inside position.

(30:44 - 30:56)
Not only are the feet covering the inside position, his hands are covering his feet. So there's two lines of defence here. He's got his head well forward, I can't just flip this, there's obstructions in the way, I've got to remove those obstructions.

(30:57 - 31:25)
So, first, I play a distance game where I move in on my training partner like so, okay? From here, I use a thumb post to start a push-pull dynamic, okay? If my opponent starts interfering with my thumb post, I'll take the hand off, okay? Until eventually we get through. Now, I step to an angle, I hit a quick snap, puts my opponent's hands down to the floor, okay? I start moving to an angle that he has to address. Off that movement, space starts to develop.

(31:26 - 31:39)
I step and I put my head to the shoulder. If my head is too high, I backstep to the side and always hit a corner. I put my head to the shoulder and I scoot either outside or inside the leg.

(31:40 - 32:03)
Now, as I go around the corner, the knee comes in as a wedge and we raise the ankle. End up in perfect attacking position. Circle, the other hand's up, step back.

(32:04 - 32:12)
Now, left hand grabs the ankle. Good, backstep and slide your knee under the other knee. Lock a triangle with your legs as you fall over.

(32:13 - 32:18)
And look at that. You've got the perfect attacking position. What's up? Well done tonight.

(32:20 - 32:29)
What's up? What's up? Well done. Well done. You see how you're using tactics successfully to open the inside position? Yes.

(32:29 - 32:40)
So, here, locking, then I go to the other side. And then I go to the other corner. Beautiful.

(32:42 - 32:50)
And here, and then I go to the other corner. That's awesome. Beautiful.

(32:51 - 33:07)
That's good. Now, let's look at some more tactics to open up inside position on my training partner. Again, we have an experienced opponent who's protecting the inside position with his feet, and he's protecting his feet with his hands and his thumbs.

(33:08 - 33:32)
Whenever I work with an opponent like this, I have to develop some kind of set of tactics to open up the space between his knees so I can steal the inside space and go into the leg A. Previously, we looked at the idea of snap downs. A very different tactic in these situations is for us to start with a thumb post and then go into a lateral step. We're going to use a combination of footwork to give advantage on our training partner.

(33:33 - 33:51)
I'm going to step laterally, like so. Then I'm going to take a cross step with my right foot. And a cross step, my head moves like so, and I take my right foot and I swing in an arc all the way around my training partner's knee line and sit up to my training partner's hip.

(33:52 - 34:07)
My opponent has to address this. Could be safe for years, it's the easiest thing in the world for me to go behind my opponent, okay? No one will accept you stepping in that cross step fashion without a fight. Any Jiu-Jitsu player worth his salt will never allow his back to be exposed in that way.

(34:10 - 34:30)
So I hit my cross step. This is going to force my opponent to face, create distance, and create an opening which I can step into, okay? So I create a simple dilemma where my opponent, if he doesn't react to what I do, I take his back. If he does, he's going to open up space for me to work with.

(34:31 - 34:42)
From in front of my training partner, I post and step. There's the big cross step that creates the initial movement. Colin has to post, hands, and slide.

(34:42 - 34:55)
And look at that, we've opened up space. Now a key element, I step past the knee line and I put my forehead in my training partner's shoulder. That's the penetration step that gives us the secondary leg.

(34:55 - 35:17)
There's the footwork that gives us the primary leg. And there's the form that gives us the perfect entry into the legs. Beautiful.

(35:25 - 35:50)
Excellent. Once again, we've got a situation where we have an experienced athlete using simple tactics which he uses every day in the gym to set up an aspect of his game that normally he doesn't use. Enjoy.

(35:51 - 36:05)
To finish the view from this situation, what's the proper way to move here? The first thing we need to do is have our opponent's knee facing more up to the ceiling. So we're going to shift our body, good. Now this knee here always wants to point at our training partner's belly button.

(36:06 - 36:20)
We're going to shift the orientation of our body by taking our hips out in this direction, good. So that our knee stays towards our training partner's stomach. Now, you're going to take your elbow, you're going to cover, your opponent's foot in the appropriate fashion, and then lock up.

(36:20 - 36:26)
You're going to fall towards me, towards me, and the hips go forward, like that. Very good. Good.

(36:26 - 36:32)
So, I got to force his knee to be up. Let's have a look at this. My bad.

(36:35 - 37:01)
In any situation where I have my feet to the inside, I can break directly from the foot to foot position, or I can transfer to a Senkaku. I can also take a Senkaku, put my foot nice on the opposite side. These are all good options, okay? From here, the most important thing, I need to get my two knees directly facing my partner's chest, okay? The more my knees point out in this direction, that's the rotation of his escape.

(37:02 - 37:14)
Good, okay? Always remember that the fundamental problem in this position is the turnout problem. I know what I need to do. I need to keep his heel under control and keep his kneecap facing towards me to the greatest degree possible.

(37:15 - 37:32)
He knows he needs to turn out in this direction. As he turns out, it's harder and harder for me to access the heel, okay? So, in these situations, our favourite way of stopping a turnout problem is to catch the secondary leg. Somebody tries to turn out, his own leg will stop him.

(37:32 - 37:37)
Good. This creates the release problem. When I release the leg, he turns out again.

(37:37 - 37:51)
Good. And we're in trouble, okay? So what we want to do is always keep his knee facing us. We often put a hand assist in here, like so, and I artificially point my knee at his sternum.

(37:51 - 38:02)
If my knee goes across in this direction, I'm assisting him in escaping with his knee. Good, okay? So I point my knee at him, and it functions as a brake in his hip. When he goes to turn, it makes it difficult.

(38:03 - 38:09)
I extend my foot into the far hamstring. He goes to turn, it's not easy. Good.

(38:09 - 38:19)
Now, the control, block, and from here, when it's time to finish, I like to go down to my shoulder. Good. I bring my hips over his hips, and it's done.

(38:20 - 38:24)
Look at me. You don't go straight. I'm going to do the tackle here, so I start from here.

(38:25 - 38:34)
So I'm going to go there, I'm going to stay low, I'm going to step back, I'm going to bring my knee. Good. Then I'm going to fall, and then to make sure he doesn't roll, I control his leg.

(38:34 - 38:44)
Good. Right? So then, when I go there to attack, in danger now, he's going to come this way. So I like to quickly hold the knee with your right hand.

(38:45 - 38:48)
Good. And pull back. Left elbow goes over his ankle.

(38:49 - 38:54)
Good. Block. Now, from here, take your right foot and put it under this hamstring.

(38:55 - 38:59)
Right foot. Good. And now, have your feet very close together.

(38:59 - 39:04)
Good. Now, go down to your shoulders, your hands locked. Down to your shoulder.

(39:05 - 39:09)
And now, drive your pelvis up towards the cameras. I got it. There we go.

(39:09 - 39:19)
That's strong. So, I always try to figure out what's the most important thing. Can you say that this is one of the most important things? Because this is where he's going to escape, he's going to come.

(39:20 - 39:26)
It's, um... There's only one word. The short answer is no, it's more important than that. I get it.

(39:26 - 39:37)
It's a useful experience to stop the guy moving, but it's not going to be enough at the highest level. It's a detail, but it's not the absolute critical detail. I got it.

(39:37 - 39:52)
So, why do we call it the absolute critical detail here? Okay. Everything I do in this position is designed to prevent my opponent from turning out in that direction. So, the number one thing, if I can, is to seize this leg.

(39:52 - 39:58)
I got it. Okay? But at some point, I have to release this leg. And that's when the whole turnout problem reemerges.

(39:58 - 40:10)
You had the release problem, and now it's moving in this direction. So, my number one thing, when it's time to chase a leg in this direction, is to keep my head inside his knee. His whole thing is to turn his knee this way.

(40:11 - 40:16)
Okay. Right now, there's nowhere to heal. With the knee turned, I simply can't get to his heel.

(40:17 - 40:29)
Okay? So, my whole thing is to bring my head inside his knee. Now, as Carl continues to turn, my head becomes a post on the floor. I got it.

(40:29 - 40:41)
So that when he continues to turn, my head stops him from moving. When he stops moving, that's when I can catch up to the heel and lock it. Again, roll through.

(40:43 - 40:48)
And then start. And then it's done. Okay? See, the number one thing is always hip position.

(40:49 - 40:58)
So, here. Boom. Yeah, to prevent him to roll, I'm gonna control his leg.

(40:58 - 41:02)
But at some point, you gotta release it to get to the heel. To attack. So, when I release it, I'm gonna focus on his knee.

(41:02 - 41:06)
Slow him down. Good. And then we bring our head forward.

(41:07 - 41:11)
So your head is inside his leg. Okay. Now, put your head down on the floor.

(41:12 - 41:17)
Use it as a post. And use the post to attack the heel hook. And then roll.

(41:17 - 41:21)
Ah, it's really obvious. Roll through on it. Keep rolling.

(41:22 - 41:25)
And now you have the winning position. I got it. Beautiful.

(41:25 - 41:29)
Well done. So, one more time. Let's just change the angle.

(41:29 - 41:41)
Because when my head goes to the floor, it's perfect to get a heel hook, right? So, from here, I'm gonna step back. And release my knee on the ground. I'm gonna go here.

(41:41 - 41:48)
And yeah, to prevent him to roll, I control his leg over here. Right? Let's just change the angle here. So make sure everyone can see.

(41:49 - 41:57)
Okay. Then, at some point, I gotta attack his leg. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna start opening up and make sure to control his knee over here.

(41:57 - 42:14)
And then I can even use a hook over there, okay? But when I start going there, he's gonna start getting out, right? So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna place my head on the ground. And this is the detail that I wanna make sure the camera covers. So can you just go for it? And you fix whatever I'm doing here.

(42:14 - 42:21)
John, if you wanna do anything, go ahead. Right. So, I'm gonna keep my head under his knee.

(42:21 - 42:27)
It's correct? Good. Then I go there. Then when my head is on the ground, it fits perfectly here, right? Perfect.

(42:27 - 42:34)
Yeah, yeah, that's awesome. Now he's gonna keep rolling. Now, can you roll him? Now he's, he's done.

(42:34 - 42:42)
Now he's rolling. Yeah, this is, this is really, really strong. That spot where I have my head on the ground, his foot is like.

(42:43 - 42:49)
So, in answer to your question, what's the number one detail in that position? It's the head. It's head first. I got it.

(42:49 - 43:01)
Your head must be inside his leg in order to get to the heel. Right. And the easiest way to ensure that it stays inside throughout a rolling situation is to post on the floor.

(43:01 - 43:13)
That way you stop him from rolling while you can still move when you have two free hands. And as a result, you can quickly get to the lock and finish. So, how I lock my legs, it's gonna be like this triangle of a stretch.

(43:13 - 43:20)
Doesn't even matter too much. Not too much. The truth is that from foot to foot and the various encounters, you can break someone in any one of those positions.

(43:21 - 43:30)
But, our general preference for maximising breaking power is to lock an inside saccadal triangle. A triangle? Yeah. And you have two choices.

(43:30 - 43:43)
You can have the triangle with your feet inside your opponent's legs or the triangle inside the leg and the foot outside the leg. That's the tightest, but it does restrict your mobility a little bit. There's pros and cons to each of their level.

(43:44 - 43:48)
But the head inside the heel is the main thing. That's how you're gonna get to the heel. I got it.

(43:48 - 43:50)
Yeah, that's really good. Thank you again. You're welcome.

(43:54 - 44:07)
We're looking at the idea of entering into leg attacks when we're on top of our training partner. We see the fundamental division of situations where my opponent is seated or where my opponent is supine. Let's look now at the supine situation.

(44:07 - 44:24)
My opponent's down on his back and working. If my opponent has any skills, he'll have his knees close to his chest working in a situation like this and we've got to enter into the legs and get work done. As a general rule, the more extended my opponent's legs are, the easier it is for me to enter into the legs and get to a winning position.

(44:26 - 44:44)
Probably the single most fundamental and well-known method of entering into the legs in these situations are sliding methods. Unfortunately, there's a common set of mistakes that often result in failure. Sliding entries used to get a very bad rap in the early days of judo.

(44:44 - 45:09)
People would say, well, if I am on top of my opponent and I fall back with my opponent's leg, is the chance he's going to come up on top and I'm going to lose position? There's always some danger of you losing position with the leg lock on top position, but it's no more dangerous than going for an armbar from mountain, losing top position from there. It can happen in any position, not just leg locks. Now, we need some kind of effective method of entry.

(45:09 - 45:19)
If my opponent has his feet close together, it's going to be very hard for me to step in and gain the inside position. It's the prerequisite to leg lock activity. So we need methods of getting our opponent's feet apart.

(45:19 - 45:31)
And one of the best ways to do that is some kind of fake toriando attack. I'm going to go in on my training partner, I'm going to get control of my training partner's two shins, start actions of turning my training partner. So it looks like I'm threatening some kind of pass.

(45:32 - 45:46)
Off that pass, I'm going to go foot to foot, and then from here, I'm going to step my foot to the inside position. Critically, my foot is stepped up all the way to my training partner's knee line. That's the line, as we've seen already, that joins my training partner's knees.

(45:47 - 46:14)
The single most common mistake I see in this situation is people don't step to the knee line. And as a result, when they go to fall back, there's too much space between themselves and their opponent, okay? You can clearly see that my feet are not on the knee line, so that when I go backwards with a fall, he sits up with me, and you'll end up in bottom position. Okay? And this was the fundamental complaint used against this kind of leg locking action for many, many years.

(46:15 - 46:39)
These problems are easy to overcome, and even in a worst case scenario, where your opponent does get up on top of you, you're still going to see that leads into other good ways to get into the legs. So, what do we need? First, we need to open up the feet that we get to the knee line successfully, okay? From here, we've seen that any kind of toriando pass will do that very, very well. As I start a passing action on my training partner, it opens up my training partner's feet.

(46:39 - 46:56)
We're in a perfect position now to take one hand and lift my training partner's heel above my hip. I don't want to go into my opponent's legs when the feet are below my hips. It's too easy for him to hook in, and now he is the inside position, okay? That's going to prevent me from getting to the leg.

(46:56 - 47:05)
So instead, we're going to lift the foot to the hip, and we're going to go into a two-on-one grip. The two-on-one grip is here. One hand cups my training partner's knee.

(47:06 - 47:31)
I step past my training partner's hip line, just like so. We're in the perfect position now to sit so close to my training partner's hips that from here, it's very, very hard for him to come up on top of us, okay? And very easy for us to go into any form of leg location that we'd like. Specifically, I like to take my foot across my training partner's legs in this situation.

(47:31 - 47:52)
So when he tries to come up on top, it's very, very easy for me to put pressure, this forces my training partner to move low and gives us one of our favourite breaking positions. Once again. So the situation where we have a supine opponent, the feet are close together, and the legs are retracted.

(47:52 - 48:09)
That's going to make any kind of leg-lock entry very difficult. So first, we open our training partner up by generating motion through some kind of fake toriandou passing, which starts to separate the legs. Now from here, I catch and lift above the hip, and catch, just in like so.

(48:09 - 48:37)
So my knee is resting on my training partner's hip. That means that when my second foot comes up to the line of my opponent's hip, we sit back in a way that is very, very controlling and very easy for me to pass my foot across my training partner's foot instead. When he tries to come up towards me, that reaping action makes it very easy to hook onto our training partner, rotate the man through, and as a result, we end up with very strong breaks down the mat.

(48:44 - 49:16)
Now, we just looked at the theory of taking a supine opponent, falling into the legs and getting to the outside heel hook for a decisive finish. No matter how good you get at any given move, there's always going to be a day you make an error, a mistake, and things that go your way. If I'm on top position, and I fall back into my opponent's legs, and for whatever reason, I've made some kind of mistake, and he gets up on top of me, it's tempting to think, oh, failure, your opponent was on bottom, now he's on top of you.

(49:17 - 49:43)
In fact, it's not so much a failure as an opportunity to go into the legs in a different way. If I'm working against a supine opponent, and I use some kind of toriando action to separate my training partner's feet, I come in, we saw the idea of stepping in on our training partner, and locking up like so. Let's say I'm a day late and a dollar short, and my training partner does get up on top of me.

(49:43 - 49:55)
We know exactly what to do from here. We get the cross body position. As a result, it's very easy for me to start an action of lifting, of bending, and putting him down into our favourite positions.

(49:56 - 50:17)
Just because you've lost sense of top and bottom doesn't mean you can't be effective with leg locks. Always remember, the leg lock entries are equally effective from top or bottom position. Should you experience failure in the top position falling backwards, it will still be just as easy for you to elevate your opponent and go back into the legs in the ways we spent a considerable amount of time looking at.

(50:17 - 50:30)
Once again, we move in on our training partner. From here, we're in the perfect position to establish a two-on-one control. We control the hip, like so.

(50:31 - 50:44)
As we fall, our opponent gets up with us, we tuck into my fore-back, no problem. We have a cross body position. My second foot goes through, knees to chest, lift, elevate, and down.

(50:50 - 51:09)
We're looking at the idea of entering into our training partner's legs when we're in the top position and our opponent's in a two-on-one position down on his back. We've seen situations like this. The primary method of entering is to use some kind of passing pressure to create a situation where I can get inside a space between my opponent's knees and enter into their legs.

(51:09 - 51:27)
Another method is to completely go outside my opponent's legs. If I stand with no legs inside my opponent's legs and he has no feet inside my legs, we're essentially neutral in regards to inside position. I don't have inside position and neither does he.

(51:28 - 51:41)
Believe it or not, this is actually a very good position to enter into one form of leg lock. The advantage of having inside position is that I have many forms of leg lock that I can use from here. I can attack both legs with many forms of leg lock.

(51:41 - 51:50)
Here, I can only attack one leg with one form of leg lock. That's the bad news. The good news is the ones I got from here is a damn good one.

(51:51 - 52:17)
When in a situation where I'm lined up with my training partner, we've got to focus always on getting our opponent's foot above our head. If his foot is below the head, it's so easy for him to take an inside position and stalk in my tracks. So in any situation where I create both of my legs on the outside of his, usually with some kind of toriando pressure, from here, I catch my training partner in the knee and I go to post my hand on the floor.

(52:18 - 52:38)
At the same time, I take my foot and I place it on my training partner's hip. Do not make this common mistake. Too often, I see people too upright and they put their foot in like this and it's just an unholy disaster, okay, where you just look completely clumsy in the middle of a satisfactory leg lock on someone.

(52:39 - 52:47)
The problem is I'm too upright. I have too far to go to throw my leg. I want to be down low and I measure the distance by putting my hand on the mat.

(52:47 - 53:17)
Off that hand on the mat, my foot becomes unweighted and easily comes up into the inside position. My foot makes contact with the crossbar across my partner's body so that I can use it to pull my body up and either access the secondary leg or if he turns away from me, get my head inside his leg so we can roll through into a winning position. Once again, into this, this way.

(53:21 - 53:39)
From here, previously, we worked inside our training partner's legs. Now, we're working outside our training partner's legs. By coming down low to our training partner and putting a hand on the floor, it becomes possible for me to take my outside foot and place it to the inside.

(53:40 - 53:56)
Just by putting my foot up and over, I hook onto the front leg. When he tries to turn away, we keep the head inside. As it goes to spin, we easily roll through into our favourite position.

(54:01 - 54:32)
We're looking at the skill of entering our training partner's legs in the top position when our opponent is in a supine or lying down position. One of the best means of going into my partner's legs in this situation is to work from the inside of my opponent's legs and spin around the leg to the outside. In a situation where I'm inside my opponent's legs, presumably starting down on two knees or a low squat, from here, I go through and I go to control my training partner's leg.

(54:33 - 54:49)
Traditionally, to hit a guard pass, most people prefer to have the leg up on the shoulder. But for the purposes of entering the legs, it's fine, even better in some ways, to have the leg down on the bicep. Very often, your opponent is resisting the guard pass.

(54:50 - 55:04)
He knows you want the leg up high on the shoulder, and they fight to keep the leg down. That's a great way to set up what we're looking at. From this situation, I'm going to post my leg on the same side so that we get a wedging effect between my wrist and my knee.

(55:05 - 55:23)
From here, we're going to take our hand and post it here on our training partner's chest or even on the floor. I recommend, before we post, that we have our knee off the mat to prevent any kind of potential triangle problems. This way, my knee dominates the inside position and makes triangles somewhat difficult.

(55:24 - 55:36)
From here, I post on my training partner's upper body. I'm going to pick my foot up and put my shin on the inner thigh. As a result, I can easily get my knee to the mat.

(55:37 - 55:51)
Now I take my left elbow and sweep it up to my training partner's ankle. If I don't do that, my opponent can lock a triangle and stop my spin around the leg. So it's important that I prevent him from locking that triangle by elevating the ankle.

(55:52 - 56:10)
My hand goes down to the mat. At the same time, I turn the corner and my right knee is going to ultimately end up being a wedge behind my training partner's knee. In order to do that, I need to make a radical turn all the way around with my knee coming through as a wedge.

(56:10 - 56:25)
My second foot hooks onto my training partner and I catch my training partner's leg and connect it to my chest. My goal is to point my knee always at my opponent's sternum. So as I move out, I point the knee directly at the sternum.

(56:25 - 56:45)
I elevate my training partner's leg, hold it, and from here, I punch through, put biceps over toes, and lock up. As a result, we can go into a full Senkaku and a very strong finish. Once again, I start off inside my training partner's open guard.

(56:46 - 56:54)
I control my training partner's leg just in myself. I put a wedging effect in. I post on my training partner's chest.

(56:54 - 57:01)
From here, I pick up my leg and put my knee down on the floor. I control the ankle. I post on the floor.

(57:02 - 57:16)
I turn the corner and off that turn, come around and point. My knee is a wedge around my training partner's leg. I pass the foot across so that I can point my knee at my training partner's sternum.

(57:17 - 57:25)
As I lock my triangle, I catch one, punch through. He wants to turn everything this way. That's the route of his escape.

(57:25 - 57:33)
So I invert, pointing my thumb down. I go over my training partner's toes. I touch my own back.

(57:33 - 57:55)
So when he goes to turn in this direction, he'll break his own leg. As a result, we can quickly lock up and finish. We just looked at what we call an inside-out entry into a nice heel hook variation.

(57:56 - 58:09)
We started inside our opponent's knees and finished up outside our opponent's knees to go into an inside heel hook. Let's look now at the exact opposite. We just went inside-out.

(58:09 - 58:21)
Now let's go outside-in. In a situation where our opponent is supine and working in front of us, we get control of our training partner. This time, we put the leg on the shoulder, a more conventional passing position.

(58:22 - 58:38)
I'm gonna put my hand here on my training partner's chest. Normally, when we're looking to pass, we're typically either controlling down here at the hip or in the cases with a gi, across the opposite shoulder. But from here, I'm not interested in passing my opponent's legs, so I'm just gonna post on my training partner's chest.

(58:39 - 58:53)
My second hand forms a V, and I put that V inside my training partner's hamstring. I don't put my hand here like this, where you can pull the hand forward. It's not causing triangle problems for me, okay? So we lock up like so.

(58:53 - 59:12)
Now, I'm gonna pop up and widen my base. My hips will be the same height as my head. I'm gonna do a simple skip step where my right foot skips outside my training partner's buttocks and points in the same direction my opponent is facing, like so.

(59:13 - 59:25)
So my foot points out in the direction his legs are pointing. Don't have your foot come forward pointing forward. You're gonna have to point your toes in the same direction his feet are pointing.

(59:27 - 59:52)
As I do this, watch my left foot. Right foot goes, left foot moves. Essentially, what I'm doing is I'm unweighting my left foot all the weight is going onto my right foot and my right foot is setting up a rotation so that I can spin from the outside of my opponent's legs to the inside.

(59:53 - 1:00:22)
So once again, from a situation where you're passing open guard, we drop down, get a hold of our training partner, and go into this classic attacking position. As I make my skip step, I'm gonna whip my leg around his and I'm going to hug my opponent's lower leg and I'm gonna land right out here to his side. Notice how I connect my opponent's shin to my chest.

(1:00:22 - 1:00:47)
If Kyle goes in the one direction he needs for escape, it's impossible because his shin is connected to my chest. Now I point my knee at his sternum, I punch through, bicep over toes, we lock, senkaku, and finish. Once again, from open guard scenario, we go in on our training partner's legs.

(1:00:48 - 1:01:07)
I palm away arm through underneath, my hand goes to my training partner's sternum and we pop up. This creates light, mobile legs which will enable us to make a quick turn. As I move around my opponent, my right foot sets up the angle and the left foot becomes unweighted.

(1:01:10 - 1:01:25)
I fall next to him, making sure that his shin is connected to my chest. As a result, we can lock senkaku and point the knee directly at the sternum. I control the foot, I know what he wants, he wants to rotate this way.

(1:01:26 - 1:01:43)
So I make sure we get the bicep, touch my own back, lock, and finish. Here's the most common mistakes that I see with this movement. People will have an uncontrolled landing, crashing across their opponent's body.

(1:01:48 - 1:02:00)
Here, there's no control of the leg, it comes out above you, and it's a disaster. The landing is essentially uncontrolled. But where you land is controlled.

(1:02:01 - 1:02:18)
You want to fall on the same side as the leg you've attacked. It's also very important, you don't fall down towards his legs, you fall forwards towards his head. That's what will enable you to keep his lower back off the floor and prevent him turning out and escaping the subsequent heel hook.

(1:02:19 - 1:02:35)
So once again, we start off, and opponent in open guard. We go through, lock, hand goes to chest, second hand blocks. Making sure we block properly, not naively like this where I can be pulled forward into triangles.

(1:02:36 - 1:02:55)
I block, hands up. From here, a skip step, followed by an unweighted leg, and then a fall that takes his hips off the floor. When he goes to turn away from me, it's almost impossible because I'm controlling the shins to my chest.

(1:02:56 - 1:03:10)
If I didn't have that, my opponent would quickly try my legs, move, et cetera, et cetera, and defend himself. I want his leg extended. His escape route is this way, so I point my knee right there at his sternum.

(1:03:11 - 1:03:25)
Now, I go inside and around. When he goes to turn in this direction, his own toes will prevent the turn. Then we lock, sentate, and finish.

(1:03:30 - 1:03:42)
We're looking at practical applications of all the leg lock theory we've seen up until this point. There are four main scenarios that you will be using entrances into leg locks. We've seen standing position.

(1:03:43 - 1:03:55)
We've seen ground position bottom. We're looking at ground position top. Let's look now to a fourth, very common scenario, especially once you start dealing more and more with leg locks and your training partners are, too.

(1:03:55 - 1:04:25)
When you first see this position, it looks kind of artificial, but once you start getting deep into the leg lock game, you'll find it occurring more and more often with you and your training partners. Even in regular jiu-jitsu competition, this position occurs all the time just because, in many cases, you'll have opponents who pull guard at the same time together, or one of them gets swept as they try to pass a guard, and the two athletes end up seated in front of each other. I often refer to this as the double-seated position.

(1:04:26 - 1:04:42)
Double-seated position refers to any situation where you have two athletes sitting in front of each other, and his knee line is here, my knee line is here. We are both outside of each other's knee line. Our knee lines have not crossed.

(1:04:43 - 1:04:49)
Here, I'm in a national garage. Our knee lines have crossed. We're that close.

(1:04:50 - 1:05:04)
In double-seated, we're not that close. There's still some distance between us, okay? In situations like this, if I'm interested in the leg lock game, I will always be looking to get my feet in the inside position. Currently, I've actually had that, I've achieved it.

(1:05:05 - 1:05:32)
But your opponent, if he's interested in leg locks, will be looking to do the same thing. So most of the time, when we start off in these situations, typically it'll be one leg for him inside and one leg for me inside. The question is, how am I gonna get two legs inside, or how am I gonna take advantage of this in some way if I have no legs inside? How am I gonna save myself instead of Sarah? What should I be trying to do in this double-seated position, okay? Well, the first thing I'm gonna do is put a brake on his ability to pommel his legs inside.

(1:05:33 - 1:05:55)
So the first thing I'll do is I'll take my hand and I will hug my opponent's foot to my thigh, okay? So if I have my opponent trying to pommel his leg inside, I don't grab my opponent's foot like this with my thumb and hold. The human hand is not strong enough to hold a leg. He will easily kick out and pommel his foot to the inside position.

(1:05:56 - 1:06:16)
Instead, what I do is I take an open hand and I hug his ankle to my thigh, and I use the strength of my extending leg to hold him in place. When he goes to pommel out, it's a damn sight more difficult than it was before. Presumably, he's holding my foot in the same way, okay? Now, to get inside position, I'm gonna take my hand and strip his grip.

(1:06:17 - 1:06:25)
As a result, I can pommel my foot to the inside. Where I pommel my foot to the inside is of the greatest importance. I have two choices.

(1:06:26 - 1:06:43)
I can either go straight buttock, my right foot to my opponent's left buttock. In this particular scenario, this is highly undesirable. Why? Because it creates a situation where there's a tremendous space between my knees, and my two knees are pointing in different directions.

(1:06:44 - 1:07:36)
As a result, this is extremely easy for the kama sara to re-pommel and put his foot on the inside and start threatening me, okay? So, once I get my foot to the inside, I wanna go to a cross buttock position where my right foot goes to the right buttock, like so. This dramatically lessens the space between my knees so that when kama sara tries to re-pommel inside, as he fights in, it's the easiest thing in the world for me to clear the foot out, okay? Making sure that when we pommel in from this situation, that we go to a cross buttock is a big part of success in this situation. Now, once I've established a cross buttock position, I have two feet on the inside, always remember, two prerequisites are required to go into the ashi garana in the end, not one.

(1:07:36 - 1:07:45)
Inside position is never enough by itself. You must also have distance. If the distance isn't correct, I'll never get to the ashi garana.

(1:07:46 - 1:08:02)
If I sat where I am, I'm outside my opponent's knee line, I'll never get to a satisfactory ashi garana. I'll never get my opponent's knee inside my knee line. The first thing we have to do is to establish a two-on-one grip and use our feet to pull our hips up to our opponent's knee line.

(1:08:04 - 1:08:17)
Once we've done that, now we can enter an ashi garana. I go through and pull my opponent's leg on and form wedges around my training partner's legs. You can clearly see his knee is well within my knee line at this point.

(1:08:18 - 1:08:34)
As a result, I can easily pass my foot across and start exposing my training partner's heel. From here, we roll through and we find ourselves in a wing position. Let's have a look at those main concepts again.

(1:08:35 - 1:08:56)
From a situation where we start double seated, we both have hands on each other's ankles, I want double inside position, both of my feet inside his feet. Currently, I have only one. So I'm gonna come down, strip my training partner's grip, and start the action of pomoing to the inside position.

(1:08:56 - 1:09:10)
I always pomo to the cross buttock, my left to his left, my right to his right. If I go straight buttock, there's so much space between my knees, you could drive a truck through that space. It's easy for him to re-pomo back to safety.

(1:09:11 - 1:09:23)
I go cross buttock and I close my knees. So when he goes to re-pomo, I can easily remove the foot. Now, I have double inside position with my feet, but I need now to close distance.

(1:09:24 - 1:09:42)
I need to breach my opponent's, or penetrate my opponent's knee line with my hips. So I get a two-on-one grip, and I use my feet to pull myself up from my opponent's knee line. As a result, I can easily control my training partner's leg, form wedges around it with a tight, ushered around him.

(1:09:43 - 1:09:49)
I expose my training partner's heel. Off that heel exposure, we control the far hip. We go to roll through.

(1:09:49 - 1:10:22)
We go to the next one, outside out figure eight. We're looking at this very commonly occurring double seated position, which as you climb further and further into the leg lock game, will become more and more a part of your daily training. A common mistake that many beginning athletes will make in double seated positions, is they will assume that once you get into the double seated position, you have to stay on your seat.

(1:10:23 - 1:10:40)
There's no rule that says you have to stay where you are once you get into this position. One of my favourite things to do in this situation is to change levels on my training partner. This is particularly useful whenever you have a skilled pommeler working against you who's very good at pommeling their feet in opposition to your feet.

(1:10:40 - 1:11:26)
So if I have an opponent in front of me, we both have one foot inside, and from here I go to separate my training partner's grips and I go to pommel in, but he does a good job of re-pommeling, and you feel like I can't get any kind of consistent inside position on this guy, okay? I pommel inside, I go cross-butter, he pommels inside, comes in, gets inside position, and now you feel like, man, I can't make any forward progress on this guy, okay? One of my favourite things to do in situations like this, once I get a foot inside on my training partner, is to pull the foot back to myself. I don't try to pommel in towards my opponent's legs, I pommel underneath my own leg. This means I'll have one foot forward and one foot back.

(1:11:26 - 1:11:56)
That will immediately frustrate his ability to pommel his feet inside, I'll control him like so. So what do they all start doing? They start coming forward and hand-fighting on their feet, pulling, et cetera, pulling on my head, et cetera, he's coming closer to me, that's what I'm looking for, okay? I get a hold of my training partner's collar, I release my training partner's foot and I bring my head forward up to my training partner's knee line. As a result, I can go into a simple hip flex where I drive up to my knee and I start bringing my foot forward on my training partner.

(1:11:56 - 1:12:15)
Sorry, my knee forward on my training partner. I catch my training partner like so, as I extend, I lift, and then from here, we find ourselves in a perfect kind of symmetry, directly into our training partner's legs. In this sense, I only needed one foot inside my opponent's legs in order to get the leg win.

(1:12:16 - 1:12:28)
So we start off in a situation like so. I feel, for whatever reason, it's very difficult for me to win a pommeling battle against this man. So I free my foot, I go to a cross-body position.

(1:12:29 - 1:12:46)
From here, he tries to re-pommel in, finds it difficult because my knees are very close together. Now, from here, I'll pull my foot back underneath my own leg, so there's simply no weapon to pommel into. As a result, there's nothing to stop me from coming forward on my opponent and nor stopping him from coming forward on me.

(1:12:47 - 1:13:06)
So we typically end up in situations like this, very close. Now, I had a quick hip heist, where I pop up to my knee like so, I start driving forward on my training partner. I have a choice now between catching this leg or going through underneath my own knee and catching this leg using a hand assist.

(1:13:07 - 1:13:18)
The advantage of gripping this leg is you get a stronger control of the kani basami. The disadvantage is you don't control the secondary leg at the end of the move. You take your pick, they're both very good options.

(1:13:19 - 1:13:37)
Once again, from a situation where I feel I'm not really making much forward progress, it's time to switch strategies and employ a level change. I strip a hand and go to cross body. He holds on tight, I strip the hand and I put the foot underneath my own body.

(1:13:37 - 1:13:45)
So there's no space for him to pommel in, there's no inside space for him to exploit. So he's got to find other means to fight. They often come forward with the hands, et cetera, et cetera.

(1:13:45 - 1:13:57)
I catch my training partner, I post, and then from here I make a choice between gripping either this leg, so that I end up with an ankle lace, or this leg for a very strong kani basami.
