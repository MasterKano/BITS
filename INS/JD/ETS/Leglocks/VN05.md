# VIEWING NOTES — ETS Leg Locks

## 5.0 Volume 5

### 5.1 Introduction (0:00–14:11)
- Key concepts
  - Transition from straight ashi (shared spiral problem) to cross ashi as a distinct subsystem with distinct central problems.
  - Cross ashi framed as a highly controlling/pin-like entanglement relative to other leg positions (positional value emphasis).
  - The “central problem” for cross ashi is framed around opponent escape mechanics that must be addressed systematically.
- Position–structure
  - Cross ashi introduced as a different alignment of the opponent’s leg across your centerline/hip line compared to straight ashi.
- Key cues
  - Treat cross ashi as its own entity: do not assume straight-ashi solutions transfer unchanged.
- Drills
  - “Subsystem recognition” reps: partner gives you straight-ashi vs cross-ashi alignment; you identify which subsystem you’re in and state the expected main escape.
- System tags
  - cross ashi; subsystem framing; positional hierarchy; escape-first thinking

### 5.2 Similarities & differences of straight and cross ashi (14:11–18:04)
- Key concepts
  - Both systems depend on: inside position → connection → knee line → heel exposure → resistance management → breaking.
  - Straight vs cross differs in alignment (centerline relationship), typical escape direction, and how you must manage the opponent’s “turning” response.
  - Cross ashi increases certain control qualities but creates a different dominant escape (turnout framing appears repeatedly later).
- Position–structure
  - Straight ashi: alignment more centerline/hip-facing.
  - Cross ashi: opponent’s leg crosses your centerline and changes how their hip/knee can rotate.
- Key cues
  - Don’t use “one finish fits all”: identify whether your finishing mechanics are opposing their escape direction.
- Drills
  - Alternate rounds: 2 minutes straight-ashi emphasis, 2 minutes cross-ashi emphasis; same goal each round (heel exposure), compare what the opponent does to hide/turn.
- System tags
  - straight vs cross; alignment; escape direction; gates model

### 5.3 Primary & secondary leg (18:04–19:38)
- Key concepts
  - Define roles: primary leg (the attacked/captured leg) vs secondary leg (the free leg that can interfere, peel, step, or change angles).
  - Cross ashi problems are frequently driven by secondary-leg behavior (interference, stepping, peeling).
  - Decision point: when to commit attention/resources to secondary-leg control versus progressing on the primary leg.
- Position–structure
  - Cross ashi typically starts as primary-leg dominant, then must account for secondary-leg interference as the exchange develops.
- Key cues
  - If the secondary leg becomes “active,” treat it as a structural problem, not a distraction.
- Drills
  - “Secondary-leg interference” reps: partner’s only job is to use the free leg to peel/step/turn; your job is to maintain your preferred control long enough to progress one step (e.g., heel exposure).
- System tags
  - primary vs secondary leg; interference management; decision points

### 5.4 Double & single leg approaches (19:38–21:55)
- Key concepts
  - Single-leg approach: commit to the primary leg and finish—fast but can be vulnerable to common cross-ashi escapes.
  - Double-leg approach: collect/control both legs to limit the opponent’s strongest escape(s), at the cost of added complexity.
  - The system frames double-leg collection as a response to the opponent’s dominant cross-ashi escape behavior.
- Position–structure
  - Single-leg: primary leg controlled, secondary leg relatively free.
  - Double-leg: secondary leg is brought into the entanglement to reduce rotation/turnout and stabilize the position.
- Key cues
  - When the opponent’s escape is predictable and repeatable, consider upgrading from single-leg to double-leg control.
- Drills
  - “Upgrade drill”: start in a single-leg cross-ashi look; partner initiates the common escape; you must upgrade to double-leg control before attempting any finishing mechanics.
- System tags
  - single vs double leg control; upgrades; escape-driven transitions

### 5.5 Turnout problem (21:55–26:28)
- Key concepts
  - Central cross-ashi escape framed as “turnout”: the opponent turns the knee/foot away to reduce exposure and create space/angles.
  - Turnout is treated as inevitable (“it has to happen”)—the system is a structured response to that inevitability.
  - A recurring response theme appears: stay connected, don’t rush heat; manage movement/control first, then attack.
- Position–structure
  - Turnout changes the heel/foot relationship and threatens both heel exposure and knee-line integrity.
- Key cues
  - When turnout begins, prioritize control of rotation + knee line rather than forcing finish pressure.
- Drills
  - “Turnout trigger” reps: start cross ashi; partner’s only action is turnout; your job is to maintain control and re-establish your preferred attacking alignment (freeze when stable).
- System tags
  - turnout; rotation control; knee line; control-before-heat

### 5.6 Double leg approach — ankle lace ashi (26:28–30:18)
- Key concepts
  - Ankle lace ashi presented as a double-leg configuration that strongly controls opponent movement and reduces turnout success.
  - Double-leg control can create a platform to re-access heel exposure and/or transition into heel-hook finishing positions.
  - The advantage is framed as control quality (“control movement in a way which no …”)—i.e., strong immobilization relative to alternatives.
- Position–structure
  - Both legs are “laced” to trap/control both of the opponent’s legs/ankles, changing their ability to rotate/step.
- Key cues
  - Use ankle lace to solve turnout by controlling the secondary leg, not by “fighting harder” on the primary leg.
- Drills
  - “Lace acquisition” reps: start from a cross-ashi look; partner begins turnout; you lace the secondary leg and hold ankle lace control for 5–10 seconds before reset.
- System tags
  - ankle lace ashi; double-leg control; anti-turnout; immobilization

### 5.7 Release problem (30:18–32:09)
- Key concepts
  - New derivative problem created by strong double-leg control: “release” (opponent attempts to free/release a trapped leg to break your control platform).
  - Tradeoff framing: controlling the secondary leg prevents turnout, but creates release dynamics you must address.
  - Release is treated as a predictable response that needs a technical solution (not an “oops” moment).
- Position–structure
  - Release attempts target the integrity of your lace/entanglement—often via peeling, pulling, or re-threading the leg line.
- Key cues
  - Expect release attempts as soon as the opponent feels turnout is being shut down.
- Drills
  - “Release reaction” reps: you establish ankle lace; partner’s only job is to free one leg; your job is to maintain lace integrity and re-secure before reset.
- System tags
  - release problem; entanglement integrity; retention

### 5.8 Managing the release (32:09–36:46)
- Key concepts
  - Grip detail emphasis: feed the hand in and keep the working grip below key demarcations (below ankle appears as a repeated rule elsewhere).
  - Use tight wedge/locking structure around the ankles to reduce the opponent’s ability to extract.
  - Achilles/foot control appears as part of the retention toolkit (not only as “a finish”).
- Position–structure
  - Manage release by combining: correct hand placement + ankle wedge + leg structure that prevents easy leg withdrawal.
- Key cues
  - When the opponent fights the release, “re-seat” your grip and structure rather than chasing the leg with extended arms.
- Drills
  - “Seat the grip” reps: partner initiates release; you re-feed hand position and re-lock ankle wedge before attempting any attack.
- System tags
  - release management; grip demarcation; ankle wedge; retention mechanics

### 5.9 Alternative achilles grip (36:46–41:38)
- Key concepts
  - Alternative Achilles grip presented as a way to stay connected as the opponent turns/pulls away (connection-first, then pressure).
  - The grip is used as a control/retention method in the face of turnout/release dynamics.
  - The system continues to emphasize “stay on the leg” so the opponent cannot simply turn/pull free.
- Position–structure
  - Grip change/variation used to preserve attachment when the opponent’s rotational line changes.
- Key cues
  - Don’t sacrifice connection for a “perfect” finish grip; use an alternative grip to keep the leg captured, then upgrade.
- Drills
  - “Grip switching under turn” reps: partner turns out/pulls away; you switch to alternative Achilles grip, then return to your preferred control once stabilized.
- System tags
  - alternative Achilles grip; connection preservation; grip upgrades

### 5.10 Double heel hook attack (41:38–45:06)
- Key concepts
  - If the opponent commits resources to defending one leg/heel (peeling grips, turning), the secondary leg can become attackable.
  - Double-attack framing: threaten primary heel hook; if defense opens the secondary leg, attack secondary (dilemma logic).
  - Dilemma creation: opponent cannot fully solve both threats simultaneously if control is maintained.
- Position–structure
  - Two-leg control platforms (e.g., ankle lace / cross-ashi variations) enable switching between legs without losing entanglement.
- Key cues
  - When the opponent’s hands are busy peeling, treat that as a cue to switch targets rather than “fight the peel.”
- Drills
  - “Two-target flow” reps: start with heel access on one leg; partner peels; you switch the attack line to the other leg’s heel control and freeze.
- System tags
  - double heel hook; dilemma chains; switching targets; peel punishment

### 5.11 Lace leg (creating dilemma) (45:06–47:59)
- Key concepts
  - Lacing the leg is used to manufacture dilemmas: opponent’s turnout/release responses are constrained, creating predictable openings.
  - Lace action functions as both: (1) immobilization, and (2) attack creation (opening heel access or Achilles exposure).
  - The system frames lace as an “attack platform” rather than only a holding mechanic.
- Position–structure
  - Lace changes the geometry: it reduces free rotation and narrows the opponent’s escape lanes.
- Key cues
  - Lace to limit the opponent’s best escape, then choose attack based on what they give you (heel vs ankle vs transition).
- Drills
  - “Lace to choice” reps: establish lace; partner chooses either turnout attempt or peel attempt; you respond with the prescribed attack switch (heel/ankle/transition) and freeze.
- System tags
  - lacing; dilemmas; constrained escapes; attack selection

### 5.12 Splitter hand (47:59–53:50)
- Key concepts
  - Splitter-hand concept: manage two feet/ankles in close quarters by inserting/positioning the hand to separate and control.
  - Used as a retention/grip-fighting tool when both feet are in the same control zone (e.g., near armpit/torso).
  - Enables you to maintain control long enough to apply the next step (heel exposure or breaking position assembly).
- Position–structure
  - Splitter hand creates “order” when both feet are clustered: prevents the opponent from stacking both feet into a unified escape.
- Key cues
  - If both feet are fighting in the same space, use a structure (splitter hand) rather than chasing foot-to-foot reactions.
- Drills
  - “Two-feet control” reps: partner alternates feet to peel/turn; you maintain splitter hand control and prevent both feet moving together.
- System tags
  - splitter hand; two-feet management; grip fighting; retention

### 5.13 Elbow slicer (53:50–57:17)
- Key concepts
  - Elbow-based control/attack used to reinforce retention and create damage/pressure opportunities when grips are contested.
  - Elbow placement functions as a wedge: improves control of foot/ankle alignment under resistance.
  - Continues the theme: build structure that survives peeling before you attempt final breaking effort.
- Position–structure
  - Elbow becomes a control post/wedge that stabilizes the leg line while hands work for grips.
- Key cues
  - If the opponent is winning the hand fight, reinforce with elbow wedges rather than escalating a losing grip battle.
- Drills
  - “Elbow wedge retention” reps: partner peels hands; you maintain alignment using elbow placement and re-secure your preferred grip.
- System tags
  - elbow slicer; elbow wedge; retention under peel

### 5.14 Over under method (57:17–1:02:01)
- Key concepts
  - Over–under framing used for grip retention and steering the opponent while maintaining heel/ankle control.
  - Over–under helps prevent the opponent from stripping grips by creating layered control points (not a single fragile hold).
  - The method supports off-balancing/tilting while maintaining the entanglement (control + movement).
- Position–structure
  - Over–under acts as a “grip architecture” that keeps the opponent’s foot/heel tethered to your torso line.
- Key cues
  - Use over–under to keep contact when the opponent’s hands are aggressively peeling.
- Drills
  - “Peel survival” rounds: partner uses both hands to strip grips; attacker must retain control using over–under framing for 10 seconds, then reset.
- System tags
  - over–under; grip architecture; peel resistance; steering

### 5.15 Double elbow (1:02:01–1:04:21)
- Key concepts
  - Double-elbow framing emphasizes wedging both ankles/feet in place so rotational escape is slowed and peeling becomes harder.
  - Creates strong “attachment” even if a hand grip momentarily degrades (structure > grip).
  - Used to re-enter preferred heel/ankle grips once the opponent’s escape speed is reduced.
- Position–structure
  - Both elbows contribute to stabilizing the ankle/foot line, helping maintain the entanglement during transitions.
- Key cues
  - When escape speed increases, prioritize structures that slow the opponent down (double elbows), then rebuild grips.
- Drills
  - “Slow then grip” reps: partner turns/pulls; you apply double-elbow wedging to slow movement, then re-lock your preferred finishing grip.
- System tags
  - double elbow; wedging; slow-the-escape; grip rebuild

### 5.16 Double cross method (1:04:21–1:07:46)
- Key concepts
  - Double-cross configurations stack/cross the opponent’s legs to limit base and constrain movement (setup for switching attacks).
  - The method is framed as both a control solution and an attack-enabler (improves heel access and target switching).
  - Head/positioning considerations appear: your effectiveness depends on staying in a position where you can apply force and maintain control as they turn.
- Position–structure
  - Legs arranged into stacked/crossed patterns → movement constraints → attack selection between legs.
- Key cues
  - Build the crossed configuration to reduce the opponent’s ability to freely re-orient hips and legs.
- Drills
  - “Cross-stack build” reps: start from cross-ashi; build double-cross leg arrangement; partner attempts to unwind; you maintain for 5–10 seconds then reset.
- System tags
  - double cross; leg stacking; movement constraint; switching platform

### 5.17 Controlling shared spiral (1:07:46–1:15:47)
- Key concepts
  - Shared spiral returns as a late-phase problem: attacker and defender can spiral in the same direction, enabling escape.
  - Solution emphasis: slow the opponent’s turning rather than trying to speed yourself up.
  - A specific sequence is framed as a “slowdown chain”:
    - apply a hand break / control
    - add a second point of leg control
    - head to the floor as a post/anchor
    - roll mechanics that keep connection while reducing opponent’s speed advantage
- Position–structure
  - Spiral control depends on maintaining connection while changing the rolling/posting mechanics (avoid stalling on poor posts that slow you).
- Key cues
  - If the opponent’s turn is “too fast,” don’t chase—add structures that reduce their speed first, then follow-through.
- Drills
  - “Spiral slowdown” drill: partner initiates a fast turn; you apply the slowdown chain (hand break → secondary control → head post → connected roll) and freeze once speed is controlled.
- System tags
  - shared spiral; spiral speed control; slowdown chain; follow-through; connection under rotation
