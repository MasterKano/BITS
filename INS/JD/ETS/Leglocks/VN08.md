# VIEWING NOTES — ETS Leg Locks

## 8.0 Volume 8

### 8.1 Sitback (0:00–6:56)
- Key concepts
  - Sitback framed as a core standing-to-legs entry method: you convert a standing leg capture into a seated/entangled control without losing connection.
  - Sitback directionality matters: you sit to a side/hip line so the opponent’s foot/leg does not block your slide pathway.
  - Connection-first principle: maintain leg capture through the sitback; uncontrolled drop creates the release window.
- Position–structure
  - Standing capture (behind knee / ankle control) → angle/space creation → side sitback → immediate leg entanglement build (ashi family depends on alignment).
- Key cues
  - Side sitback (hip line), not flat-back drop.
  - Preserve connection while creating space so you can slide into position.
- Drills
  - Sitback mechanics reps: partner stands with a stable base; you capture and perform side sitback into controlled leg entanglement; reset on foot-blocking or connection loss.
- System tags
  - sitback entry; standing-to-ashi; side slide; spacing vs blocking

### 8.2 Inside Out Entry (6:56–9:50)
- Key concepts
  - “Inside-out” framed as a directional entry: you begin inside alignment then rotate/slide outward into your chosen entanglement as the opponent reacts.
  - Inside positioning is still the gate: you must win interior track before the entry becomes reliable.
- Position–structure
  - Establish inside alignment → initiate sitback/entry motion that exits to the outside channel → build ashi structure.
- Key cues
  - If you lose inside track during the transition, the opponent will step out and you will miss the entanglement.
- Drills
  - Inside-out line reps: start with inside alignment; partner gives light step resistance; you complete inside-out motion and freeze in stable entanglement.
- System tags
  - inside-out entry; inside track; directional entry; entanglement build

### 8.3 Outside In Entry (9:50–13:04)
- Key concepts
  - “Outside-in” framed as a complementary pathway: you approach from the outside channel and bring your body/legs inward to capture the line.
  - The entry addresses cases where direct inside alignment is denied; you create angle first, then insert to the inside.
- Position–structure
  - Outside approach → angle creation → insertion to inside line → sitback/entanglement.
- Key cues
  - Don’t try to “go inside” without creating the angle first; insertion is easier once the opponent’s stance is turned.
- Drills
  - Outside-in insertion reps: partner maintains inside denial; you create outside angle, then insert to inside line and finish sitback into entanglement.
- System tags
  - outside-in entry; angle creation; inside insertion; stance turning

### 8.4 Outside Step In (13:04–17:23)
- Key concepts
  - Outside step-in used as a practical footwork tool to access the leg line while avoiding stepping “between the legs.”
  - The step-in is framed as a safety + control requirement: head and hips must take the correct lane to prevent being collapsed on.
- Position–structure
  - Footwork step-in to outside channel → leg capture → sitback/entanglement.
- Key cues
  - Do not step between the legs; take the outside lane.
  - Get head outside the leg line as part of the entry safety structure.
- Drills
  - Outside-lane step-in reps: start at standing distance; execute outside step-in and leg capture; freeze when head is clearly outside the leg line; reset.
- System tags
  - outside lane; step-in footwork; head outside; safe entry

### 8.5 Half Guard Entries (17:23–26:58)
- Key concepts
  - Half guard framed as a rich entry environment: leg entanglements can be built from established lower-body connections rather than chasing from open distance.
  - The system emphasizes upgrading half-guard grips/frames into inside leg positions and then into ashi family entanglements.
  - Entry quality is tied to controlling the opponent’s balance and limiting their ability to free the trapped leg.
- Position–structure
  - Half guard control (knee shield/underhook/frames depending on scenario) → inside positioning → leg pummeling into entanglement.
- Key cues
  - Don’t abandon half guard control for a loose entry; upgrade your control first (inside position, knee line).
- Drills
  - Half-guard-to-ashi flow: start in half guard; establish inside position; transition to a stable ashi/entanglement and freeze; reset on loss of inside/knee line.
- System tags
  - half guard entries; control upgrade; inside position; pummeling to ashi

### 8.6 Kani Basami (26:58–30:24)
- Key concepts
  - Kani basami presented as a dynamic entry that rapidly creates leg entanglement and inside positioning.
  - Emphasis on landing into control rather than treating it as a “jump to a finish.”
  - Safety/structure implied: correct angle and control on landing are required to avoid being smashed or missing the leg line.
- Position–structure
  - Dynamic scissor entry → immediate entanglement build (ashi family depends on landing alignment) → stabilize before advancing.
- Key cues
  - Land in structure: knee line + connection first; do not rush to heel mechanics mid-flight/landing.
- Drills
  - Controlled kani-basami entries: partner gives compliant stance; perform entry and hold stabilized entanglement for 3 seconds; reset.
- System tags
  - kani basami; dynamic entry; landing stabilization; knee line

### 8.7 Double Seated Position (30:24–45:24)
- Key concepts
  - Double-seated framing: when both players are seated, leg entries become a pummeling/inside-position battle rather than a takedown-style engagement.
  - Priority stack remains: inside position → connection → knee line → heel exposure → escape negation → breaking.
  - Double seated is treated as a high-frequency modern scenario, so systematic pummeling and connector positions become essential.
- Position–structure
  - Seated vs seated: hand fighting + shin-to-shin / butterfly / pummeling → entry into ashi families depending on alignment.
- Key cues
  - Win inside position before committing to entries; if you commit from outside, you get disconnected.
  - Use connector positions (shin-to-shin, seated grips) to maintain attachment and force reactions.
- Drills
  - Double-seated pummeling rounds: start seated; each partner’s goal is to achieve clear inside position and a stable connection for 5 seconds; reset.
  - Connector ladder: shin-to-shin → 2-on-1 leg → ashi entry (freeze at each step, then reset).
- System tags
  - double seated; inside pummeling; connector ladder; modern leg-entry scenario
