# VIEWING NOTES — ETS Leg Locks

## 7.0 Volume 7

### 7.1 Sliding Ashi (0:00–4:58)
- Key concepts
  - Sliding ashi presented as a practical “connector” method to get from initial contact into a usable leg entanglement without losing connection.
  - Emphasis on keeping attachment as the opponent moves: rather than hard re-entries, you slide/re-seat the position.
- Position–structure
  - Entry alignment transitions into a stabilized ashi by re-centering hips and re-threading legs while maintaining grips/connection.
- Key cues
  - Maintain connection during the slide; don’t sacrifice attachment to “perfect” your foot placement.
- Drills
  - Sliding re-seat reps: start in a loose/partial ashi; partner shifts/steps; you slide to re-seat the ashi and freeze when stable.
- System tags
  - sliding ashi; connector; re-seating; connection retention

### 7.2 Colloring Elbow (4:58–8:31)
- Key concepts
  - Collar-and-elbow style tie emphasized as a standing/transition control that feeds clean entries (tie quality matters).
  - Control of head/shoulder line used to create predictable steps/posts that open legs.
- Position–structure
  - Upper-body tie → posture disruption → step reaction → entry window.
- Key cues
  - Tie depth + head position matter more than “hand placement aesthetics.”
- Drills
  - Tie-to-reaction reps: establish collar-and-elbow; force a step/post; freeze at the reaction moment (no entry), then reset.
- System tags
  - collar-and-elbow; posture control; reaction creation; entry setup

### 7.3 Double Leg Entry (8:31–11:46)
- Key concepts
  - Double-leg entry framed as a way to get immediate two-leg control (reduces opponent’s strongest escape options early).
  - The goal is to arrive already controlling both legs rather than winning one leg then chasing the second.
- Position–structure
  - Standing engagement → entry line that connects to both legs → transition to a two-leg control platform (X / reverse-X / double seated).
- Key cues
  - Collect the second leg as you enter; don’t postpone it until the opponent is already stepping away.
- Drills
  - Double-leg collection reps: partner gives light footwork; you enter and must establish two-leg control for 3 seconds before reset.
- System tags
  - double-leg entry; early collection; anti-step; two-leg platform

### 7.4 Single Leg Entry (11:46–16:07)
- Key concepts
  - Single-leg entry is presented as simpler/faster but must be paired with immediate breakdown or upgrade to avoid “walk-out.”
  - Connection and knee-line discipline remain the stabilizers that prevent immediate disengagement.
- Position–structure
  - Entry to one leg → immediate structure (knee line + wedge closure) → breakdown or transition.
- Key cues
  - If the opponent can keep stepping, you must either break them down or upgrade to two-leg control.
- Drills
  - Single-leg entry to checkpoint: enter single-leg control; freeze at knee-line capture; partner attempts to step out; reset when either side wins.
- System tags
  - single-leg entry; knee line; breakdown-or-upgrade rule

### 7.5 Front Headlock (16:07–18:25)
- Key concepts
  - Front headlock shown as a route into leg entries (opponent’s posture compromised, hands occupied, legs become reachable).
  - Head control creates predictable base responses (posts/steps) that expose legs.
- Position–structure
  - Front headlock control → opponent posture reaction → drop/angle change into leg capture.
- Key cues
  - Use the head control to force posture first; don’t abandon the headlock before the reaction appears.
- Drills
  - Front headlock to leg capture: partner begins in front headlock defense; you force a posture reaction, then capture a leg and freeze.
- System tags
  - front headlock; posture compromise; entry pathway

### 7.6 Arm Drag (18:25–21:32)
- Key concepts
  - Arm drag used to expose angle and access legs by pulling the opponent past your centerline.
  - The drag creates a pathway where the opponent must step to recover, opening leg lines.
- Position–structure
  - Arm drag → angle creation → leg access (single/double capture depending on reaction).
- Key cues
  - Drag to create angle; don’t drag “in place.”
- Drills
  - Arm-drag to step: drag until opponent must step; freeze on step; then reset (entry optional).
- System tags
  - arm drag; angle; forced step; entry setup

### 7.7 4 Point Breakdown (21:32–24:02)
- Key concepts
  - “4-point” concept suggests forcing the opponent to hands and feet (or hands/knees) to reduce mobility and create stable entry conditions.
  - Breaking posture/base is treated as the prerequisite to secure entries without being walked out.
- Position–structure
  - Off-balance → hands to mat → collect legs in a more stable environment.
- Key cues
  - If you can force hands down, leg collection becomes higher percentage.
- Drills
  - Breakdown-to-freeze: starting from standing tie, force opponent to a 4-point posture; freeze; reset.
- System tags
  - breakdown; hands-down; posture control; entry stabilization

### 7.8 Intro Ground position (24:02–28:35)
- Key concepts
  - Shift to grounded entry contexts: bottom structures that allow leg entry without relying on standing tie-ups.
  - The emphasis is on connector positions that preserve inside position and create clean transitions into ashi.
- Position–structure
  - Grounded open guard → inside position → connector → ashi entry.
- Key cues
  - Grounded entries still require the same gates: inside position, connection, knee line.
- Drills
  - Grounded gate ladder: start open guard; establish inside position → connection → knee line; freeze at each gate.
- System tags
  - grounded entries; inside position; gate ladder; connectors

### 7.9 Bottom Single Elevator (28:35–32:57)
- Key concepts
  - Single-elevator (single-leg X style) presented as a grounded platform to elevate, off-balance, and enter leg entanglements.
  - Elevation is used to force posts/steps that create predictable entry lanes.
- Position–structure
  - Single-elevator underhook/leg control → elevate → opponent posts/steps → entry/transition.
- Key cues
  - Elevate to create reaction; don’t elevate “for height” alone.
- Drills
  - Elevator-to-reaction reps: start in single elevator; elevate until a post/step occurs; freeze on reaction; reset.
- System tags
  - single elevator; elevation; reaction creation; grounded entry

### 7.10 Crossed Feet Single Elevator (32:57–36:47)
- Key concepts
  - Crossed-feet variation adds stability and may improve retention when the opponent tries to peel/step out.
  - The crossed-feet configuration changes how force is transmitted into the opponent’s base.
- Position–structure
  - Single elevator base → feet-cross modification → stronger retention/elevation platform.
- Key cues
  - Use crossed feet when the opponent is peeling or widening stance to defeat your base elevator.
- Drills
  - Switch-on-resistance: start standard elevator; partner widens/peels; you switch to crossed-feet elevator and re-elevate; reset.
- System tags
  - crossed-feet elevator; retention; anti-peel adjustment

### 7.11 Inversion (36:47–41:22)
- Key concepts
  - Inversion framed as a penetration tool to get underneath the leg line when direct entry is blocked.
  - Inversion must be tied to a specific control goal (leg capture / ashi entry), not performed as a standalone movement.
- Position–structure
  - Open guard → inversion pathway → leg capture → ashi structure.
- Key cues
  - Invert with purpose: know which leg you are capturing and where your hips need to land.
- Drills
  - Inversion-to-capture reps: partner steps back; you invert to capture a leg and freeze at the capture point; reset.
- System tags
  - inversion; penetration; underhooking legs; entry mechanics

### 7.12 Knee Shield Inversion (41:22–45:39)
- Key concepts
  - Knee shield used as a staging frame to invert safely and create entry pathways without being flattened.
  - The knee shield manages distance while you rotate under the opponent’s leg line.
- Position–structure
  - Knee shield frame → inversion → leg capture → transition.
- Key cues
  - Keep the frame until your hips are already moving under; don’t drop the shield early.
- Drills
  - Shield-to-invert reps: start knee shield; partner pressures in; you maintain shield and invert to capture the leg; reset.
- System tags
  - knee shield; safe inversion; distance frame; entry pathway

### 7.13 Knee Shield to X Guard (45:39–49:43)
- Key concepts
  - X-guard presented as a reliable connector from knee shield: once you create angle, X-guard collects legs and enables elevation/breakdown.
  - X-guard becomes a platform to transition into leg entanglements (straight/cross/reverse as conditions dictate).
- Position–structure
  - Knee shield → angle creation → X-guard leg collection → elevate/breakdown → ashi entry.
- Key cues
  - Use X-guard to collect legs and slow movement before you try to “enter legs” for finishing.
- Drills
  - Shield-to-X reps: establish knee shield; create angle; insert X-guard; hold 3 seconds; reset.
- System tags
  - x-guard; connector; leg collection; elevation platform

### 7.14 Hook Sweep to Reverse X Guard (49:43–54:32)
- Key concepts
  - Hook sweep is used to force a predictable posting response, then reverse X-guard is inserted as the collection platform.
  - Reverse X emphasizes strong elevation and breakdown mechanics that feed leg entanglements.
- Position–structure
  - Hook sweep attempt/entry → opponent posts → reverse X insertion → elevate/breakdown.
- Key cues
  - Use the sweep attempt to create the post; reverse X is inserted on the reaction.
- Drills
  - Sweep-to-insert reps: initiate hook sweep; as partner posts, insert reverse X; elevate to hands-down; freeze; reset.
- System tags
  - hook sweep; reverse x; reaction-based insertion; breakdown

### 7.15 Arm Drag (54:32–58:07)
- Key concepts
  - Arm drag revisited as a grounded connector: create angle from seated/ground and open pathways to legs.
  - The drag is used to shift the opponent’s base and expose the near leg line for capture.
- Position–structure
  - Grounded arm drag → angle → leg capture → entry.
- Key cues
  - Drag past your centerline; aim to create a step or a post you can exploit.
- Drills
  - Ground arm-drag rounds: start seated; achieve arm drag angle; capture a leg and freeze; reset.
- System tags
  - grounded arm drag; angle; leg access; connector

### 7.16 Collor and Heel Entry (58:07–1:02:17)
- Key concepts
  - Collar control combined with heel/ankle connection creates a strong two-point attachment that reduces disengagement.
  - The collar grip disrupts posture while the heel connection establishes leg access, aligning the opponent for entry.
- Position–structure
  - Collar tie/control → heel/ankle connection → entry into ashi (position chosen based on reaction).
- Key cues
  - Two-point attachment: if you lose either collar or heel connection too early, the entry becomes low percentage.
- Drills
  - Collar + heel connection reps: establish collar control and heel/ankle connection; partner tries to disengage; maintain for 5–10 seconds then reset.
- System tags
  - collar control; heel connection; two-point attachment; entry setup

### 7.17 Shoelace Breakdown (1:02:17–1:07:41)
- Key concepts
  - Shoelace/instep control used to break posture and force the opponent’s base to collapse (hands-down or hips-down).
  - Shoelace grip functions as a powerful “handle” that resists withdrawal and helps you steer the leg line into your preferred entanglement.
- Position–structure
  - Shoelace control → off-balance/breakdown → collect and stabilize into ashi or two-leg control.
- Key cues
  - Use shoelace control to create breakdown first; then enter/finish.
- Drills
  - Shoelace-to-breakdown reps: start from initial leg contact; establish shoelace control; force hands-down or hips-down; freeze; reset.
- System tags
  - shoelace control; breakdown; leg steering; entry stabilization
