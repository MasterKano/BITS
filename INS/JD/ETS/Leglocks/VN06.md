# VIEWING NOTES — ETS Leg Locks

## 6.0 Volume 6

### 6.1 Intro (0:00–2:21)
- Key concepts
  - Volume focus: the “third subsystem” in the overall leg lock system — reverse ashi / ushiro senkaku (and why it matters inside the larger leg lock framework).
  - Reverse ashi is presented as both a *position* and a *gateway*: it can lead into straight ashi and cross ashi when the situation demands.
- Position–structure
  - Reverse ashi alignment differs from straight/cross: you are often oriented away from the opponent, which changes how you stabilize and how they can destabilize you.
- Key cues
  - Treat reverse ashi as a control platform first; if you treat it as “just a finish,” you’ll get destabilized.
- Drills
  - Reverse-ashi stability check: partner attempts to come up / push you off-balance; your goal is to keep wedges + control and prevent the get-up.
- System tags
  - reverse ashi; ushiro senkaku; subsystem framing; gateway concept

### 6.2 Central Problems (2:21–4:59)
- Key concepts
  - Central problem cluster emerges in reverse ashi scenarios:
    - strong opponents can destabilize you and “come up” if your structure is loose
    - “tied legs / crossed legs / triangle legs” create a defensive knot (primary leg defended by secondary leg)
  - The defender’s goals: prevent heel exposure and win the race to escape (often via turnout/release behaviors); the attacker’s goals: keep legs tied, stop the get-up, and access the primary leg.
- Position–structure
  - Triangle/crossed legs defense: secondary leg shields the primary leg inside your entanglement.
- Key cues
  - Expect the tied-legs defense; build solutions that *untie the knot* rather than forcing heel hooks through it.
- Drills
  - “Knot problem” reps: start with opponent locking/triangling legs defensively; attacker’s only goal is to create an untie pathway and expose access to the primary leg.
- System tags
  - tied-legs defense; primary/secondary leg roles; destabilization prevention

### 6.3 Untying Legs (4:49–10:18)
- Key concepts
  - Untying is a mechanical problem: you cannot reliably “pull straight back” against a strong leg press/squat structure.
  - Preferred directionality: pull *across your centerline* to bring everything close and put the defender in a mechanically weak position.
  - Common sequence: catch at the toe line / heel-to-toe control → lift across → catch heel → lock the leg tight → untie → then devote attention to primary leg.
- Position–structure
  - Start from reverse ashi with opponent’s legs locked; isolate the secondary leg at toe line to begin the untie.
- Key cues
  - Do not pull into their strongest line (straight back); pull across your centerline.
  - Keep “everything in close” while untangling.
- Drills
  - Centerline-untie reps: partner locks legs defensively; you must (1) catch toe line, (2) pull across centerline, (3) untie, (4) freeze once primary leg is accessible.
- System tags
  - untying legs; centerline pull; toe-line catch; knot-solving

### 6.4 Double Leg Roll (10:18–15:47)
- Key concepts
  - Reverse ashi stability requires pulling the opponent *up toward you* and turning knees into effective wedges; loose extension increases your chance of being pushed off-balance.
  - When the opponent tries to push you off / rise up, you can “lock the second leg” to prevent their get-up and keep them tied to you.
- Position–structure
  - Reverse ashi: draw the opponent’s legs upward; lock structure; turn knees as wedges to resist lateral pushes.
- Key cues
  - Draw them up; don’t let them extend you away.
  - If they push to get up, bind the second leg and deny the rise.
- Drills
  - “Get-up denial” drill: partner starts pushing/trying to come up; you must draw up, wedge with knees, and bind second leg to stop the rise.
- System tags
  - reverse-ashi stabilization; wedge knees; second-leg bind; anti-get-up

### 6.5 Figure Four Toe Hold (15:47–19:26)
- Key concepts
  - Toe holds are positioned as *supporting weapons* in a system primarily built around heel hooks; they are valuable when the legs are tied and the primary leg is shielded.
  - Core idea: apply a figure-four toe hold to the *secondary leg* to create a dilemma while maintaining control of the primary leg inside your ashi.
  - Grip principle emphasis: don’t “grab the short end of the lever”; maximize lever use through correct grip placement.
- Position–structure
  - Primary leg remains controlled in ashi; secondary leg becomes the immediate toe-hold target to force reactions and open access.
- Key cues
  - Toe hold here is a *dilemma tool* (secondary leg) more than a standalone finish chase.
  - Grip placement must be lever-maximizing, not convenience-based.
- Drills
  - “Secondary-leg toe-hold threat” reps: maintain primary-leg ashi control while building a figure-four toe hold threat on the secondary leg; freeze at the dilemma point.
- System tags
  - figure-four toe hold; dilemma creation; secondary-leg attacks; lever-maximizing grip

### 6.6 Dilemma Attack (19:26–26:37)
- Key concepts
  - Dilemma structure: when the primary leg is protected by a tied secondary leg, attack the secondary leg to force a choice between two bad outcomes.
  - The general pattern: control primary leg → threaten secondary leg (toe hold / pressure) → opponent must react → reaction creates access path back to primary leg.
- Position–structure
  - Reverse ashi / tied-legs: secondary leg acts as the “shield”; dilemma attack targets the shield to remove it.
- Key cues
  - Don’t fight the shield head-on; attack it so the defender removes it for you (or pays for keeping it).
- Drills
  - Dilemma flow: start in tied-legs defense; attacker must (1) build secondary-leg threat, (2) read defender’s reaction, (3) transition intent back to primary leg.
- System tags
  - dilemma logic; shield-removal; primary/secondary sequencing

### 6.7 Figure Four Toe Hold Primary Leg (26:37–35:06)
- Key concepts
  - Primary-leg toe hold finishing mechanics emphasized:
    - keep toes down in the hip “pocket” (positional containment)
    - two-hand structure: one hand pushes the toes toward tailbone while the other pulls (push/pull at the ends of the lever)
    - elbow sweeps down toward the end of the lever to create true breaking pressure
- Position–structure
  - Toe hold assembled with foot anchored at the hip; push/pull hands and elbow sweep produce the finish.
- Key cues
  - Containment first (toes in hip pocket), then push/pull, then elbow sweep.
- Drills
  - Assembly reps: toes in hip pocket → establish push hand + pull hand → elbow sweep (controlled finish mechanics, no rushing).
- System tags
  - toe hold mechanics; hip pocket containment; push/pull hands; elbow sweep

### 6.8 Figure Four Toe Hold Non Optimal Conditions (35:06–42:25)
- Key concepts
  - Finishing power is linked to integrated upper-body mechanics:
    - the head must move with the hands; if head stays while hands move, power bleeds
    - elbow follows head; the “unit” moves together (head + elbow + hands)
  - Finish described as coordinated: right pushes, left pulls; elbow and head travel together to complete the break.
- Position–structure
  - Even under imperfect alignment, the finish is salvaged by maintaining the integrated movement unit and lever-end mechanics.
- Key cues
  - Never let head/hands separate; keep the distance constant.
  - Elbow travels with the head; push/pull stays intact.
- Drills
  - “Unit movement” reps: partner gives light resistance; you perform head-hands-elbow integrated motion while maintaining toe containment and push/pull.
- System tags
  - finish integration; head-hands linkage; salvage mechanics; toe-hold under resistance

### 6.9 Transition to Outside Ashi Outside Heel Hook (42:25–48:17)
- Key concepts
  - Reverse ashi framed as a gateway: from reverse you can fall into straight ashi and into cross ashi depending on how you untangle and how the opponent’s legs behave.
  - When untangling becomes difficult, a key solution is to preserve the foot/ankle connection (don’t “release the foot”), then build the pathway into the next ashi.
  - Controlled descent: when dropping to the mat, sequence is controlled (foot initiates, knee follows) to avoid losing the leg.
- Position–structure
  - Untie → release secondary leg attention → biceps covers toes → heel goes in → controlled descent → outside ashi structure is assembled tight.
- Key cues
  - Don’t rush the drop; uncontrolled descent is where the leg escapes.
  - Maintain foot/ankle connection even if you change your hand position.
- Drills
  - “Controlled descent to outside ashi” reps: start from a successful untie; transition into outside ashi with strict foot-then-knee descent; reset on leg loss.
- System tags
  - reverse-to-outside ashi; controlled descent; biceps-over-toes; connection priority

### 6.10 Transition to Cross Ashi Inside Heel Hook (48:17–53:22)
- Key concepts
  - Transition logic to cross ashi:
    - bring the opponent’s legs in close
    - sit underneath and bring the knee inside the opponent’s legs
    - establish cross ashi with laced ankles (high control / difficult for opponent to move)
  - Cross ashi / lace leg platforms allow additional attacks (Achilles locks, lace-leg threats) and improve control quality.
- Position–structure
  - Reverse ashi → sit-through / underhook leg line → right knee enters inside → lace ankles → cross ashi control platform.
- Key cues
  - Knee insertion is the key structural change that turns “reverse gateway” into cross ashi control.
  - Keep ankles laced/tied to slow movement and prevent easy unwinding.
- Drills
  - “Reverse-to-cross lace” reps: preserve ankle connection, sit through, insert knee, lace ankles; partner tries to move/unwind for 5–10 seconds.
- System tags
  - reverse-to-cross ashi; lace legs; knee insertion; high-control platform

### 6.11 Intro (53:22–55:00)
- Key concepts
  - Outside ashi and cross ashi are framed as complementary threats (jab/cross analogy): one forces reactions that expose the other.
  - The opponent can usually defend one by adopting positions that block it, but that defense creates openings for the other.
- Position–structure
  - Alternating threats between outside ashi (heel exposure/breaking positions) and cross ashi (control + alternate exposure routes) creates systemic openings.
- Key cues
  - Don’t be “one-position loyal”; be “two-threat loyal.”
- Drills
  - Two-threat flow: from a stable leg entanglement, force a defensive adjustment that blocks one attack, then switch threats immediately to the other.
- System tags
  - two-threat system; outside vs cross interplay; jab/cross model

### 6.12 Head Position (55:00–1:01:10)
- Key concepts
  - Head movement is used as a decision trigger:
    - if opponent’s head moves away, heel exposure often appears (cover shoelaces, knees to floor, roll-through to outside ashi breaking)
    - if opponent squares head back toward you, heel exposure reduces but ankle/other controls become available (forcing alternate attacks and/or lace platforms)
  - “Knees pointing at the floor” is used as a wedge/control cue while transitioning into the breaking position.
- Position–structure
  - Entry to irimi ashi → read head movement → choose outside ashi roll-through vs alternate control/attack.
- Key cues
  - Make head movement your “if/then” rule for attack selection.
  - When head moves away, commit to the roll-through; when head squares, switch the threat.
- Drills
  - Head-trigger reps: partner alternates head away vs head square; you must choose the correct attack path and freeze in the resulting position.
- System tags
  - head-trigger decision rules; shoelace cover; knees-to-floor wedge; outside-ashi roll-through

### 6.13 Opponent Spins Leg Crossover (1:01:10–1:05:46)
- Key concepts
  - When knee line is slipping, use a “special grip” structure to regain control even as the opponent tries to move away.
  - The grip is framed as structurally powerful: even when it *looks* like the opponent is escaping, the structure can draw them back in.
  - Core idea: recognize the knee escape early and switch to the grip/structure rather than chasing with loose arms.
- Position–structure
  - Losing the knee line → thread grip (upper leg controlled by hand/wrist; lower leg controlled by elbow flare) → draw opponent back.
- Key cues
  - If you feel the knee is about to slip, switch immediately to the recovery grip (don’t “wait until it’s gone”).
- Drills
  - Knee-line slip drill: partner progressively slides knee out; you must transition to the recovery grip before full escape and draw them back into range.
- System tags
  - knee-line recovery; structural grip; draw-back mechanics; early recognition

### 6.14 Static Crossover (1:05:46–1:09:48)
- Key concepts
  - Standing entry example: step/level change + knee catch with locked hands; fingers together for stronger grip.
  - Critical sit-back detail: slide onto your side (not flat on your back) and manage *space* so your opponent’s foot isn’t blocked from the direction you need to slide through.
  - Blocking vs spacing is a binary: wrong block removes your pathway; correct space lets you slide into position cleanly.
- Position–structure
  - Catch behind knee → hand in front of thigh/knee line → slide to hip/side → pull opponent forward into you.
- Key cues
  - Side sit-back (not back sit-back).
  - Create enough space to slide; don’t block your own entry lane with the opponent’s foot.
- Drills
  - Static sit-back reps: partner gives a fixed stance; you practice catch + side sit-back with correct spacing; reset on foot-blocking errors.
- System tags
  - standing sit-back; side-slide; spacing vs blocking; knee-catch grip

### 6.15 Spin Leg To Cross Ashi (1:09:48–1:13:34)
- Key concepts
  - Standing shot sequence: step to centerline using a post hand → penetration step + catch → slide to hip (not back) → legs “fire up” into ashi.
  - Immediate read: opponent head direction determines whether you go to outside attack path or switch toward cross ashi logic.
- Position–structure
  - Centerline step + level change → catch → hip slide → ashi entry → if/then based on head direction.
- Key cues
  - Don’t step “toward the leg you want” in a straight line; prioritize centerline access and proper hip slide.
- Drills
  - Centerline-penetration reps: post hand → step centerline → catch → hip slide; partner varies head direction; you select outside vs cross path.
- System tags
  - centerline entry; hip slide; standing-to-ashi; head-direction decision

### 6.16 Spin Leg To Reverse Ashi (1:13:34–1:16:56)
- Key concepts
  - Common standing-entry errors:
    - falling “in between” opponent’s legs (high risk of getting sprawled/flattened)
    - letting opponent’s body weight land *on top* of you rather than *across* you
  - Goal framing: get head outside the opponent’s leg line; use cross-body hook logic so their weight crosses rather than stacks.
- Position–structure
  - Proper entry line aims the body to the outside channel; cross-body hook contributes to steering and weight distribution.
- Key cues
  - Head outside the leg is a safety + control requirement.
  - Force “across weight,” not “on-top weight.”
- Drills
  - “Head outside” constraint drill: standing entry reps where success is defined by head placement outside leg line and opponent’s weight crossing (not stacking).
- System tags
  - reverse-ashi entry; head-outside safety; cross-body hook; weight-across principle

### 6.17 Rolling Transition From Straight to Cross Ashi (1:16:56–1:22:27)
- Key concepts
  - Transition logic: direction of opponent’s head/turn influences which ashi transition makes most sense; you track and choose accordingly.
  - Cross-body hook appears as a key control feature for creating the transition and drawing opponent into the desired alignment.
  - “Track the head” is presented as a recurring control rule: head direction predicts rotation and informs your switching path.
- Position–structure
  - Straight ashi situation → opponent turns/head shifts → apply cross-body hook → lift/catch/draw → arrive in cross-ashi-aligned control.
- Key cues
  - Don’t switch blindly; switch because head/rotation dictates it.
  - Use hook + draw mechanics to bring opponent into your structure before the roll completes.
- Drills
  - “Head-tracked switch” reps: start in straight ashi; partner turns and moves head; you must track head, apply hook, and transition into cross-ashi control (freeze on arrival).
- System tags
  - rolling transition; straight-to-cross; head tracking; cross-body hook; switch rules
