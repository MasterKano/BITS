===========================
0.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
===========================

- Purpose and overall approach
  - Presents leg locks as a complete positional and submission system rather than isolated techniques.
  - Organises the game from first contact to final break using consistent principles, hierarchies, and decision trees.

- Core positional framework
  - Centers on achieving and maintaining inside position with the legs in all phases (standing, guard, ground, double-seated).
  - Treats control of the opponent’s knee line as the primary positional objective before any serious submission attempt.

- Ashi garami families as control hubs
  - Uses single leg ashi, double leg ashi, cross ashi, irimi ashi, reverse ashi, outside ashi, and ankle lace ashi as main control positions.
  - Defines each family by hip, knee, and foot alignment, with clear roles for primary and secondary legs.

- Grips, torso control, and off-balancing
  - Builds initial control through 2-on-1 gripping, immovable elbow, push–pull dynamics, shin-to-shin, scoop and ankle grips.
  - Integrates upper-body controls (torso ties, hand-over-shoulder, collar-and-elbow style grips) and consistent off-balancing to make entries and entanglements stable.

- Entries, resistance, and the shared spiral
  - Develops structured entries from standing, guard (De La Riva, knee shield, X / reverse X), clinch-style connections, half guard, and double-seated positions.
  - Addresses the shared spiral problem and cycles of inside–outside dominance, using ashi transitions and tempo control to stay ahead of defensive spins and leg crossovers.

- Breaking mechanics and submission chains
  - Emphasises systematic slack removal and wedging before applying breaking force.
  - Builds a submission arsenal around inside and outside heel hooks, figure four toe holds, Achilles-style grips, and double-attack structures that create dilemmas between primary and secondary legs.

- Defence, recovery, and transitions
  - Anticipates common defensive behaviours (turnouts, spins, crossovers, knee-line escapes) and counters them with pre-planned transitions between ashi families.
  - Treats leg untying, knee-line recovery, and re-entanglement as core attacking skills rather than purely defensive reactions.

- Training structure and development
  - Uses connection, penetration, gravity, rolling, and pummelling drills to normalise positional entries and movement within entanglements.
  - Incorporates situational sparring from key entry points and control hubs so decision-making under pressure follows the same system logic as the technical instruction.
  
===============================
1.0 INSTRUCTIONAL VOLUME CONTENT
===============================

- [Volume 1]: Foundational grips, inside position, and torso controls
  Establishes the leg lock game around dominant hand fighting, 2 on 1 gripping, immovable elbow, push–pull dynamics, and torso controls that create consistent entries to inside position against both standing and seated opponents.

- [Volume 2]: Entries to inside position, De La Riva, and base drills
  Builds systematic routes to inside position from standing and guard using De La Riva, top-position leg pummelling, and movement drills, then reinforces knee-line awareness through connection, penetration, gravity, and recovery sequences.

- [Volume 3]: Core ashi configurations and breaking mechanics
  Organises single leg ashi, double leg ashi, and cross ashi around lifting, centreline, and tilting methods, while developing general theory for negating resistance, removing slack, and applying inside and outside heel hooks with maximal control.

- [Volume 4]: Shared spiral and cycles of dominance
  Analyses the shared spiral problem in leg entanglements and uses single and multiple ashi solutions, heel exposure tactics, structured breaking mechanics, and inside–outside cycling to control and dictate the tempo of rotational exchanges.

- [Volume 5]: Straight vs cross ashi and layered dilemmas
  Compares straight and cross ashi through primary and secondary leg roles, double and single leg approaches, ankle lace ashi, and the turnout and release problems, then layers alternative grips, double heel hooks, and elbow-based attacks to build powerful dilemma chains.

- [Volume 6]: Central problems, toe hold system, and spin management
  Addresses central entanglement problems with systematic leg untying, double leg rolls, figure four toe holds in both optimal and compromised conditions, and transitions into outside and cross ashi that maintain control through spins, crossovers, and rolling changes of ashi.

- [Volume 7]: Entries from clinch, guard, and ground positions
  Connects sliding ashi, collar-and-elbow style ties, double and single leg shots, front headlock and arm drag to leg entries, then develops bottom single elevator, knee shield, X and reverse X guard, and collar-and-heel structures as reliable launchpads into entanglements.

- [Volume 8]: Advanced entries, kani basami, and double seated
  Refines sitback, inside–out and outside–in steps, outside step-ins, half guard entries, and kani basami-style attacks, culminating in structured double seated exchanges that treat both athletes’ leg lock attempts as a single integrated decision tree.
  
===========================
2.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
===========================


2.1 INTRODUCTION, BREAKDOWN, AND EXPLICATION
--------------------------------------------

- System vs collection of techniques
  - Leg attacks are organised as a complete positional and submission system, not as isolated moves.
  - Every element (grips, entries, control positions, finishes) is tied into a single, repeatable process from first contact to final break.
  - The system is embedded inside the broader jiu-jitsu game (standing, guard, top, bottom, transitions), not treated as a separate, exotic speciality.

- Role of wedges and immobilisation
  - Wedges are used to immobilise key segments of the opponent’s body so that movement is channelled into joints under attack.
  - Unlike conventional pins that rely heavily on bodyweight, leg entanglements use mechanical wedges (legs, feet, knees, hips) reinforced by posture and grips.
  - Effective use of wedges on both sides of the body is a non-negotiable requirement before high-percentage leg submissions.

- “Six essential skills” framing for heel hooking
  - The system is presented through a finite set of essential skills that collectively cover heel hook application from start to finish.
  - Skills are ordered into a flexible sequence so students can understand where they are in the process at any moment (grips, entries, control, exposure, breaking, follow-through).
  - This creates a mental checklist rather than ad-hoc, single-step attacks.

- General system vs leg lock subsystem
  - The leg lock game is presented as a subsystem within overall jiu-jitsu:
    - Overall jiu-jitsu system: standing, takedowns, guard, passing, pins, back control, upper-body submissions.
    - Leg lock subsystem: specific entries, entanglements, and breaking mechanics that plug into those broader positions.
  - The leg lock subsystem is designed to interact with guard, passing, and back-taking, not replace them.


2.2 MANIFESTATIONS OF LEG LOCK SYSTEM
-------------------------------------

- Positional contexts where the system appears
  - Standing vs standing: entries from step-ins, sitbacks, and level changes into ashi garami.
  - Top vs supine: entries from passing stances, distance control, and leg pummelling.
  - Guard vs kneeling/standing: De La Riva, knee shield, X and reverse X guard leading into entanglements.
  - Double seated: both athletes committed to leg attacks, treating the exchange as a symmetrical battle for inside position and knee line.

- Offensive pathways
  - Direct entries that go straight from neutral positions into ashi garami.
  - Indirect entries that use sweeps, off-balancing, or transitional scrambles to create leg exposure.
  - Re-entries that occur after initial escapes or partial knee-line recoveries, re-capturing the leg as the opponent moves.

- Defensive and counter-offensive manifestations
  - Leg locks as counters to guard passing, takedowns, and scrambles where limbs are extended or isolated.
  - Use of entanglements to convert defensive frames (e.g. against passing pressure) into offensive attacks on exposed legs.
  - Transitions from failed upper-body submissions (e.g. guillotines, front headlocks) into leg entanglements as the opponent pulls free.

- Integration with positional hierarchies
  - Leg-entangled positions are judged not only by submission threat but also by:
    - Control over the opponent’s mobility.
    - Ability to convert to sweeps, stand-ups, or back takes if leg attacks are denied.
  - The system treats leg entanglements as positions with their own hierarchy, not as “desperation” attacks.


2.3 GRIP AND INSIDE POSITION AS SYSTEM FOUNDATION
-------------------------------------------------

- Two foundational elements
  - The system is built around two primary elements:
    - Grip: hand control of the opponent’s leg(s).
    - Inside position: the relative alignment of the attacker’s legs inside the opponent’s legs.
  - Without both in combination, leg attacks are considered structurally weak and easy to escape.

- Grip as the “entry lever”
  - Strong grips (2-on-1, scoop, ankle, shin-to-shin) guide the opponent’s leg into lines of attack.
  - Grip sequences are used to:
    - Break the opponent’s stance or base.
    - Turn the leg in directions that favour heel exposure and knee-line trapping.
  - Preference is for grips that:
    - Control both sides of the limb (e.g. 2-on-1).
    - Keep the attacker’s elbows anchored (“immovable elbow”) so power runs from torso to hands.

- Inside position as the “positional skeleton”
  - Inside positioning of the feet, shins, or knees relative to the opponent’s legs is a recurring theme.
  - Inside position allows:
    - Stronger wedges against the hips and thighs.
    - Easier transitions between ashi families without relinquishing control.
  - Inside position is treated as an ongoing battle, not a one-time achievement: every exchange involves regaining or reinforcing it.

- Interaction of grip and inside position
  - Grip initiates the attack; inside leg position stabilises and extends it.
  - The system assumes that leg attacks without prior or simultaneous inside-position fighting are low-percentage and vulnerable to counters.
  - Training priority is given to sequences that build inside position first, then transition smoothly into entanglements and breaks.


2.4 TORSO CONTROLS AND UPPER–LOWER BODY CONNECTION
--------------------------------------------------

- Need for trunk connection
  - Leg control alone is insufficient; the opponent’s torso must be managed to restrict rotation and escape.
  - The system constantly links leg entanglements to torso controls so that:
    - The hips cannot freely turn to relieve pressure or clear the knee line.
    - The opponent cannot easily posture or stand to disengage.

- Key torso control themes
  - Hand-over-shoulder controls that clamp the upper body and create strong rotational control.
  - Collar-and-elbow style ties that combine head and arm control with leg entanglement threats.
  - Torso clamps from seated or supine positions that lock the opponent in place while the legs work.

- Functional role in the system
  - Torso controls:
    - Anchor wedges around the hips and ribs.
    - Prevent the opponent from spinning out of heel exposure.
    - Funnel escapes into predictable directions where planned transitions (e.g. straight to cross ashi) are ready.
  - They also allow transitions from leg attacks back to upper-body submissions or positional advances if leg submissions are no longer optimal.

- Integration with grips and ashi
  - Ideal configurations layer:
    - Hands on the leg or torso.
    - Legs around the opponent’s hips and thigh.
    - Torso aligned so that bridging and rotation transfer efficiently into breaking mechanics.
  - This creates a single, unified structure rather than separate “upper-body” and “lower-body” games.


2.5 INSIDE POSITION, KNEE LINE, AND LEG-CONTROL HIERARCHY
---------------------------------------------------------

- Distance and demarcation lines
  - The system uses clear demarcation lines (e.g. toe line, knee line) to define safe and dangerous distances.
  - Approaching beyond these lines without structure is treated as a major strategic error:
    - Crossing the toe line or knee line without grips and wedges invites passing and counters.
  - Leg attacks are therefore always paired with explicit distance management.

- Knee line as the central positional objective
  - Control of the opponent’s knee line is treated as the core determinant of effective leg control:
    - If the knee line is trapped inside the entanglement, significant submission and sweeping pressure is available.
    - If the knee line slides free, control is largely lost, even if the feet remain caught.
  - Much of the pummelling and re-entangling work revolves around either:
    - Capturing the knee line initially.
    - Re-capturing it after the opponent’s first escape attempt.

- Leg-control hierarchy
  - Positions are evaluated by:
    - Degree of knee-line isolation.
    - Strength of wedges at the hip, thigh, and ankle.
    - Quality of heel exposure and ability to direct rotational force into the knee.
  - Higher positions in the hierarchy:
    - Trap the hip and knee tightly.
    - Offer multiple submission paths (heel hooks, toe holds, transitions to other ashi).
  - Lower positions:
    - Offer limited control or single-attack options.
    - Are mainly used as transitional routes to stronger entanglements.

- Implications for strategy
  - Entries are only worth pursuing if they are likely to result in knee-line capture.
  - When the knee line starts to clear, priority immediately shifts from finishing to:
    - Re-blocking the hip.
    - Transitioning to another ashi family.
    - Re-sealing wedges around the knee before re-attacking.


2.6 ASHI GARAMI FAMILIES AND SHARED SPIRAL PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------

- Core ashi garami families
  - The system is organised around a small number of recurring leg-entanglement families:
    - Single leg ashi.
    - Double leg ashi.
    - Cross ashi.
    - Irimi ashi.
    - Reverse ashi.
    - Outside ashi.
    - Variants such as ankle lace ashi.
  - Each family is defined by:
    - Which of the attacker’s legs are inside/outside.
    - How the opponent’s hips are pinned.
    - Where the attacker’s hips and shoulders are aligned.

- Subsystems and competence
  - The general theory segments emphasise three major subsystems (e.g. ashi garami, cross ashi, reverse ashi) that must all be mastered to be considered competent.
  - Each subsystem offers:
    - Characteristic entries.
    - Characteristic counters.
    - Characteristic transitions to related families.

- Shared spiral problem
  - In many straight-style entanglements, attacker and defender share the same spiral axis around the leg.
  - This shared spiral permits:
    - Defensive spins that follow the line of attack.
    - Redirections of force that relieve pressure without necessarily freeing the leg.
  - The system acknowledges this as a structural problem that must be deliberately solved.

- Structural responses to the shared spiral
  - Shift from positions where both athletes share the same spiral to positions where:
    - The attacker’s hips and torso are offset from the defender’s.
    - The defender’s ability to freely rotate around the leg is mechanically blocked.
  - Use:
    - Single ashi solutions (changing which leg is entangled and how).
    - Multiple ashi solutions (crossing or stacking legs) to break the shared spiral and isolate one limb more completely.


2.7 CYCLES OF INSIDE–OUTSIDE DOMINANCE
--------------------------------------

- Dynamic nature of inside vs outside
  - Inside position is constantly contested; there is no permanent “win”.
  - As the opponent turns, spins, or crosses their legs, the relative inside/outside status of the attacker’s legs changes.
  - The system responds with predefined cycles that recapture inside position or shift advantage when inside cannot be maintained.

- Leg pummelling as an ongoing process
  - Leg pummelling (both top and bottom) is treated like hand fighting:
    - Continuous exchanges of inside/outside control.
    - Drilled explicitly (pummelling legs from top, hand-post plus leg pummelling, movement inside, gravity drills).
  - These drills embody the cycles of dominance:
    - When the opponent wins outside position, the attacker shifts to another ashi family or re-pummels to regain inside control.

- Inside–outside cycles and entanglement choice
  - Certain ashi families are favoured when inside position is dominant (e.g. configurations where both legs are threaded inside).
  - Others are deployed when the opponent has partially won the outside or is actively spinning:
    - Cross ashi or reverse ashi configurations that turn the opponent’s rotation into an attack.
  - The system treats transitions between these families as planned responses, not improvisations.

- Managing tempo and direction of the spiral
  - Controlling the speed and direction of the shared spiral is a strategic goal:
    - Slow the spiral when the opponent is attempting to spin out.
    - Accelerate or redirect it when using spins to transition to stronger ashi or to follow escapes.
  - This tempo control ensures that each movement of the opponent either:
    - Keeps them in danger.
    - Delivers them into a new, equally dangerous entanglement.


2.8 CENTRAL PROBLEMS, DILEMMAS, AND DECISION TREE
-------------------------------------------------

- Identification of central problems
  - Later volumes explicitly frame a set of “central problems” that must be solved for the leg lock system to function:
    - Untying entangled legs that block attacks.
    - Managing spins and crossovers that threaten control.
    - Attacking when conditions are non-optimal (e.g. imperfect grip or hip alignment).
  - These are not tangential issues; they are treated as structural obstacles that recur in most exchanges.

- Dilemma-based approach
  - The system repeatedly uses dilemmas:
    - If the opponent defends the primary leg, the secondary leg becomes exposed.
    - If they protect the heel, they expose the toe or Achilles.
    - If they try to free the knee line, they open transitions to new entanglements.
  - Example themes include:
    - Heel hook vs toe hold dilemmas.
    - Heel hook vs Achilles grip.
    - Attacking crossed legs, where freeing one leg exposes the other.

- Decision tree structure
  - The leg lock process is conceptualised as a decision tree:
    - Start: stance, grips, and first entries.
    - Mid-branches: which ashi family is obtained, what defensive reaction appears (turnout, spin, crossover, stand-up).
    - End branches: finish with appropriate breaking mechanics or transition to another dominant position (mount, back, top position) if submission is no longer optimal.
  - At each node, there is a preferred response based on:
    - Current entanglement.
    - State of the knee line.
    - Direction of the opponent’s movement.

- Follow-through and continuity
  - “Follow-through” is emphasised: a break attempt that fails should naturally lead into:
    - A second submission on the same leg.
    - A transition to the other leg.
    - A positional upgrade (e.g. sweeping into top while maintaining entanglement).
  - The system discourages single, isolated attempts and favours continuous chains that pressure the opponent until a break or dominant position is achieved.

- Integration with defensive responsibilities
  - Even while attacking, the system prescribes constant monitoring of:
    - Counter-leg locks.
    - Back takes and upper-body counters.
    - Standing escapes.
  - Defensive awareness is built into the decision tree so that the attacker’s responses do not open higher-value counters for the opponent.
  
=====================
3.0 CORE CONCEPTS
=====================


3.1 GRIP AND INSIDE POSITION
----------------------------

- Grip as first layer of control
  - Leg attacks are built on initial hand control of the opponent’s leg(s) before any entanglement is attempted.
  - Preferred grips include:
    - Two-on-one grips on the ankle or shin.
    - Scoop grips under the heel or ankle.
    - Direct ankle grips that fix the foot as the leg is redirected.
  - Grips are used to:
    - Break stance or base.
    - Turn the leg into weak directions.
    - Draw the leg into the attacker’s hip line for entanglement.

- Inside position of the legs
  - “Inside position” means the attacker’s legs are threaded to the inside of the opponent’s legs rather than left outside.
  - Inside position enables:
    - Stronger wedges against hips and thighs.
    - Easier transitions between ashi garami families without giving space.
    - Direct access to the opponent’s centerline and knee line.
  - Inside position is treated as a constant fight:
    - Entries, pummelling, and re-entries all aim to either gain or regain inside leg position.

- Grip + inside position as non-negotiable pair
  - Grip without inside position yields weak, easily-kicked-off attacks.
  - Inside position without reliable grips makes it difficult to direct or expose the leg.
  - The system assumes high-percentage leg attacks only occur when both are present:
    - Strong, connected grips.
    - Stable, inside-position leg configuration.


3.2 2 ON 1 GRIPPING AND IMMOVABLE ELBOW
---------------------------------------

- Two-on-one gripping
  - Uses both hands to control a single limb segment (e.g. ankle, shin, wrist) instead of one hand per limb.
  - Key aims:
    - Overwhelm the strength of the opponent’s single grip or posting hand.
    - Fix the limb so the legs can move around it rather than chasing it in space.
  - Two-on-one arrangements are used both on the upper and lower body:
    - On the leg, they control the ankle/shin for entries and off-balancing.
    - On the arm, they break posture and prevent effective posting during leg entries.

- Immovable elbow concept
  - Strength in the two-on-one is created by bringing the elbow to the attacker’s own hip or ribcage.
  - When the elbow is tight to the body:
    - The entire torso supports the grip.
    - Attempts to pull or push the limb move the attacker’s body rather than separating the grip.
  - Practical rule:
    - Once the grip is established, the arm shortens and the elbow “sticks” to the hip to become structurally strong.

- Integration into entries
  - Two-on-one with immovable elbow is used to:
    - Pull the opponent into off-balance.
    - Turn their foot to expose the heel side.
    - Hold the leg in place long enough for the attacker’s hips and legs to enter into ashi configurations.


3.3 PUSH–PULL DYNAMIC
----------------------

- Principle of opposing forces
  - Effective control often requires simultaneous pushing with one connection and pulling with another.
  - Typical pattern:
    - Hands pull the leg or torso towards the attacker.
    - Hips or feet push into the opponent to disrupt stance or alignment.

- Application to leg entries
  - Push–pull is used to:
    - Make the opponent step, widen, or narrow their stance on command.
    - Create moments where one leg is light or extended and therefore vulnerable.
  - Example behaviours:
    - Pulling the foot while pushing the opponent’s hip to force a rotation.
    - Pushing the knee line away while pulling the foot across the centerline.

- Ongoing adjustment
  - Push–pull is continuously adjusted as the opponent reacts:
    - If they pull the leg back, the attacker follows with the hips and keeps the pull.
    - If they drive forward, the attacker posts and pushes to re-create distance and angle.


3.4 TORSO CONTROLS AND HAND OVER SHOULDERS
------------------------------------------

- Need to connect leg attacks to upper-body control
  - Leg entanglements become fragile if the opponent’s upper body is free to rotate or posture.
  - Torso control stabilises the entire structure:
    - Limits spinning and turning to escape the heel hook line.
    - Prevents the opponent from standing or posting easily.

- Hand-over-shoulder control
  - A signature torso control where the attacker’s arm comes over the opponent’s shoulder and clamps behind the back or lat.
  - Functions:
    - Glues the opponent’s torso to the attacker’s chest or side.
    - Turns their upper body into an additional wedge against their own hip rotation.
  - Often combined with leg entanglements:
    - Lower body ties up the legs.
    - Hand-over-shoulder blocks upper-body turns.

- General torso control principles
  - Connection points may include:
    - Over-hooks, under-hooks, collar-and-elbow style grips, or head clamps.
  - Aim is consistent:
    - Wherever the opponent’s hips go, their shoulders are dragged with them, so they cannot freely spin out of danger.


3.5 KNEE AND KNEE LINE
----------------------

- Demarcation and distance
  - The system recognises clear distance markers:
    - Toe line.
    - Knee line.
    - Deeper penetration beyond the hip.
  - Approaching these lines without structure is treated as strategically unsound; with structure, they guide when to enter.

- Knee vs knee line
  - “Knee” refers to the joint itself.
  - “Knee line” is a conceptual line across the leg at knee level, used to judge whether the leg is captured inside the entanglement.
  - Critical distinction:
    - A foot can be caught without the knee line being controlled; this is considered low-value control.

- Knee line as control threshold
  - Effective leg control requires the opponent’s knee line to be trapped inside the attacker’s hip and leg configuration.
  - If the opponent’s knee line slips past the attacker’s hips or thighs:
    - Control is essentially lost.
    - Finishing attempts are drastically weakened.
  - Much of the system’s pummelling, re-entangling, and recovery work is oriented around:
    - Capturing the knee line.
    - Preventing it from escaping.
    - Re-capturing it when the opponent partially frees it.


3.6 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY LEG
-----------------------------

- Role differentiation
  - In dual-leg control situations, one leg is treated as the primary target and the other as the secondary leg.
  - Primary leg:
    - The limb currently under direct submission threat or nearest to a high-percentage finishing configuration.
  - Secondary leg:
    - The other limb, used to enhance control, disrupt base, or serve as a backup submission target.

- Strategic use of secondary leg
  - The secondary leg is often:
    - Laced or pinned to restrict movement.
    - Used to break the opponent’s base or prevent standing.
    - Threatened with its own heel hook or toe hold to create dilemmas.

- Switching roles
  - As the opponent defends, the roles of primary and secondary leg can flip:
    - Defending the primary leg may expose the secondary leg to direct attack.
    - The system continually monitors which leg is easiest to break and is ready to switch focus.


3.7 DOUBLE AND SINGLE LEG APPROACHES
------------------------------------

- Double-leg style approaches
  - Entries that square up to both of the opponent’s legs, similar in feel to double-leg takedown mechanics.
  - Common aims:
    - Trap both legs together (e.g. ankle lace ashi).
    - Collapse the opponent’s base by controlling both knees or ankles.

- Single-leg style approaches
  - Entries that focus initially on isolating one leg:
    - Single-leg style grips.
    - Sliding ashi entries.
    - Elevators and hook sweeps to expose a single limb.
  - These approaches often lead first into single leg ashi or similar configurations.

- Functional contrast
  - Double-leg approaches:
    - Greater initial control of base but sometimes slower to a clean submission route.
  - Single-leg approaches:
    - Faster access to ashi but may give the opponent more initial mobility.
  - The system includes both, choosing according to stance, distance, and available grips.


3.8 TURNOUT PROBLEM
-------------------

- Nature of the problem
  - When the opponent “turns out,” they rotate their body to face away or change the direction of their hips relative to the entanglement.
  - Turnout can:
    - Remove direct heel exposure.
    - Start the process of clearing the knee line or freeing the hip.

- Structural consequences
  - If turnout is not anticipated:
    - The attacker may lose the ability to direct rotational force into the knee joint.
    - The opponent may come up to top or begin to exit the entanglement entirely.

- System response
  - Turnout is treated as a predictable defensive behaviour:
    - Attacking configurations and grip choices are selected to either:
      - Prevent effective turnout.
      - Convert turnout into transitions (e.g. from one ashi family to another, or into toe hold / secondary leg attacks).
  - Decision-making around turnout is embedded in the overall decision tree.


3.9 RELEASE PROBLEM AND MANAGING THE RELEASE
--------------------------------------------

- Release problem definition
  - Even when strong control is initially obtained, opponents will fight to “release” key components of the entanglement:
    - Peeling grips.
    - Removing wedges.
    - Uncrossing or slipping legs out of control.

- Typical release behaviours
  - Peeling the attacker’s feet apart.
  - Pushing or prying at knees to open entanglements.
  - Sliding the hip away from the attacker’s belt line.

- Management strategies
  - Anticipate which part of the structure the opponent is most likely to attack (e.g. crossed feet, locked knees, specific grip).
  - As they begin to release that element:
    - Tighten or redirect the structure.
    - Switch to alternative grips (e.g. alternative Achilles grip).
    - Transition to another entanglement where their defensive hand placement becomes a liability.
  - The system treats managing the release as an integral skill, not a last-second reaction.


3.10 SHARED SPIRAL PROBLEM AND CONTROLLING SHARED SPIRAL
--------------------------------------------------------

- Shared spiral problem
  - In many straight-style leg entanglements, attacker and defender share a common rotational axis around the trapped leg.
  - This shared axis allows:
    - Defenders to roll with the applied force.
    - Rotations that diffuse pressure rather than increase it.

- Practical risks
  - When attacker and defender spin together:
    - The attacker’s hips and shoulders may be dragged into positions where the heel is no longer exposed.
    - The defender can convert spins into escapes or positional improvements.

- Controlling the spiral
  - The system deliberately seeks to:
    - Break the shared spiral by altering hip alignment and leg configuration (e.g. shifting to cross or reverse ashi, using multiple ashi structures).
    - Control the speed and range of rotational movement.
  - Core idea:
    - The attacker dictates when and how rotation occurs; the defender’s spins are either blocked or converted into transitions.


3.11 CYCLES OF INSIDE–OUTSIDE DOMINANCE
---------------------------------------

- Constant battle for leg-inside position
  - Inside vs outside leg position changes dynamically as both athletes move.
  - No entanglement is considered fixed; every exchange includes attempts to change inside/outside status.

- Cycles as planned sequences
  - As the opponent wins outside position:
    - The system prescribes pummelling sequences and transitions to recapture inside control.
  - As the attacker wins inside position:
    - The system moves quickly into ashi families that capitalise on this dominance.

- Training emphasis
  - Drills such as:
    - Pummelling legs from top.
    - Movement-inside drills.
    - Gravity drills and rolling drills.
  - These encode the habit of:
    - Continuously tracking inside/outside leg status.
    - Responding immediately with the appropriate cycle or transition.


3.12 CENTRAL PROBLEMS AND DILEMMA ATTACK
----------------------------------------

- Central problems
  - The system isolates recurring difficulties that must be solved consistently:
    - Untying entangled legs that block attacks.
    - Managing spins and crossovers.
    - Finishing from non-optimal grips or hip positions.

- Dilemma-based attacking
  - Attacks are structured so that any reasonable defence creates new problems:
    - Protecting one leg exposes the other.
    - Protecting the heel exposes the toe or Achilles.
    - Defending the knee line opens up transitions to other ashi families.
  - “Dilemma attack” refers to sequences where:
    - Every defensive choice keeps the opponent inside the attacking system and moves them closer to submission or positional loss.

- Integration with the decision tree
  - Central problems and dilemmas are embedded into branching choices:
    - At each defensive reaction, there is a preferred attacking answer that keeps the initiative and closes options for the opponent.


3.13 NEGATING RESISTANCE AND SLACK REMOVAL
------------------------------------------

- Understanding resistance
  - Resistance arises when:
    - The opponent’s joints are not fully aligned for breaking.
    - There is slack in the system between grip, wedges, and joint.
    - The opponent’s body is free to move in the direction of applied force.

- Slack removal
  - Before applying maximal force, the system insists on:
    - Tightening all wedges around hip, thigh, and ankle.
    - Adjusting grip depth and angle.
    - Aligning the attacker’s hips and torso so that force goes directly into the target joint.
  - Only after slack is removed does a full breaking motion occur.

- Negating resistance as a step, not an afterthought
  - Negating resistance is a deliberate phase in the attack, not a reactive scramble after a failed break.
  - This phase may include:
    - Small hip slides.
    - Re-angling of the upper body.
    - Grip switches or secondary control additions before re-committing to the finish.


3.14 FOLLOW-THROUGH AND BREAKING CONTINUITY
-------------------------------------------

- Follow-through principle
  - A breaking attempt is never a single, isolated action.
  - If the opponent survives the initial attempt:
    - The attack flows directly into a second or third breaking action.
    - Or into a transition to a new entanglement with immediate threats.

- Continuity of pressure
  - The system minimises “dead time” after a failed attempt:
    - While the opponent is reacting to the first attack, the next phase is already underway.
    - This creates the sense of continuous danger rather than isolated threats.

- Structural outcomes
  - Follow-through paths typically lead to:
    - Completed submission on either leg.
    - Sweep or reversal into top position.
    - Transition to dominant upper-body positions (e.g. back, mount) if leg submissions become less favourable.


3.15 HEAD POSITION AND LEG CROSSOVERS
-------------------------------------

- Importance of head position
  - Head placement is used to:
    - Maintain balance during rolling transitions.
    - Block certain turning escapes.
    - Direct the line of force in heel hooks and toe holds.
  - Poor head position can:
    - Expose the attacker to sweeps.
    - Allow the opponent to sit up or rotate to safety.

- Opponent spins and leg crossovers
  - Common defensive behaviours:
    - Dynamic crossover: opponent rapidly crosses legs while spinning.
    - Static crossover: opponent locks legs in a crossed configuration to block entanglements.
  - These behaviours can:
    - Shield the primary leg.
    - Create frames that prevent the attacker from closing wedges.

- System responses
  - Prescribed transitions include:
    - Spinning the leg into cross ashi or reverse ashi as the opponent turns.
    - Using figure-four controls or toe holds that specifically target crossed legs.
  - Head and torso follow the leg appropriately:
    - Never leaving the head behind where it can be dragged off-line or used for sweeps.


3.16 INDEPENDENT THINKING AND SYSTEM-LEVEL REASONING
----------------------------------------------------

- Beyond rote technique lists
  - The system repeatedly emphasises:
    - Understanding underlying concepts (inside position, wedges, knee line, spirals) over memorising sequences.
  - Students are pushed to:
    - Diagnose why a given attack is failing.
    - Identify which element (grip, wedge, knee line, spiral control) is missing.

- Applying core concepts under pressure
  - Independent thinking is expressed by:
    - Adjusting entries and transitions in live rounds while staying inside system rules.
    - Choosing which ashi family to use based on actual reactions, not predetermined preference.

- Long-term development
  - The goal is to create practitioners who:
    - Can reconstruct solutions to new leg lock problems by reference to core concepts.
    - Are not dependent on seeing every possible variation demonstrated in advance.
    
    
=====================
4.0 TECHNIQUE LIBRARY
=====================


4.1 Single leg ashi
-------------------

- Positional structure
  - One of the attacker’s legs threads to the inside of the opponent’s leg; the other leg wraps or wedges around the same leg from outside.
  - Hips are set close to the opponent’s hip line so that the opponent’s knee line is captured between the attacker’s thighs.
  - Feet are used as active wedges, not passive hooks: one foot blocks the hip, the other blocks the far thigh or butt to prevent turning.

- Entry themes
  - Commonly obtained from guard-style positions where the attacker:
    - Uses grips to pull the opponent’s leg across the centerline.
    - Scoots under the hip while threading an inside leg.
  - Often follows from shin-to-shin or sliding-style entries where the attacker’s shin already has inside access to the opponent’s leg.

- Control priorities
  - Keep the opponent’s knee line inside the frame of the attacker’s hips; if the knee line slips past, the position is treated as lost.
  - Maintain inside leg position; if the opponent kicks the inside leg free, immediate re-pummelling or transition to another ashi family is required.
  - Use grips (2-on-1, ankle or scoop grips) to fix the foot while the hips adjust angle.

- Attacking options
  - Primary attack routes:
    - Inside heel hook if the heel is exposed on the inside.
    - Outside heel hook when the heel is available on the outside of the leg.
  - Secondary routes include:
    - Transitioning to double leg ashi or cross ashi when the opponent rotates or triangles their legs.
    - Using off-balancing to sweep and come on top while maintaining entanglement.

- Common defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent tries to rotate their knee line out of the entanglement:
    - Follow the rotation with the hips, continuing to trap the knee line.
    - Or cut the angle and transition to cross ashi.
  - Opponent stands:
    - Tighten wedges around hip and knee.
    - Use kuzushi (off-balancing) to knock them back to the mat before committing to a full break.


4.2 Double leg ashi
-------------------

- Positional structure
  - Both of the opponent’s legs are trapped together between or around the attacker’s legs.
  - The attacker usually has both feet inside, or one in–one out, but with strong control over both knees or ankles.
  - Hips are directly under or in front of the opponent’s hips, making their base narrow and unstable.

- Entry themes
  - Built from double-leg style approaches in which:
    - The attacker steps or sits in between the opponent’s legs.
    - Grips collect both ankles or both knees and pull them together.
  - Frequently connected to ankle lace ashi, where both ankles are bound and lifted.

- Control priorities
  - Bind the opponent’s knees together so they cannot step out independently.
  - Keep at least one of the attacker’s legs threaded to the inside, so losing one control still leaves inside position on at least one leg.
  - Maintain a strong line of pull through the ankles or knees, drawing them towards the attacker’s chest.

- Attacking options
  - Heel hooks on either leg when the opponent’s feet are separated or crossed.
  - Toe holds and Achilles-style grips when the ankles are close together and heel exposure is limited.
  - Sweeping by tipping the opponent backwards or forwards while their base is compromised.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent tries to separate their legs:
    - Follow the separation and convert to single leg ashi or cross ashi on the leg that moves furthest.
  - Opponent sits or rolls:
    - Maintain the double-leg bind and follow into rolling entries for heel hooks, or transition to outside ashi if they turn.


4.3 Cross ashi
--------------

- Positional structure
  - The opponent’s leg is crossed over the attacker’s torso; the attacker’s legs form a figure-four around the opponent’s trapped thigh and hip.
  - One of the attacker’s legs usually threads deep under the opponent’s thigh; the other locks over it, pinching the knees together.
  - The opponent’s knee line is pinned firmly across the attacker’s belt line.

- Entry themes
  - Commonly reached from single leg ashi when:
    - The opponent turns away and crosses their legs defensively.
    - The attacker backsteps or hip-switches to place the opponent’s knee across the stomach line.
  - Also arises from standing or guard entries where the leg is actively pulled across the body before entanglement.

- Control priorities
  - Clamp the opponent’s knee between the attacker’s thighs with a strong figure-four.
  - Angle the hips so that the opponent’s heel is pointing directly into a breaking direction (inside or outside).
  - Prevent the opponent’s hips from sliding past the attacker’s hips; if the knee line drifts above or below, adjustment is required.

- Attacking options
  - Very strong inside heel hook configuration when the heel is turned inwards.
  - Outside heel hook when the entanglement is angled differently and the heel emerges on the outside.
  - Secondary attacks include toe holds, straight ankle locks, or transitions to reverse ashi if the opponent spins.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent tries to spin with the line of the heel hook:
    - Follow the spin and maintain heel control, or deliberately convert to reverse ashi as they rotate.
  - Opponent triangles or crosses legs:
    - Use figure-four toe hold ideas on the secondary leg.
    - Untie the legs as a prelude to returning to a clean cross ashi configuration.


4.4 Irimi ashi
--------------

- Positional structure
  - A penetrating ashi configuration where the attacker’s leg enters deeply between the opponent’s legs.
  - Hips are often more square to the opponent compared with cross ashi, emphasising forward penetration.
  - The attacker’s feet create wedges inside and behind the opponent’s knees or thighs.

- Entry themes
  - Often follows from leg pummelling from top:
    - The attacker steps their leg between the opponent’s legs and drops their weight through the entanglement.
  - From guard, arises when:
    - The attacker underhooks the leg and drives the hips directly underneath or through the opponent’s center.

- Control priorities
  - Maintain deep hip penetration so the opponent’s knee line cannot retract.
  - Keep the attacking leg threaded firmly inside; if the opponent pushes the leg out, re-pummelling is required.
  - Use grips to pull the opponent’s leg into the entanglement rather than reaching the legs out to chase it.

- Attacking options
  - Heel hooks as the primary finishing route, once the heel is isolated and the knee line is secured.
  - Transitions into other ashi families (cross, reverse, outside) when the opponent turns or tries to backstep out.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent tries to sprawl or drive hips backwards:
    - Maintain attachment via grips and move with the hips rather than pulling the leg from distance.
  - Opponent brings knees together:
    - Feed the legs into double leg ashi or ankle lace-style positions.


4.5 Reverse ashi
----------------

- Positional structure
  - The attacker faces away from the opponent rather than towards them.
  - One of the attacker’s legs is threaded across or under the opponent’s thigh; the other leg reinforces from the outside.
  - The opponent’s knee is rotated in the opposite direction to standard ashi, creating a different breaking line.

- Entry themes
  - Often reached by:
    - Following the opponent’s spin from cross ashi or single leg ashi until the attacker’s torso is turned away.
    - Deliberately rotating through to reverse ashi when the opponent insists on rolling with heel hook pressure.
  - May also arise when the opponent over-rotates in defence and the attacker stays attached to the leg.

- Control priorities
  - Keep the opponent’s knee wedged between the attacker’s thighs while facing away.
  - Ensure that hip-to-knee alignment of the opponent remains compromised; hips should not be free to square up behind the attacker.
  - Maintain control of the foot and heel so that the direction of rotation remains under the attacker’s control.

- Attacking options
  - Powerful heel hook mechanics using the reverse alignment:
    - Emphasis on controlling the line of rotation so it feeds directly into the knee.
  - Secondary options include:
    - Transition back to cross or standard ashi if the opponent’s hips re-square.
    - Switching sides on the leg if the opponent’s secondary leg becomes more accessible.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent continues to spin:
    - The attacker either follows and maintains reverse ashi, or converts the spin into transitions back into cross ashi or into a top position.
  - Opponent tries to sit up behind the attacker:
    - Use torso connection, hip height, and leg wedges to stop them from climbing to the back while still keeping the leg trapped.


4.6 Outside ashi
----------------

- Positional structure
  - The attacker’s legs are mostly on the outside of the opponent’s trapped leg, with limited or no inside threading.
  - Hips often face more towards the opponent’s outside rather than squarely in front.
  - Control relies heavily on foot placement behind the opponent’s knee, hip, or butt.

- Entry themes
  - Frequently obtained from:
    - Standing sitback-style entries where the attacker steps outside and sits to the outside hip.
    - Situations where inside position was lost or traded for speed of entry, resulting in outside-dominant control.

- Control priorities
  - Maintain strong foot and knee wedges behind the opponent’s knee and hip to limit rotation.
  - Use grips to pull the opponent’s foot towards the attacker’s torso, compressing the leg.
  - Be aware that control is generally weaker than inside-based ashi; quick transitions to inside-dominant configurations are valued.

- Attacking options
  - Outside heel hook is the signature attack:
    - Heel exposure is typically easier, but knee-line control is more fragile.
  - Toe holds and ankle locks can supplement when heel exposure is partial.
  - Frequently used as an intermediate stage en route to cross or inside ashi.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent turns inwards to clear the heel:
    - Use the turn to re-thread the legs inside and establish a stronger ashi family.
  - Opponent stands and tries to kick free:
    - Maintain attachment through grips and attempt to off-balance them back to the mat before escalating pressure.


4.7 Ankle lace ashi (double leg approach)
-----------------------------------------

- Positional structure
  - Both of the opponent’s ankles are bound together using the attacker’s arms, legs, or a combination.
  - The attacker’s hips are close to the opponent’s feet, lifting or pulling them off the mat.
  - Often overlaps structurally with double leg ashi but with a stronger emphasis on the ankles rather than thighs.

- Entry themes
  - Built from double-leg style entries where:
    - The attacker penetrates between the legs and collects both ankles.
    - The opponent’s legs are drawn together and elevated.
  - May follow failed passing attempts where both legs are already close together.

- Control priorities
  - Keep the opponent’s heels pinned close to the attacker’s hips or ribs.
  - Use leg and hip position to prevent the opponent from freely bending their knees or standing.
  - Maintain pressure so the opponent cannot separate their feet or re-establish a stable base.

- Attacking options
  - Straight ankle locks and toe holds when the ankles are tightly controlled.
  - Heel hooks on one or both legs when the heels can be separated and exposed.
  - Sweeps or stand-ups when the opponent’s base is broken and they are forced to sit or fall.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent tries to kick one leg free:
    - Follow the escaping leg into single leg ashi or cross ashi.
  - Opponent sits up:
    - Knock them backwards with a push–pull dynamic while maintaining ankle lace control and progressing to stronger entanglements.


4.8 Shin-to-shin and scoop gripping
-----------------------------------

- Shin-to-shin connection
  - Attacker places their shin directly against the opponent’s shin, typically from seated or guard positions.
  - The attacker’s outside foot hooks behind the opponent’s calf or ankle to control distance.
  - This connection serves as a high-control platform for sweeping or entering into ashi.

- Scoop gripping
  - The attacker threads a hand under the opponent’s ankle or heel and “scoops” it up into the hip line.
  - Scoop grip:
    - Elevates the foot.
    - Turns the toes and heel into favourable directions.
    - Keeps the leg light and manipulable.

- Combined application
  - Shin-to-shin fixes the lower leg in place; scoop grip lifts and redirects it.
  - Together, they:
    - Off-balance the opponent.
    - Line the leg up for immediate entries into single leg ashi, cross ashi, or other entanglements.
  - Emphasis is on:
    - Getting close – no long-range reaching.
    - Lifting the leg into the attacker’s body rather than chasing it with extended arms.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent retracts the leg:
    - Follow with the hips, maintaining shin contact and scoop grip.
  - Opponent steps over or back:
    - Use the movement to transition into knee shield, X guard, or different entanglement entries.


4.9 Sliding ashi and sitback mechanics
--------------------------------------

- Sliding ashi
  - The attacker “slides” their hips underneath or along the opponent’s leg rather than simply stepping into place.
  - The sliding motion:
    - Maintains continuous contact.
    - Minimises space for the opponent to retract.
    - Positions the attacker’s hips close to the opponent’s knee line at the moment of entanglement.

- Sitback mechanics
  - From standing or semi-standing positions, the attacker:
    - Controls the opponent’s leg with grips.
    - Drops or “sits back” to the mat while keeping the leg trapped.
  - Proper sitback:
    - Keeps the attacker’s hips close to the opponent’s hips.
    - Avoids falling away and leaving gaps that the opponent can exploit to free the knee.

- Integration into ashi entries
  - Sliding and sitback mechanics are combined:
    - Slide in to connect hips to the leg.
    - Sit back to lock the leg into a chosen ashi family.
  - Key principle:
    - Hips move first; the fall to the mat is a consequence of strong hip connection, not a desperate drop.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent pulls leg away as the attacker starts to sit:
    - The attacker continues sliding forward, ensuring the hip–knee distance remains short.
  - Opponent tries to jump clear:
    - Grips and hip line are used to hold the leg while the sitback finishes, converting the jump into an off-balance.


4.10 Outside heel hook
----------------------

- Heel exposure
  - The outside heel hook targets the heel on the outside of the opponent’s leg.
  - Heel exposure is created by:
    - Turning the opponent’s toes inward.
    - Fixing the knee line so the heel protrudes on the outside edge of the leg.

- Grip mechanics
  - The attacker clamps the heel with the forearm and wrist line, locking it in a pocket between forearm and ribs or torso.
  - Tight elbow positioning ensures:
    - The heel cannot slip.
    - Rotational force transfers effectively into the knee.

- Body positioning
  - Hips are aligned so that the direction of rotation feeds into the outside of the opponent’s knee.
  - The attacker’s legs wedge the opponent’s hip and thigh to stop the knee from turning freely.
  - Upper and lower body rotate together in a tight arc rather than as separate units.

- Breaking action
  - Once slack is removed, the attacker:
    - Rotates their torso.
    - Uses the hips as the engine for twisting force.
  - Emphasis is on gradual increase of pressure rather than sudden jerk, especially in training.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent attempts to roll with the heel hook:
    - Attacker follows and maintains heel control, or converts the rotation into reverse ashi.
  - Opponent tries to straighten the leg:
    - Tighten wedges, slide hips closer, and re-capture the knee line before re-applying rotational force.


4.11 Inside heel hook
---------------------

- Heel exposure
  - The inside heel hook targets the heel on the inside of the opponent’s leg.
  - Exposure is achieved by:
    - Turning the toes outward.
    - Pinning the knee so that any outward rotation stresses the medial structures.

- Grip mechanics
  - Heel is once again captured in a tight pocket formed by the attacker’s forearm and torso.
  - Gripping focuses on:
    - Anchoring the heel.
    - Preventing the foot from slipping or “spiralling” out of the hold.

- Body positioning
  - Entanglements such as cross ashi often provide ideal geometry for inside heel hooks.
  - Hips and torso are rotated so that:
    - Twisting motion goes straight into the inside of the knee.
    - The opponent cannot freely follow the rotation with their hip.

- Breaking action
  - Slack removal steps precede the final twist:
    - Tighten wedges at hip and thigh.
    - Adjust the angle so the line of force is clean.
  - Breaking is applied by coordinated torso and hip rotation, not isolated arm twisting.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent rolls in the direction of the applied force:
    - Attacker either follows while keeping heel control, or transitions to a different ashi when the geometry becomes unfavourable.
  - Opponent triangles or crosses legs:
    - Use toe hold options on the secondary leg or untie the legs via prescribed untying mechanics.


4.12 Double heel hook attack
----------------------------

- Concept
  - Both of the opponent’s heels are threatened simultaneously.
  - Often arises when:
    - The attacker controls both legs (e.g. double leg ashi or ankle lace).
    - Or when a transition from one leg exposes the second leg in immediate sequence.

- Control structure
  - Knees are clamped and hips are kept close so each leg is isolated but still part of a unified structure.
  - The attacker’s arms:
    - Control one or both heels.
    - Or switch rapidly between them according to defensive reactions.

- Dilemma function
  - Attacking two heels at once forces the opponent to:
    - Split their defensive attention.
    - Commit both hands to one heel, exposing the other.
  - The system treats this as a classic dilemma:
    - Any effective defence of one heel worsens the situation for the other leg.

- Safety and training emphasis
  - Double heel hook scenarios carry significant risk; the instructional stresses:
    - Controlled application.
    - Clear communication between training partners.
    - Early tapping behaviour.


4.13 Figure four toe hold – primary leg
---------------------------------------

- Tactical context
  - Used when the primary leg (the leg inside the main entanglement) is defended by the secondary leg.
  - Especially relevant when the opponent’s secondary leg is tying or crossing over the primary leg to block heel exposure.

- Control structure
  - Attacker maintains the main ashi entanglement on the primary leg.
  - The secondary leg is then isolated for attack:
    - Hips and wedges keep the primary leg trapped.
    - Hands form a figure-four around the secondary foot.

- Grip specifics
  - Emphasis on lever quality:
    - Small pinky knuckle is placed against the first joint of the opponent’s little toe.
    - The grip is taken as far from the ankle as practical to maximise lever length.
  - The figure-four position uses:
    - One hand wrapping the foot.
    - The other reinforcing the wrist and creating strong rotational torque at the toes.

- Breaking action
  - Rotational pressure is applied through the toes, leveraging into the ankle and lower leg.
  - The primary leg remains immobilised in the main entanglement, limiting the opponent’s ability to roll or turn with the toe hold.

- Strategic effect
  - Forces a dilemma:
    - If the opponent uses the secondary leg to shield the primary leg, the toe hold becomes available.
    - If they uncross or move the secondary leg to defend the toe hold, the primary leg becomes more vulnerable to heel hooks.


4.14 Figure four toe hold – non optimal conditions
--------------------------------------------------

- Non-optimal conditions
  - Situations where:
    - The opponent’s legs are awkwardly tied.
    - The angle of the foot is less than ideal.
    - The attacker’s hip position is not perfect.
  - The instructional addresses how to still apply effective toe holds without textbook geometry.

- Adjustments
  - Changing hip angle:
    - Rotate the hips to bring the line of force closer to the joint being attacked.
  - Adjusting elbow and wrist position:
    - Bring elbows closer to the body to maximise strength and reduce slack.
  - Using wedges from the legs:
    - Pin the opponent’s hips and thighs to ensure the force does not dissipate into general body movement.

- Safety and control
  - Emphasis on:
    - Gradual loading of the hold.
    - Checking that the opponent cannot freely roll with the pressure.
  - Toe holds from poor alignment are explicitly cautioned as being less controlled and thus requiring more care.


4.15 Alternative achilles grip
------------------------------

- Motivation
  - Standard Achilles grips are sometimes:
    - Too shallow.
    - Poorly aligned.
    - Easily defended by hand-fighting or hip movement.
  - An alternative grip is proposed to improve leverage and control.

- Grip mechanics
  - Hand position is shifted to:
    - Maximise forearm contact along the Achilles tendon.
    - Use bony surfaces of the wrist and forearm as the primary fulcrum.
  - The elbow is drawn tight to the torso to create an “immovable” frame behind the grip.

- Body positioning
  - Hips are placed close to the opponent’s heel and ankle to shorten the lever on the defender’s side and lengthen it on the attacker’s side.
  - Feet and knees wedge the opponent’s hip and thigh to prevent them from simply sitting up or turning.

- Finishing detail
  - Emphasis on:
    - Extending the hips.
    - Drawing the opponent’s toes towards the attacker’s shoulder.
  - The alternative grip is presented as a way to turn a “soft” Achilles lock into a legitimately dangerous submission.


4.16 Lace leg (creating dilemma)
--------------------------------

- Positional idea
  - “Lacing” the leg refers to threading and wrapping the opponent’s leg so it is tied into the attacker’s structure.
  - The secondary leg often becomes laced around or between the attacker’s legs, restricting the opponent’s mobility.

- Dilemma creation
  - Once the leg is laced:
    - The opponent must decide whether to:
      - Free the laced leg (which may expose the primary leg to heel hooks).
      - Or keep it tied (leaving it vulnerable to toe holds or secondary submissions).
  - The laced configuration also:
    - Limits their ability to stand or rotate.

- Attacking routes
  - From the laced position:
    - Transition to figure-four toe holds.
    - Switch between primary and secondary leg attacks according to defence.
  - The legs are used both as control and as active weapons in maintaining the tie.


4.17 Splitter hand and elbow slicer
-----------------------------------

- Splitter hand concept
  - Used to “split” the opponent’s legs or arms apart.
  - The hand is placed between limbs and used as a wedge:
    - Opening space.
    - Breaking defensive frames such as tight leg triangles or stubborn grips.

- Application in leg lock context
  - When the opponent’s legs are crossed or triangled:
    - The splitter hand pries between the legs.
    - The attacker’s hips and legs then complete the separation.

- Elbow slicer tie-in
  - When arms or legs are bent around the attacker’s limb:
    - Pressure from the forearm or elbow against the joint can create slicer-type pain and control.
  - This is less a primary submission and more a way to:
    - Force reactions.
    - Break stubborn ties so that leg attacks can continue.

- Strategic use
  - Both tools support:
    - Untying legs.
    - Breaking defensive shells.
    - Creating access to heels and toes that were previously hidden.


4.18 Over–under method and double elbow
---------------------------------------

- Over–under method
  - Uses one arm over and one arm under the opponent’s limb or limbs.
  - Creates:
    - Strong encirclement.
    - Ability to pull and rotate the limb as a unit.

- Control and leverage
  - Over–under allows the attacker to:
    - Clamp a leg between both arms.
    - Use the torso as a third point of contact.
  - Particularly useful when:
    - The opponent is using both hands to defend a heel or foot.

- Double elbow concept
  - In double elbow arrangements:
    - Both elbows are structured and tight to the body.
    - The opponent’s limb is trapped between the attacker’s forearms and chest.
  - This provides a powerful lever with minimal muscular effort.

- Integration in leg locks
  - Over–under and double elbow mechanics are used to:
    - Maintain heel control under heavy hand-fighting.
    - Rotate the opponent’s leg while keeping the heel fixed.
    - Stabilise the limb during transitions between ashi families.


4.19 Double cross method
------------------------

- Concept
  - “Double cross” refers to crossing or stacking the opponent’s legs in such a way that both are compromised.
  - The attacker’s legs and grips:
    - Arrange the opponent’s limbs into overlapping positions.
    - Make it difficult for the opponent to move one leg without affecting the other.

- Control structure
  - One of the attacker’s legs often pins both of the opponent’s shins or ankles.
  - Hands guide the feet into crossing patterns that:
    - Trap one leg behind the other.
    - Compress the opponent’s own limbs against each other.

- Strategic implications
  - The opponent’s base and mobility are heavily reduced.
  - Submissions can be directed at:
    - The front leg.
    - The back leg.
    - Or transitioned between the two as defences change.

- Use in the system
  - The double cross is another manifestation of dilemma-based control:
    - Defending one leg typically worsens the position of the other.
    - Untying the legs often opens the knee line or exposes the heel.


4.20 Kani basami
----------------

- Entry structure
  - A scissoring entry where:
    - One of the attacker’s legs cuts across the front or back of the opponent’s thigh.
    - The other leg cuts low across the shin or calf.
  - The motion brings the opponent down while simultaneously inserting the attacker’s hips deep to the leg.

- Control upon landing
  - Immediately on hitting the mat:
    - The attacker’s thighs clamp the opponent’s thigh.
    - Hips are placed close to the knee line.
  - A hand assist often:
    - Cups or grips the opponent’s far leg.
    - Prevents them from stepping out or jumping clear.

- Transition to entanglement
  - From the initial scissor fall:
    - The attacker quickly builds into cross ashi or other inside-dominant families.
    - The arm grip on the second leg often converts into a strong wedge to keep the opponent grounded.

- Strategic emphasis
  - Treated as a high-commitment entry:
    - Must be done with precise timing and control.
    - Aimed at immediately arriving in a dominant entanglement, not at a prolonged scramble.


4.21 X guard and reverse X guard entries
----------------------------------------

- X guard
  - Attacker is underneath the opponent with:
    - Two feet forming an “X” around one of the opponent’s legs.
    - One foot typically behind the knee and the other at or near the hip.
  - Hands control the opponent’s other leg or upper body to disrupt balance.

- Reverse X guard
  - A mirrored version where:
    - The leg configuration inverts relative to the opponent’s leg.
    - Hips and torso are positioned differently but maintain similar control aims.
  - Particularly useful for:
    - Lifting the opponent.
    - Rotating them into leg entanglements.

- Entry to ashi
  - From X and reverse X, the attacker:
    - Uses off-balancing to bring the opponent’s weight over them.
    - Threads legs into ashi garami as the opponent falls or is tilted.
  - Key principle:
    - Control and kuzushi first, then entangle; never sacrifice control just to dive on the leg.


4.22 Bottom single elevator and crossed feet single elevator
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Bottom single elevator
  - Guard-based position where:
    - One of the attacker’s legs is under the opponent’s leg acting as an elevator hook.
    - The other leg posts or frames to manage distance.
  - Used to:
    - Lift and tilt the opponent.
    - Create entries into X guard, reverse X guard, or direct leg entanglements.

- Crossed feet single elevator
  - Variation where the attacker’s feet cross while still elevating the opponent’s leg.
  - Increases:
    - Clamp strength on the opponent’s thigh.
    - Control over their hip line.

- Transition to leg locks
  - As the opponent is elevated and off-balanced:
    - The attacker can redirect the leg into ashi families.
    - Alternatively, the elevator sweep is used to come on top while maintaining leg control.

- Defensive reactions and responses
  - Opponent tries to backstep or clear the elevator:
    - Attacker follows the leg and threads into shin-to-shin, X guard, or immediate entanglement.


4.23 Half guard entries
-----------------------

- Starting position
  - From bottom half guard:
    - The attacker already controls one of the opponent’s legs between their thighs.
  - Top half guard also offers:
    - Moments when the opponent’s legs are separated and open to entries.

- Entry concepts
  - From bottom:
    - Use underhooks, knee shields, and hip escapes to:
      - Insert an inside leg.
      - Turn the opponent’s leg into a favourable angle for ashi.
  - From top:
    - As the opponent fights for underhooks or knee shields:
      - Pummel the legs to inside position.
      - Drop into leg entanglements before they fully recover guard.

- Transition priorities
  - Always secure:
    - Inside leg position.
    - Knee-line control.
  - Then convert half guard frames into:
    - Single leg ashi.
    - Cross ashi.
    - Or other well-structured entanglements.


4.24 Double seated position entries and finishes
------------------------------------------------

- Double seated scenario
  - Both athletes are seated facing each other with legs forward.
  - Neither has clear top or bottom; control is decided by:
    - Who wins inside position.
    - Who controls grips first.

- Entry battle
  - Early focus on:
    - Hand fighting for control of ankles, shins, or knees.
    - Leg pummelling to establish inside position.
  - Shin-to-shin, collar-and-heel, and sliding ashi entries are all prominent options.

- Building entanglements
  - Once inside position and grips are secured:
    - The attacker slides or sits into chosen ashi families.
    - The opponent’s attempts to mirror are countered by superior inside-leg and grip work.

- Finishing emphasis
  - From double seated-derived entanglements:
    - Heel hooks, toe holds, and Achilles attacks are all available.
    - The decision to stand, sweep, or stay seated is driven by:
      - Quality of knee-line control.
      - The opponent’s defensive posture.

- Phases of the system
  - Grips:
    - Two-on-one gripping.
    - Scoop and ankle grips.
    - Shin-to-shin, collar-and-heel, and torso ties.
  - Inside position:
    - Continuous fight for inside leg position.
    - Precondition for most high-percentage entries.

- Entry layer
  - Routes from:
    - Standing (sitback, inside–out, outside–in, outside step).
    - Guard (De La Riva, knee shield, X / reverse X, elevators).
    - Top vs supine (leg pummelling, movement inside).
    - Double seated (pummelling battle for first entanglement).

- Ashi families as central hub
  - Single, double, cross, irimi, reverse, outside, ankle lace.
  - System emphasises:
    - Rapid transitions between families as the opponent rotates or defends.
    - Clear hierarchy based on knee-line and hip control.

- Breaking and follow-through
  - Primary submissions:
    - Inside and outside heel hooks.
    - Figure-four toe holds.
    - Achilles-based finishes and double heel hooks.
  - Follow-through:
    - If the break does not complete, immediately transition to:
      - Another entanglement.
      - Secondary leg attacks.
      - Positional improvements.

- Exit outcomes
  - Sweeps from entanglements into top position.
  - Stand-ups with leg control.
  - Transitions into upper-body control:
    - Mount, back, or front headlock as the opponent over-defends legs.

----

- Distance and stance
  - Track when:
    - Opponent’s foot crosses the toe line.
    - Attacker crosses the toe/knee line into engagement range.
  - Entries are only acceptable when grips and inside position are already forming.

- Inside legs decision
  - If inside leg position is won:
    - Immediately redirect focus to trapping the knee line.
  - If lost:
    - Leg pummelling and movement-inside drills are used to regain inside position before committing.

- Knee-line capture
  - Once inside position is gained:
    - Hips and thighs are used to clamp the opponent’s knee line.
    - Hands adjust the leg so that the knee line sits within the attacker’s hip frame.
  - If the knee line is not securely captured:
    - System favours resetting distance or re-entering with stronger structure instead of forcing submissions.

- Transition to ashi families
  - Only after knee-line capture:
    - Build into specific ashi configurations according to opponent’s reactions.
  - Knee line remains a constant checkpoint:
    - If it begins to slip, finishing attempts pause; re-clamping becomes the priority.

                  [IRIMI]
----

- Core families as a connected tree
  - Single leg ashi:
    - Often first entanglement from shin-to-shin, sliding entries.
    - Readily transitions to cross or double leg ashi as defences appear.
  - Double leg ashi:
    - Derived from double-leg and ankle lace approaches.
    - Serves as a branching point to single-leg dominance on either side.

- Cross ashi as central connector
  - Acts as major hub:
    - Takes feeds from single, double, and outside ashi.
    - Transitions further into reverse ashi when spins occur.
  - Strong alignment for inside heel hooks.

- Reverse and irimi linkage
  - Reverse ashi:
    - Typically reached via continued spins from cross ashi.
    - Aligns the leg for powerful reverse-direction breaking.
  - Irimi ashi:
    - Deep entering configuration.
    - Often used to re-penetrate and rebuild control when distance opens.

- Outside ashi role
  - Often a transient state:
    - Used when inside position is imperfect or sacrificed for speed.
    - Frequently converted into cross or standard ashi once initial control is gained.

[CYCLE TO]    [OPPONENT

----

- Shared spiral locus
  - Straight-style entanglements create a shared spiral axis:
    - Both athletes can spin around the trapped leg.
  - If uncontrolled:
    - Opponent rolls with pressure.
    - Heel exposure diminishes.
    - Escapes and positional reversals increase.

- Controlled spiral
  - Aim is to:
    - Decide when and how spins occur.
    - Use spins to move from weak to strong families (e.g. straight to cross / reverse).
  - Tools:
    - Torso controls (hand over shoulders, clamps).
    - Head positioning.
    - Tight wedges around hip and knee.

- Inside–outside cycles
  - As legs pummel:
    - If opponent wins outside position, system shifts to positions that exploit their alignment (e.g. reverse ashi).
    - If attacker maintains or regains inside position, system favours families with strong knee-line capture (e.g. cross ashi, deep single ashi).
  - Gravity and rolling drills encode:
    - Habit of following spins.
    - Converting shared spiral into controlled transitions.

- Failure state
  - When spiral is uncontrolled:
    - Opponent dictates rotation.
    - Attacker loses inside position and knee line simultaneously.
    - System identifies this as a key failure pattern to be avoided by early cycle changes.

  - Kani basami:
    - High-commitment scissor entry directly into deep entanglement.

- Guard-based entries
  - De La Riva, knee shield, X and reverse X, elevators:
    - Used to off-balance and raise the opponent’s center of gravity.
  - Intermediate hubs (shin-to-shin, X variations):
    - Provide controlled transition points into single, cross, or double ashi.

- Double seated entries
  - Simultaneous:
    - Hand fighting for ankles and shins.
    - Leg pummelling for inside position.
  - First entanglement usually determined by:
    - Who wins the inside pummelling battle.
    - Who secures effective grips first.

- Half guard entries
  - From bottom:
    - Underhooks, knee shields, and hip escapes create the angle for inserting an inside leg into the opponent’s trapped leg.
  - From top:
    - As the bottom player frames and inverts, their legs open gaps that can be turned into direct ashi entries.

    - Availability of toes or Achilles line.
  - Emphasis on:
    - Deep, secure heel capture for heel hooks.
    - Maximised lever length for toe holds.

- Slack removal phase
  - Tightening wedges:
    - Hips close to the knee line.
    - Knees pinning the thigh.
    - Feet preventing hip rotation.
  - Eliminating any movement between:
    - Grips.
    - Target joint.
    - Attacker’s torso.

- Hip and torso alignment
  - Aligning the line of force:
    - Inside heel hooks: inward rotation into medial knee structures.
    - Outside heel hooks: outward rotation into lateral structures.
    - Toe holds/Achilles: alignment for plantarflexion or rotational torque.
  - Head and shoulders positioned to:
    - Support rotation.
    - Maintain balance during rolling finishes.

- Breaking load and follow-through
  - Once all alignment is correct:
    - Progressive increase of rotational or extension load.
  - If the finish does not materialise:
    - Flow directly into:
      - Second attempt with improved angle.
      - Attacks on secondary leg (double heel hook, toe hold).
      - Positional transitions (sweep, stand, back-take or mount).

 [TOE HOLD / SECOND LEG OR
  RETURN TO PRIMARY LEG]
----

- Knee-line escape management
  - Early recognition:
    - Feeling the knee sliding towards or past the attacker’s hip line.
  - Immediate actions:
    - Blocking the hip with feet and knees.
    - Re-threading inside legs (“repummelling”) to trap the knee again.
  - If knee line is re-captured:
    - Rebuild the same ashi family if still optimal.
    - Or deliberately switch to a new ashi that better fits the new angle.

- Untying legs
  - When the opponent crosses or triangles legs to protect the primary leg:
    - Use splitter-hand and elbow-slicer concepts to pry the legs apart.
    - Place wedges with the hips and thighs to hold one leg while separating the other.
  - As legs are untied:
    - Decide whether to:
      - Attack the newly exposed secondary leg (toe hold, heel hook).
      - Or clear the obstruction and return to attacking the original primary leg.

- Maintaining forward momentum
  - Recovery and untying are treated as:
    - Offensive tasks that keep the opponent inside the system.
    - Not as defensive pauses.
  - The map ensures:
    - No escape attempt is treated as the end of the sequence.
    - Every defensive movement feeds directly into the next attacking decision.
    
========================
6.0 DRILLING PROGRESSIONS
========================


6.1 SOLO DRILLS
----------------

- 6.1.1 Movement inside (leg pummelling shapes without partner)
  - Objective:
    - Encode the movement patterns required to win and maintain inside leg position without depending on a partner’s timing.
  - Key elements:
    - Alternating inside leg threads:
      - From seated or supine, cycle one leg inside an imaginary opponent’s leg line, then switch to the other.
      - Focus on clean hip shifts rather than swinging legs from the knee.
    - Hip scoots and hip switches:
      - Drive from the hip and ribs to move the body, not just the feet.
      - Practice sliding the hips under an imaginary knee line, then switching angle to simulate transitions to single and cross ashi.
    - Distance checks:
      - Use visual or mat references to simulate crossing the toe line and knee line.
      - Stop entries that would “cross” those lines without inside position or imaginary grips in place.

- 6.1.2 Gravity drills – base and posture reactions
  - Objective:
    - Develop sensitivity to how bodyweight shifts affect balance and leg availability.
  - Key elements:
    - Seated base shifts:
      - From a seated position, rock forward and backward on the hips as if reacting to an opponent’s weight changes.
      - Keep the spine aligned so that the legs can shoot under or around an imaginary stance at any point.
    - Side-to-side tilting:
      - Roll from one hip to the other in a controlled fashion, maintaining readiness to thread legs inside.
      - Emphasise smooth transitions rather than jerky movements.
    - Controlled “falls”:
      - Practice sitting back to the mat under control:
        - Hips move first; shoulders follow.
        - Avoid collapsing flat; always land at an angle aligned for ashi entries.

- 6.1.3 Gravity drills 2 – directional changes and angle management
  - Objective:
    - Teach the body to react to shifting directions while keeping knees and feet in strong lines of attack.
  - Key elements:
    - Rotational sitbacks:
      - Start seated, rotate to one side as if being pulled, and sit back while keeping knees pinched together.
      - Alternate sides to simulate both inside–out and outside–in entries.
    - Angular hip drops:
      - Drop one hip towards the mat while the opposite shoulder rotates forward, mirroring cross ashi and reverse ashi entries.
      - Use this to build comfort with off-line falls instead of straight-back falls.
    - Toe-line visualisation:
      - In each direction change, re-orient the body so that an imaginary opponent’s leg would fall across the belt line or side of the ribs, not across the chest.

- 6.1.4 Gravity drills 3 – rolling transitions
  - Objective:
    - Normalize rolling finishes and spin-following in heel hook situations.
  - Key elements:
    - Shoulder rolls tied to leg positions:
      - Perform forward and backward rolls while maintaining a constant “imaginary heel” locked to the ribs with the arms.
      - Keep the knees pinched during the roll to simulate clamping the thigh.
    - Spiral tracking:
      - On each roll, pause midway to check that:
        - Hips still face an imaginary knee line.
        - “Heel” position relative to torso remains constant.
    - Directional changes:
      - Alternate direction of rolls (clockwise/anti-clockwise) while preserving the same leg clamps, mirroring transitions between straight, cross, and reverse ashi.

- 6.1.5 Sitback and inversion movement patterns
  - Objective:
    - Build smooth, controlled sitbacks and inversions that can later be used in live entries.
  - Key elements:
    - Sitback mechanics:
      - From standing or kneeling, simulate gripping an ankle and sit back:
        - Hips travel back and down in a controlled arc.
        - Keep the “captured” foot glued to the belt line.
      - Land with knees already pinched as if you have a knee line between them.
    - Inversion mechanics:
      - Practice rolling from seated to shoulders with hips elevated, feet pointed as if threading into X or reverse X guard.
      - Emphasise smooth inversion and return, not speed.
    - Combined patterns:
      - Sitback to one hip, partial inversion to the opposite shoulder, then return:
        - Mirrors the path of sliding ashi entries into rolling heel hook follow-throughs.


6.2 PARTNER DRILLS
-------------------

- 6.2.1 Connection drills
  - Objective:
    - Maintain uninterrupted connection to the opponent’s leg while they move, change stance, or attempt to withdraw.
  - Key elements:
    - Ankle and shin tracking:
      - Partner walks in different directions; attacker maintains constant scoop or ankle grip and shin-to-shin contact.
      - Rule: leg stays connected; hips and torso move to maintain angle.
    - Grip continuity:
      - When partner peels a grip, attacker immediately:
        - Re-grips the same limb.
        - Or transitions smoothly to a nearby grip (e.g. ankle to shin, shin to knee).
    - Push–pull updates:
      - Attacker constantly modulates push–pull:
        - When partner pulls out, attacker follows and pulls.
        - When partner drives in, attacker posts and pushes to re-create the right distance.

- 6.2.2 Penetration drills
  - Objective:
    - Practice safe, confident entries from distance into ashi positions.
  - Key elements:
    - Progressive depth entries:
      - Start further from the partner than comfortable entry range.
      - Use grips and footwork to close distance step by step:
        - Cross the toe line with structure.
        - Cross the knee line only when inside position is forming.
    - Entry cycles:
      - Repeatedly move from:
        - Shin-to-shin or collar-and-heel → sliding hip entry → provisional ashi → exit and reset.
      - Emphasis on:
        - Hip first, not legs diving from distance.
    - Partner movement:
      - Partner changes stance width or direction mid-drill.
      - Attacker adjusts entry path without sacrificing inside position.

- 6.2.3 Hand post – leg pummelling
  - Objective:
    - Link hand posting and leg pummelling into a single top-position skill set.
  - Key elements:
    - Hand-post base:
      - From a standing or kneeling top position, attacker posts one or both hands on the mat or partner to stabilise.
      - Legs then pummel around and between partner’s legs without losing base.
    - Inside–outside cycles:
      - Attacker cycles legs:
        - Outside → between → deep inside.
        - Tracks which leg currently holds inside position.
    - Entry flags:
      - When the attacker reaches a configuration with:
        - Both hands stable.
        - Strong inside leg position.
      - Drill pauses briefly to mark the “go” moment for potential drops into irimi ashi or other entanglements.

- 6.2.4 Pummelling legs from top position
  - Objective:
    - Build leg pummelling as a standing or kneeling analogue of hand fighting.
  - Key elements:
    - Alternating inside steps:
      - Attacker steps one leg inside the partner’s guard line, then withdraws and repeats with the other.
      - Focus on:
        - Keeping hips low.
        - Knees tracking over toes for stability.
    - Hip-switch pummelling:
      - From a staggered stance, attacker switches hips:
        - One knee drops between partner’s legs.
        - The other steps outside, then cycles back.
    - Live resistance:
      - Partner actively pummels legs to deny inside steps.
      - Attacker must adapt footwork and angle changes while maintaining strong posture.

- 6.2.5 Sliding ashi, double leg, and single leg entries
  - Objective:
    - Integrate wrestling-style entries with sliding and ashi-building mechanics.
  - Key elements:
    - Double leg style entries:
      - From standing, attacker penetrates as if for a double leg:
        - Collects both legs near the knees or ankles.
        - Immedately sits or slides into double leg ashi / ankle lace configurations.
    - Single leg style entries:
      - Attacker isolates one leg:
        - Lifts with a single-leg grip.
        - Slides hips underneath to land in single leg ashi or cross ashi.
    - Sliding ashi finishes:
      - Once inside, attacker performs:
        - Repeated sequences of slide-in → clamp knee line → provisional heel exposure → reset.
      - Partner offers moderate resistance by moving and re-posturing.

- 6.2.6 Collar-and-heel and arm-drag entries
  - Objective:
    - Connect upper-body control (collar-and-elbow, arm drag, front headlock) to leg entanglement entries.
  - Key elements:
    - Collar-and-heel:
      - From seated or standing tie, attacker secures a collar-style upper grip and an ankle/heel grip.
      - Use push–pull to:
        - Off-balance partner.
        - Step or slide into ashi as the partner reacts.
    - Arm drag to leg:
      - From arm drag, attacker:
        - Pulls partner past.
        - Uses the freed angle to attack the near leg (e.g. sliding ashi, shin-to-shin).
    - Front headlock to leg:
      - Off a front headlock, partner attempts to back out.
      - Attacker uses the retreat to:
        - Drop to a leg and build entanglement before the partner fully disengages.

- 6.2.7 Double leg roll and rolling transition from straight to cross ashi
  - Objective:
    - Build comfort with rolling transitions where control and heel position are preserved.
  - Key elements:
    - Double leg roll:
      - Starting from double leg entanglements, attacker:
        - Initiates controlled rolls sideways or diagonally.
        - Maintains knee-line and ankle control throughout.
      - Partner follows but attempts to free one leg during the roll.
    - Straight to cross ashi roll:
      - Begin in straight-style ashi.
      - Partner turns or spins; attacker:
        - Rolls with them.
        - Uses the momentum to land in cross ashi with knee line pinned across the belt line.
    - Checkpoints:
      - After each roll, pause briefly to confirm:
        - Inside position preserved.
        - Heel exposure improved or at least maintained.

- 6.2.8 Connection, penetration, and gravity drill integration sets
  - Objective:
    - Combine connection, penetration, and gravity drills into continuous partner flows.
  - Key elements:
    - Flow 1 (connection → penetration):
      - Start attached to the leg (connection drill).
      - Build up to a full sliding or sitback entry (penetration drill).
      - Exit and return to neutral, then repeat.
    - Flow 2 (penetration → gravity):
      - After an entry, attacker:
        - Uses controlled sitbacks and angle changes (gravity drills).
        - Practices safe landing and hip angles for heel exposure.
    - Flow 3 (full chain):
      - Connection → penetration → gravity → provisional entanglement → reset.
      - Partner varies pace and direction to force adjustments without breaking structure.

6.3 SITUATIONAL SPARRING
------------------------

- 6.3.1 Standing opponent
  - Scenario:
    - Opponent standing; attacker seated or standing.
  - Rules:
    - Attacker must:
      - Establish grips.
      - Win or threaten inside leg position.
      - Enter ashi only under structured conditions (not diving blindly).
    - Opponent:
      - Aims to maintain stance, break grips, and avoid knee-line capture.
  - Objectives:
    - Apply sitback, inside–out, outside–in, and outside step-in entries under realistic resistance.
    - Practice immediate off-balancing after entries to prevent the opponent from standing back up.

- 6.3.2 Supine opponent
  - Scenario:
    - Opponent lies supine; attacker on top or at standing distance.
  - Rules:
    - Attacker focuses on:
      - Leg pummelling from top.
      - Hand post plus leg pummelling sequences.
      - Irimi ashi-style entries from pressure or passing positions.
    - Opponent attempts:
      - To recover guard.
      - To insert frames that block entries.
  - Objectives:
    - Tie passing posture and pressure directly to leg entanglement entries.
    - Ensure that every approach past the toe line is supported by inside position and grips.

- 6.3.3 De La Riva and movement inside
  - Scenario:
    - Attacker seated or on bottom with De La Riva and related guard hooks.
  - Rules:
    - Attacker:
      - Uses De La Riva, collar-and-heel, and shin-to-shin to off-balance.
      - Progresses into X, reverse X, or direct ashi when kuzushi is achieved.
    - Opponent:
      - Works to clear hooks and regain strong passing posture.
  - Objectives:
    - Hard-wire the transition from off-balancing to knee-line capture.
    - Maintain inside leg battles throughout guard retention and attack sequences.

- 6.3.4 Knee shield to X guard and reverse X guard
  - Scenario:
    - Bottom player using knee shield; top player pressuring.
  - Rules:
    - Bottom:
      - Uses knee shield to manage distance.
      - Transitions to X or reverse X as top player pressure or steps present opportunities.
    - Top:
      - Attempts to either:
        - Smash through knee shield.
        - Backstep or disengage before deep hooks are in.
  - Objectives:
    - Practice the chain: knee shield → X / reverse X → ashi family.
    - Ensure that hooks and grips are used to set up leg entries without sacrificing defensive integrity.

- 6.3.5 Bottom single elevator and crossed feet single elevator
  - Scenario:
    - Bottom player in single-elevator style guard; top player standing or kneeling.
  - Rules:
    - Bottom:
      - Elevates and tilts the opponent with the elevator hook.
      - Chooses either:
        - Sweep to top while maintaining leg control.
        - Direct leg entanglement as the opponent is lifted.
    - Top:
      - Attempts to step off the elevator, backstep, or drive weight through the hook.
  - Objectives:
    - Encode the choice between sweep and submission while keeping knee-line focus.
    - Practice changing from standard to crossed-feet elevators to increase clamp strength before entries.

- 6.3.6 Half guard entries and counters
  - Scenario:
    - Half guard battles from top and bottom.
  - Rules:
    - Bottom:
      - Uses underhooks, knee shields, and hip escapes to:
        - Insert an inside leg.
        - Turn the captured leg into ashi.
    - Top:
      - Attempts to:
        - Free the trapped leg and pass.
        - Or use leg pummelling to drop into leg entanglements of their own.
  - Objectives:
    - Treat half guard as a dual-threat position:
      - Pass-and-pin route.
      - Leg entanglement route.
    - Train recognition of when the opponent’s leg configuration is open enough to safely enter ashi.

- 6.3.7 Double seated position exchanges
  - Scenario:
    - Both players seated with legs forward; no clear top or bottom.
  - Rules:
    - Both:
      - Hand fight for ankles, shins, and knees.
      - Pummel legs for inside position.
      - Attempt to build first meaningful ashi entanglement.
    - On successful entanglement:
      - Brief continuation to test control and initial submission threats.
      - Then reset.
  - Objectives:
    - Develop reflexive reactions to inside/outside pummelling.
    - Ensure that the player who wins inside position and grips first normally wins the first meaningful leg attack.

- 6.3.8 Recovering knee line, untying legs, and late-stage defence/attack
  - Scenario:
    - One player begins in deep entanglement with partial control:
      - Knee line near escape.
      - Legs crossed or triangled defensively.
  - Rules:
    - Attacker:
      - Must either:
        - Re-capture the knee line.
        - Untie legs and transition to a cleaner entanglement.
      - Only then may they escalate to full breaking mechanics.
    - Defender:
      - Tries to:
        - Fully clear the knee line.
        - Stand, turn, or re-guard.
  - Objectives:
    - Train late-stage attacking skills:
      - Rebuilding control.
      - Converting defensive shells (crossed legs, half-escapes) into new dilemmas.
    - Build familiarity with attacking from imperfect positions while maintaining safety and structural discipline.
    
=====================
7.0 APPLICATION SCENARIOS
=====================


7.1 STANDING OPPONENT ENTRIES AND COUNTERS
------------------------------------------

- Scenario definition
  - Attacker and opponent in standing or stand-versus-sit configurations.
  - Opponent’s primary defensive aims:
    - Maintain stance integrity.
    - Keep knees behind a safe line relative to the attacker’s hips.
    - Avoid giving up knee-line exposure during movement or passing.

- Core entry tools
  - Sitback entries:
    - Attacker grips at the ankle/heel and sits to the mat while pulling the leg into the hip line.
    - Hips stay close to the opponent’s knee line; no “falling away” and leaving space.
  - Inside–out and outside–in step-ins:
    - Step inside the opponent’s stance, thread the leg to inside position, then rotate to ashi as the opponent adjusts.
    - Or step from outside to inside in one motion when the opponent oversteps or reaches.
  - Outside step-in:
    - Step outside the opponent’s leg to line up outside ashi or cross ashi angles.
    - Useful when the opponent’s stance is bladed or when they circle away.

- Gripping and kuzushi
  - Collar-and-heel and ankle grips:
    - Use push–pull on the upper and lower body to force stance changes (narrow, wide, staggered).
    - Target the leg that becomes light or extended as a result of kuzushi.
  - 2-on-1 and immovable elbow mechanics:
    - Attach firmly to the ankle/shin; elbow glued to the hip.
    - Redirect the foot so that the heel will appear on the desired inside or outside line once hips drop.

- Typical defensive reactions
  - Hop-step retreats:
    - Opponent rapidly hops the leg back to avoid knee-line capture.
    - Attacker follows with short, continuous hip steps and keeps grips attached until the sitback or sliding entry is complete.
  - Level change to sprawl:
    - Opponent drops weight onto the leg or hips back.
    - Attacker abandons a deep drop if structure is poor and:
      - Re-sets grips at the ankle.
      - Or transitions to other attacks as the opponent over-commits the sprawl.
  - Posture and stiff-arm framing:
    - Opponent posts on shoulders or hips to stop the sitback.
    - Attacker responds by:
      - Adjusting angle so the sitback occurs diagonally rather than straight back.
      - Continuing to drag the foot across the body line.

- System emphasis
  - Clear rule: do not sit unless:
    - Grips are secure.
    - Inside position is at least partially obtained.
    - Knee-line capture is realistically available on landing.
  - Standing scenarios are treated as structured entry opportunities, not as “dives” on the leg.


7.2 GUARD-BASED ENTRIES (DE LA RIVA, KNEE SHIELD, X GUARD)
----------------------------------------------------------

- Scenario definition
  - Attacker on bottom using open guard configurations:
    - De La Riva hook.
    - Knee shield frames.
    - X guard and reverse X guard.
  - Opponent on top attempting to:
    - Pass.
    - Stall in strong base.
    - Or disengage.

- De La Riva-based scenarios
  - Off-balancing with De La Riva:
    - Use hook on the outside of the opponent’s leg plus grips (ankle, collar, sleeve-style) to tilt them.
    - Aim to pull the heel off the mat and force weight shifts.
  - Transition windows:
    - When opponent steps wide or narrow to regain balance, attacker:
      - Threads inside leg deeper.
      - Converts hook position into shin-to-shin, X guard, or immediate ashi as the knee line becomes reachable.
  - Safety rule:
    - Guard is not abandoned until:
      - A meaningful off-balance is achieved.
      - Inside leg position and initial grip structure are present.

- Knee shield-based scenarios
  - Framing and distance:
    - Knee shield maintains space and lines of entry against a pressuring top player.
    - Top player’s attempts to compress the shield or backstep expose legs.
  - Transition chains:
    - Knee shield → inversion → X guard or reverse X guard.
    - As the top player steps over or around the shield, attacker:
      - Uses the stepping leg to build elevator hooks.
      - Swings into leg entanglements when the knee line crosses the belt line.

- X guard and reverse X guard
  - Off-balancing from underneath:
    - Lift with the elevator hook while controlling the second leg or upper body.
    - Force the top player into tripod, split, or one-knee-down bases.
  - Leg-lock continuation:
    - As the opponent is tilted:
      - Convert X hooks into ashi clamps around the thigh.
      - Drag the heel into position for heel hook, toe hold, or transitions to cross ashi.
    - If off-balancing fails:
      - Retreat to stable guard hooks instead of forcing entries without control.

- System emphasis
  - Guard-based scenarios are conceptualised as:
    - First, a kuzushi and base-breaking problem.
    - Only then, a leg-entry problem.
  - The guard retains its own integrity (sweep, stand, clinch) even when leg attacks are a major goal.


7.3 FRONT HEADLOCK, ARM DRAG, AND 4-POINT BREAKDOWN
----------------------------------------------------

- Scenario definition
  - Upper-body control is secured first:
    - Front headlock.
    - Arm drag.
    - Collar-and-elbow style ties.
  - Legs are attacked as a secondary effect when the opponent attempts to free the head or arm.

- Front headlock to legs
  - Opponent’s reaction:
    - Pulling the head free.
    - Driving forward or backing away.
  - Attacker’s conversion:
    - As the opponent steps to relieve pressure, attacker:
      - Follows the stepping leg with inside pummelling.
      - Drops or slides into ashi as the leg over-extends.
    - Front headlock becomes:
      - A control handle to steer posture.
      - A way to time leg exposure during escape attempts.

- Arm drag scenarios
  - Dragging to expose the near leg:
    - Arm drag pulls the opponent past the attacker’s hip.
    - The leg on the dragged side often becomes light and steps forward.
  - Entry choices:
    - Slide under the stepping leg into single leg ashi or shin-to-shin.
    - Use the backwards turn of the opponent to access cross ashi routes.
  - Control continuity:
    - Even as the attacker moves to the leg, the dragging arm remains connected long enough to maintain kuzushi.

- 4-point breakdown context
  - 4-point breakdown:
    - Sequence paying attention to head, shoulders, hips, and base.
    - The opponent is destabilised across these points so that:
      - No single frame or post can restore balance.
  - Role in leg attacks:
    - As one or more points collapse (e.g. hand posts fail, hips sag), key legs become over-burdened or extended.
    - Attacker times entries to coincide with the moment one leg carries too much weight or is forced into a long step.

- System emphasis
  - Upper-body controls are not “separate” attacks:
    - They serve as structured ways to move the opponent’s legs into compromised positions.
  - Leg locks are integrated into clinch and control sequences rather than replacing them.


7.4 TOP VS SUPINE AND SEATED OPPONENTS
--------------------------------------

- Scenario definition
  - Attacker on top; opponent supine or seated.
  - Opponent alternates between:
    - Guard-building frames.
    - Seated guard with grips.
    - Attempts to stand or invert.

- Supine opponent (lying guard player)
  - Top player priorities:
    - Manage distance so that:
      - They do not overstep beyond the toe line without structure.
      - They can pummel legs safely from outside to inside.
    - Use hand posts and torso alignment to resist sweeps.
  - Leg-entry windows:
    - When guard player:
      - Extends one leg too far as a frame.
      - Mis-times hip escapes.
    - Top player:
      - Steps inside with a controlled knee drop.
      - Uses hand-post plus leg pummelling sequences to slide into irimi ashi or other entanglements.

- Seated opponent
  - Seated guard player behaviour:
    - Scooting in and out.
    - Using collar-and-heel or shin-to-shin grips.
  - Top player’s approach:
    - Deny strong grips with hand fighting.
    - Force the seated player to extend a leg to move or frame.
    - As that leg extends, strategically:
      - Cross the knee line with the pummelling leg.
      - Turn the extension into ashi entries or passing.

- Transitions between passing and leg locks
  - When passing is favourable:
    - Top player continues to:
      - Smash frames.
      - Drive knee cuts, body locks, or other conventional passes.
  - When leg exposure is superior:
    - Top player switches to leg focus:
      - Pummels legs.
      - Drops into entanglements when guard structure is badly broken.
  - Key principle:
    - Leg attacks are a branch of the top game, not an abandonment of passing logic.

- System emphasis
  - Top vs supine/seated is treated as a dual-route problem:
    - Positional passing route.
    - Leg entanglement route.
  - Decision criteria:
    - Quality of guard structure.
    - Exposure of isolated legs.
    - Attacker’s ability to maintain balance while entering.


7.5 HALF GUARD, ELEVATOR, AND REVERSE X GUARD SCENARIOS
-------------------------------------------------------

- Scenario definition
  - Transitions through:
    - Bottom and top half guard.
    - Elevator-style guards (single elevator, crossed-feet elevator).
    - Reverse X guard, especially after knee shield and inversion.

- Half guard (bottom)
  - Control in half guard:
    - Bottom player already controls one leg between their thighs.
    - Frames (knee shield, underhook, head position) determine angles.
  - Leg-attack route:
    - Use knee shield and hip escape to:
      - Insert inside leg deeper around the opponent’s trapped leg.
      - Rotate under to find single leg ashi or cross ashi.
    - If top player backsteps or stands:
      - Convert to reverse X or elevator entries when the leg is forced away.

- Half guard (top)
  - Top player options:
    - As bottom player tries to recover guard or invert:
      - Their legs lose tight control; openings appear for inside steps.
    - Top uses leg pummelling to:
      - Step between the legs.
      - Drop into ashi before bottom player rebuilds frames.
  - Safety rule:
    - Entries are only taken when:
      - Base is stable.
      - Hands and head position protect against sweeps and back takes.

- Elevator and crossed-feet elevator
  - Elevator guard:
    - Bottom player’s hook under a leg lifts and tilts the opponent.
    - Crossed-feet variations lock the thigh tighter.
  - Application to leg attacks:
    - As top player becomes light:
      - Bottom player directs the lifted leg into ashi rather than only sweeping.
    - If sweep is chosen:
      - Maintain leg control on the way up to connect to top leg entanglements.

- Reverse X scenarios
  - Reverse X entries from knee shield/inversion:
    - As top steps around shields, bottom swings into reverse X with hips under the opponent’s thigh.
  - Leg attack continuation:
    - Elevate and tilt to expose the knee line.
    - Convert reverse X control into cross ashi or single leg ashi as the opponent falls.

- System emphasis
  - Half guard and elevator scenarios illustrate:
    - Leg attacks are naturally available whenever one leg is threaded deeper than the other.
    - The choice between sweep and submission is a strategic fork, not separate skill sets.


7.6 DOUBLE SEATED LEG ENTANGLEMENT BATTLES
------------------------------------------

- Scenario definition
  - Both players seated with legs forward, often touching or overlapping.
  - Neither side has top position; advantage goes to:
    - First to secure grips.
    - First to win inside leg position.

- Initial engagement
  - Grip battle:
    - Fight for ankles, shins, and knees.
    - Aim for 2-on-1 or strong scoop grips that lock at least one leg in place.
  - Leg pummelling:
    - Pummel to secure inside feet and shins.
    - Avoid leaving both legs outside, which gives the opponent an easy path to inside dominance.

- Building the first entanglement
  - Once initial inside position and grips are secured:
    - Slide hips closer and clamp the opponent’s knee line.
    - Choose ashi family according to the angle achieved:
      - Straight/single style if facing square.
      - Cross ashi if leg crosses the belt line.
      - Double leg or ankle lace if both legs come close together.
  - Opponent’s initial defences:
    - Retreating by scooting back.
    - Kicking off feet or prying grips.
  - Attacker’s response:
    - Follow with hip scoots, maintain grips, and deepen inside leg position rather than chasing from distance.

- Continued exchanges
  - If initial entanglement fails:
    - Immediately re-pummel legs.
    - Re-attach to ankles or shins before opponent’s structure resets.
  - Double-seated battles often cycle:
    - Neutral pummelling → provisional entanglement → partial escape → repummelling → new entanglement.

- System emphasis
  - Double seated is treated as:
    - A crucible for inside / outside leg decision-making.
    - A laboratory for continuous grip and pummelling practice.
  - The player who consistently:
    - Secures inside position first.
    - Controls knee lines early.
    - Should dominate the majority of leg exchanges in this scenario.


7.7 DEFENSIVE SPINS, CROSSOVERS, AND KNEE-LINE RECOVERIES
---------------------------------------------------------

- Scenario definition
  - Opponent already caught in an entanglement but uses:
    - Spins.
    - Leg crossovers (dynamic or static).
    - Partial knee-line escapes.
  - These behaviours appear heavily in later volumes focusing on:
    - Shared spiral.
    - Central problems.
    - Toe hold and crossover responses.

- Defensive spins
  - Rolling with heel-hook pressure:
    - Opponent tries to follow the heel’s line of force, hoping to relieve torque.
  - System response:
    - Attacker follows the roll with their own hips and shoulders, maintaining heel capture.
    - As geometry changes:
      - Shift from straight to cross ashi.
      - Or continue through to reverse ashi when facing away.
  - Key rule:
    - Never allow rotations that free the knee line while the attacker remains static.

- Leg crossovers
  - Dynamic crossover:
    - Opponent rapidly crosses legs mid-spin to block heel exposure.
  - Static crossover:
    - Opponent locks legs in a crossed pattern to protect the primary leg.
  - System response:
    - Use figure-four toe hold attacks on the leg doing the protecting.
    - Apply splitter-hand and elbow-slicer mechanics to pry legs apart.
    - Treat the crossed secondary leg as an immediate point of attack rather than a nuisance.

- Knee-line recoveries
  - Partial escape:
    - Opponent slides the knee line to the edge of the attacker’s hips but not fully out.
  - Attacker’s tasks:
    - Block further hip motion with feet and thighs.
    - Re-pummel legs to drag the knee line back into the hip frame.
    - Use the moment of opponent’s movement to:
      - Transition to another ashi family more suitable to the new angle.

- System emphasis
  - Defensive behaviour is integrated into the system’s planning:
    - Every spin, crossover, or knee-line escape attempt is mapped to a preferred attacking reaction.
  - The offensive mindset:
    - Treat defensive moves as a source of transitions and second attacks, not as interruptions.


7.8 TRANSITION CHAINS BETWEEN ASHI FAMILIES
-------------------------------------------

- Scenario definition
  - Ongoing sequences where the attacker:
    - Moves deliberately between ashi families based on opponent’s reactions.
  - Transitions are driven by:
    - Inside / outside leg changes.
    - Hips and torso alignment changes.
    - Defensive tactics (spins, crossovers, standing, turning away).

- Common transition chains
  - Single leg ashi → cross ashi:
    - Opponent turns or crosses legs to defend.
    - Attacker rotates hips and brings the opponent’s knee across the belt line to clamp into cross ashi.
  - Cross ashi → reverse ashi:
    - Opponent continues to roll with heel-hook pressure.
    - Attacker follows the roll and allows torso to rotate away, preserving knee-line capture and re-clamping from a reverse angle.
  - Outside ashi → inside-dominant families:
    - When initial entries yield outside ashi with fragile control:
      - Attacker re-threads legs inside as the opponent turns in.
      - Uses that movement to establish single or cross ashi with stronger knee-line control.

- Dilemma-driven switching
  - Primary vs secondary leg:
    - If the opponent over-defends the primary leg:
      - Attacker switches focus to the secondary leg with toe holds or heel hooks.
    - When the secondary leg is unprotected:
      - Leg lace and double heel hook patterns become available.
  - Grip and wedge adjustments:
    - Changes in grip (e.g. Achilles to heel, heel to toe hold) are tied to changes in leg configuration, not random choices.

- Training perspective
  - Transition chains are drilled as:
    - Pre-set flows that respond to specific defences (turnout, spin, crossover, standing).
    - Progressive chains where each link has clear control criteria (inside position, knee line, heel exposure).
  - Goal:
    - Ensure attackers think in terms of families and pathways rather than isolated one-step finishes.

- System emphasis
  - The system’s real strength appears in these chains:
    - Ability to move from one family to another while keeping the opponent inside a continuous thread of threats.
  - A successful application scenario is defined by:
    - Maintenance of structural principles (inside position, knee line, wedges).
    - Smooth transitions that turn every defensive action into a new attacking opportunity.

      - From entanglement, repeatedly:
        - Pummel legs to regain inside when lost.
        - Switch ashi families when the opponent forces outside configurations.

  - Heel exposure and gripping
    - Exposing the heel:
      - Use push–pull and tilt mechanics to:

====================================
ANNEX A: EXTRACTED KEY PASSAGES
====================================


A.1 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND PHILOSOPHY
--------------------------------------

- Leg locks are treated as a complete subsystem within jiu-jitsu, with its own structure, rather than a loose collection of tricks.
- The overall jiu-jitsu game is the “general system”; the leg lock game is a subsystem that must integrate smoothly with takedowns, guard, passing, pins, and upper-body submissions.
- The focus is not on “all leg locks” in the abstract, but on a carefully chosen subset of high-percentage ashi-based leg locks that justify systematic study.
- The aim is to build a leg lock system that can accommodate resistance at the highest levels of competition, not just create quick wins against unprepared opponents.
- Progress is organised around a finite set of essential skills for heel hooking, giving a clear checklist that runs from first contact to final break.


A.2 WEDGES, DEMARCATION LINES, AND APPROACHING THE OPPONENT
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Wedges are identified as the primary means of immobilisation in grappling: inclined planes created by the limbs and body that trap and control segments of the opponent.
- Conventional pins rely heavily on bodyweight, but leg entanglements rely far more on correctly placed wedges reinforced by biomechanics.
- Effective leg locking requires wedges on both sides of the opponent’s body; without dual-sided control, the opponent will simply move out of danger.
- Approaching a seated or supine opponent is inherently dangerous if done naively, because the attacker crosses into the opponent’s prime attacking zone.
- Distance is structured around clear demarcation lines: toe line, knee line, and deeper engagement; crossing each line without structure is treated as a serious strategic error.
- Entries past the toe or knee line are only acceptable when supported by proper grips and emerging inside position; simply stepping in is considered an invitation to be swept or leg locked.


A.3 INSIDE POSITION, KNEE LINE, AND CONTROL HIERARCHY
-----------------------------------------------------

- Inside position with the legs is a central theme: having the attacking legs inside the opponent’s legs creates superior leverage and transition options.
- Inside position is not a one-time achievement; it is an ongoing fight in every exchange, similar to hand fighting for inside grips on the upper body.
- Without inside leg position, attempted entries are framed as structurally weak and far more likely to fail against experienced opposition.
- Control of the knee line is explicitly separated from mere control of the foot or ankle; a trapped foot without a controlled knee line is treated as poor positional value.
- Effective leg control is defined by keeping the opponent’s knee line locked within the frame of the attacker’s hips and thighs; once the knee line slides free, the position is essentially lost.
- Positions are ranked by a leg-control hierarchy: stronger positions trap hip and knee together and offer multiple attack paths; weaker positions offer only momentary control or a single threat.


A.4 ASHI FAMILIES, SHARED SPIRAL, AND CYCLES
--------------------------------------------

- The leg lock game is organised around a small number of recurring ashi families (single, double, cross, irimi, reverse, outside, lace variants), each defined by specific hip, knee, and foot alignments.
- Each major family is treated as a subsystem with characteristic entries, defences, and counters, and competence requires fluency in more than one family.
- Straight-style entanglements are acknowledged as structurally vulnerable to the “shared spiral” problem: the same spiral that generates breaking force also provides the opponent’s escape route.
- In a shared spiral, attacker and defender spin along the same path; if uncontrolled, this often leads to long rolls with no decisive outcome.
- The response to shared spiral is to break the shared axis by changing entanglement (for example, shifting from straight configurations to cross or reverse ashi) or by adding additional wedges via multiple-leg control.
- Inside–outside leg dominance is treated as cyclical; every exchange shifts the inside/outside relationship, and specific pummelling and transition patterns are used to regain or exploit inside control.


A.5 BREAKING MECHANICS, RESISTANCE, AND FOLLOW-THROUGH
------------------------------------------------------

- High-percentage breaking mechanics start with proper heel or foot capture, but they cannot succeed consistently without prior slack removal and structural tightening.
- Slack removal is treated as a distinct phase: wedges at hip, thigh, and ankle are adjusted until there is minimal movement between grip, joint, and attacker’s torso.
- Negating resistance means denying the opponent the ability to move in the direction of applied force; any ability to freely follow the direction of the lock is identified as a major flaw in the setup.
- Inside and outside heel hooks are framed as extremely powerful yet controllable submissions when entered with correct alignment and progressive, rather than explosive, loading.
- Breaking attempts are not single events; every failed or defended attempt should flow into another submission, a transition to a different entanglement, or a positional improvement.
- A successful system is one in which there is almost no “dead time” after an initial attempt; the attacker either finishes or immediately flows into the next stage of the decision tree.


A.6 CENTRAL PROBLEMS, DILEMMAS, AND SECONDARY ATTACKS
-----------------------------------------------------

- The leg lock system is built around a set of central recurring problems: untying defensive leg configurations, dealing with spins and crossovers, and finishing under non-optimal alignment.
- Defensive behaviours such as crossing or triangling the legs are expected and are treated as standard problems to be solved, not as rare exceptions.
- When a secondary leg is used to shield the primary leg, that secondary leg is explicitly re-framed as a new attack target (for example, figure-four toe holds or other secondary submissions).
- Attacking the leg that performs the defensive task creates dilemmas: defending the primary leg exposes the secondary, and defending the secondary leg often re-opens the primary target.
- Double heel hook and dual-leg control scenarios are explained as extreme versions of the dilemma principle, where any serious defence of one heel leaves the other badly compromised.
- The preferred approach is always dilemma-based: any plausible defensive choice should keep the opponent inside the system and move them closer to either a submission or a major positional loss.


A.7 TRAINING, DRILLS, AND INDEPENDENT THINKING
----------------------------------------------

- The system emphasises structured drilling over casual sparring: connection, penetration, gravity, and rolling drills are used to normalise key movement patterns before heavy resistance is added.
- Leg pummelling is treated as a distinct skill analogous to hand fighting, with top and bottom players repeatedly cycling inside and outside leg positions under controlled conditions.
- Rolling drills are used to familiarise practitioners with following heel-hook-related spirals safely, maintaining control through direction changes rather than freezing or panicking mid-roll.
- Situational sparring is stressed: rounds start from specific leg-lock-relevant scenarios (standing vs seated, deep ashi with partial escapes, crossed-leg defences) to force direct application of the system.
- Independent thinking is highlighted as an explicit goal: students should be able to diagnose why attacks fail in terms of missing elements (grip, wedge, inside position, knee line, spiral control) and construct adjustments without relying on memorised sequences.
- Long-term development is framed as moving from copying techniques to reasoning in terms of system principles, so new problems can be solved by reference to the same underlying concepts.


================================
ANNEX B: TERMINOLOGY
================================


B.1 POSITIONAL AND FAMILY TERMS
-------------------------------

- Ashi garami
  - Generic term for leg-entanglement positions where one or both of the attacker’s legs are wrapped around one of the opponent’s legs.
  - Emphasises using the legs as wedges to immobilise the opponent’s hip and knee, not just loosely hooking.

- Single leg ashi
  - Ashi configuration focused on one of the opponent’s legs, with the attacker’s legs clamping that leg and trapping the knee line between the thighs.
  - Commonly used as a primary entry hub and launching point for transitions to stronger entanglements or finishes.

- Double leg ashi
  - Configuration where both of the opponent’s legs are controlled simultaneously between or around the attacker’s legs.
  - Reduces base and mobility and can feed into ankle lace, double heel hook, or transitions to focused control on one leg.

- Cross ashi
  - Entanglement where the opponent’s knee is pinned across the attacker’s belt line and clamped between the thighs, with the opponent’s foot projecting to the opposite side of the attacker’s torso.
  - Favoured position for inside heel hook mechanics and a central hub for transitions to reverse and other ashi families.

- Irimi ashi
  - Deep-entering ashi configuration where the attacker’s leg penetrates between the opponent’s legs, bringing hips very close to the opponent’s hip line.
  - Used to reassert control and knee-line dominance when distance has opened or the opponent is backing away.

- Reverse ashi
  - Variation where the attacker’s torso is oriented away from the opponent, with the opponent’s leg trapped between the attacker’s legs from a reversed angle.
  - Often arises from following defensive spins; provides strong breaking options along the reverse rotational line.

- Outside ashi
  - Ashi configuration with the attacker’s legs on the outside of the opponent’s leg, usually facing the opponent’s outer line rather than the centre.
  - Offers quick outside heel hook access but generally weaker knee-line control than inside-based families.

- Ankle lace ashi
  - Double-leg style control where both of the opponent’s ankles are bound together using the attacker’s arms and/or legs.
  - Strong base-breaking configuration that can lead to sweeps, double heel hooks, or transitions into more focused ashi.

- X guard
  - Guard position where the attacker’s feet form an “X” configuration around one of the opponent’s legs while the attacker is underneath.
  - Used to off-balance and elevate the opponent, then convert into ashi garami as the leg becomes exposed.

- Reverse X guard
  - Inverted version of X guard, with the attacker’s hips and legs arranged to lift and rotate the opponent from a different angle.
  - Particularly effective for feeding the opponent’s leg into cross ashi or single leg ashi as they are tilted.

- Double seated position
  - Scenario where both players are seated facing each other with legs forward and no established top/bottom.
  - Treated as a battle for inside leg position and grips that determines who secures the first entanglement.


B.2 CONTROL, WEDGE, AND GRIP TERMS
----------------------------------

- Wedge
  - Any limb or body segment used as an inclined plane to block and trap part of the opponent’s body.
  - Central to leg entanglements, where wedges at hip, thigh, and ankle fix the leg so applied force goes directly into the joint.

- Inside position (legs)
  - Condition where the attacker’s legs are threaded inside the opponent’s legs rather than outside them.
  - Provides superior control, transition options, and access to the knee line; treated as a constant battle in all exchanges.

- Two-on-one grip
  - Grip configuration where both of the attacker’s hands control one of the opponent’s limbs (arm, shin, ankle) instead of splitting attention across two limbs.
  - Used to dominate the targeted limb, break stance, and guide it into entanglements.

- Immovable elbow
  - Principle of anchoring the gripping elbow to the attacker’s own torso (hip or ribs) so the whole body supports the grip.
  - Prevents the opponent from easily prying or dragging the grip away and transfers force from hips and core, not just the arm.

- Scoop grip
  - Grip that threads under the opponent’s heel or ankle and lifts it into the attacker’s hip line.
  - Used in conjunction with shin-to-shin to elevate, turn, and isolate the leg for entries.

- Shin-to-shin
  - Seated connection where the attacker’s shin is placed directly against the opponent’s shin, often with the foot hooking behind the opponent’s calf.
  - Provides close-range control and a strong platform for sweeps or immediate ashi entries.

- Hand-over-shoulder control
  - Torso control where the attacker’s arm wraps over the opponent’s shoulder and clamps behind their back or lat.
  - Links upper body to lower body control, limiting the opponent’s ability to spin or posture out of entanglements.

- Collar-and-heel (or collar-and-ankle) control
  - Combined grip where one hand controls near the head/upper body (collar-style) and the other controls the heel or ankle.
  - Enables strong push–pull mechanics that compromise stance and expose the leg.

- Over–under method (grip)
  - Control where one arm goes over and one arm goes under the opponent’s limb(s), encircling them.
  - Creates strong encirclement for maintaining heel or ankle control during heavy hand-fighting.

- Double elbow control
  - Configuration where both elbows are tight to the attacker’s body with the opponent’s limb trapped between forearms and chest.
  - Produces a powerful, low-effort frame that stabilises heel or foot control against defensive hand-fighting.

- Splitter hand
  - Use of the hand as a wedge between the opponent’s limbs to separate crossed, triangled, or tightly connected legs or arms.
  - Key tool in untying defensive leg configurations that hide heels.

- Elbow slicer (control use)
  - Use of the forearm or elbow against a bent limb to create painful pressure and leverage.
  - Applied primarily as a control tool to force the opponent to open stubborn ties, not as a primary submission focus in this context.


B.3 MECHANICAL AND CONCEPTUAL TERMS
-----------------------------------

- Demarcation lines (toe line, knee line)
  - Imaginary lines used to structure distance:
    - Toe line: distance where feet can begin to meaningfully engage.
    - Knee line: deeper distance where the attacker’s hips are near the opponent’s knees.
  - Crossing these lines without structure is considered strategically unsound.

- Knee line
  - Conceptual line across the opponent’s leg at knee level used to judge whether the leg is truly captured inside the entanglement.
  - If the knee line is trapped between the attacker’s hips/thighs, strong control exists; if it escapes, control is largely lost.

- Primary leg
  - The opponent’s leg that is currently the main submission target in a given entanglement.
  - Typically the leg whose heel, ankle, or knee line is best aligned with the attacker’s control and breaking mechanics.

- Secondary leg
  - The opponent’s other leg, used by the attacker to break base, add control, or form a second submission threat.
  - Frequently becomes the focus of dilemmas when it is used to shield the primary leg.

- Shared spiral problem
  - Structural issue in straight-style entanglements where attacker and defender share the same rotational axis around the leg.
  - Enables the defender to roll along the line of applied force, often diffusing pressure and facilitating escape if not managed.

- Inside–outside dominance (legs)
  - Ongoing battle over whether the attacker’s legs or the opponent’s legs control the inside channels between the hips.
  - Cycles of dominance occur as legs pummel in and out; system responses include transitions between ashi families and re-pummelling.

- Turnout problem
  - Defensive behaviour where the opponent rotates hips and body away from the entanglement to remove heel exposure and begin freeing the knee line.
  - Must be anticipated and either blocked or turned into transitions to new entanglements.

- Release problem
  - Defensive effort by the opponent to break a key part of the entanglement: peeling grips, opening crossed feet, or slipping hips away.
  - Managing the release means anticipating which structural element the opponent will attack and preparing grip or positional changes that punish that attempt.

- Untying legs
  - Process of dismantling crossed, triangled, or otherwise knotted defensive leg structures that protect the primary leg.
  - Uses splitter hand, wedges, and toe-hold-based threats to open the configuration and re-expose the primary or secondary leg.

- Dilemma attack
  - Structured attack where any realistic defensive choice leads to an equally or more dangerous threat.
  - Typical examples include:
    - Primary vs secondary leg breaks.
    - Heel hook vs toe hold vs Achilles sequences.
    - Toe hold on the leg that is shielding the primary heel.

- Slack removal
  - Phase where extra movement between the attacker’s grip, the opponent’s joint, and the attacker’s torso is eliminated.
  - Achieved by tightening wedges, adjusting grip depth, and aligning hips/torso so breaking force goes directly into the joint.


B.4 BREAKING, SUBMISSION, AND DEFENCE TERMS
-------------------------------------------

- Inside heel hook
  - Rotational submission targeting the inside of the opponent’s knee, with the heel captured on the inside of the leg.
  - Typically favoured from inside-dominant entanglements such as cross ashi, with strict attention to knee-line control and rotational direction.

- Outside heel hook
  - Rotational submission targeting the outside of the opponent’s knee, with the heel captured on the outside of the leg.
  - Often arises from outside ashi or related positions and requires careful management of knee-line control due to higher escape risk.

- Achilles lock (straight ankle lock)
  - Submission focusing on the Achilles tendon and ankle joint via fulcrum under the Achilles and extension through the foot.
  - Alternative grip variations and improved fulcrum use are emphasised to turn “soft” locks into legitimate breaking threats.

- Figure four toe hold
  - Submission where the attacker forms a figure-four grip on the opponent’s foot, using the hand and wrist as a lever against the toes.
  - Functions both as a primary finish and, crucially, as a way to attack the leg that is shielding the primary target.

- Double heel hook
  - Configuration where both of the opponent’s heels are under simultaneous or rapidly alternating attack.
  - Creates powerful dilemmas, as defending one heel typically exposes the other.

- Dilemma (breaking context)
  - General term for situations where the opponent must choose between two or more dangerous outcomes:
    - For example, saving the primary heel at the cost of exposing the secondary heel or toe.
  - The system deliberately aims to build such structures rather than single-threat positions.

- Defensive spin
  - Rolling movement used by the opponent to follow the direction of heel-hook torque and reduce stress on the knee.
  - If uncontrolled, spins can lead to escapes; if followed correctly, they can lead into cross ashi, reverse ashi, or other stronger entanglements.

- Leg crossover (dynamic and static)
  - Defensive configuration where the opponent crosses legs rapidly (dynamic) or locks them (static) to protect a targeted heel.
  - Treated as a standard defensive shell to be dismantled via untying mechanics and secondary attacks such as toe holds.


B.5 ENTRY, MOVEMENT, AND DRILL TERMS
------------------------------------

- Sitback
  - Entry mechanic where the attacker controls the opponent’s leg and sits back to the mat, bringing the leg into ashi.
  - Proper sitback keeps hips close to the opponent’s hip and knee line; falling away and leaving space is discouraged.

- Sliding ashi
  - Entry pattern where the attacker slides hips under or along the opponent’s leg rather than stepping in from distance.
  - Maintains continuous contact and shortens the hip–knee distance at the moment entanglement is closed.

- Kani basami
  - Scissoring-style entry where the attacker’s legs cut across the opponent’s thigh and lower leg to bring them down and establish deep entanglement.
  - High-commitment entry that must land directly into a strong ashi configuration to be effective and safe.

- Elevator (bottom single elevator / crossed-feet single elevator)
  - Guard structure where a hook under the opponent’s leg lifts and tilts them.
  - Used to create sweeps or direct entries into ashi; crossed-feet variations increase clamp strength on the thigh.

- Movement inside (drill concept)
  - Drill and concept focusing on repeatedly threading legs to the inside and managing angle changes to maintain inside position.
  - Forms the basis of leg pummelling for both bottom and top players.

- Connection drills
  - Partner drills designed to maintain continuous attachment (grips and leg contact) to the opponent’s leg as they move.
  - Train the ability to adjust hips, grips, and angles without losing the leg.

- Penetration drills
  - Drills that take the attacker from outside engagement range to entanglement in structured steps.
  - Emphasise crossing demarcation lines only with proper grips and inside position emerging.

- Gravity drills
  - Drills focusing on posture, base reactions, and angle management as bodyweight shifts.
  - Prepare the body for controlled sitbacks, falls, and angle changes that occur during entries and finishes.

- Double leg roll
  - Rolling movement from double leg entanglements where attacker and defender may travel in arcs or full rotations.
  - Trains maintenance of knee-line and heel control through rolling transitions.

- Rolling transition (straight to cross ashi)
  - Specific rolling sequence where the attacker follows the defender’s spin from straight-style ashi and lands in cross ashi with improved alignment.
  - Key to converting shared spiral movement into positional upgrades rather than escapes.


B.6 STRATEGIC AND TRAINING-FOCUS TERMS
--------------------------------------

- Leg lock subsystem
  - The integrated collection of leg control, entries, entanglements, and breaks that plug into the wider jiu-jitsu game.
  - Designed to coexist with and reinforce guard, passing, and back-taking systems rather than replace them.

- Central problems
  - Recurring structural difficulties that the system explicitly addresses:
    - Shared spiral.
    - Turnout.
    - Release and untying problems.
    - Non-optimal finishing conditions.
  - Training is organised to solve these problems predictably, not sporadically.

- Dilemma-based approach
  - Strategic framework that prioritises positions where every defensive reaction leads to a new, equally significant threat.
  - Drives the choice of grips, entanglements, and transitions, especially around primary/secondary leg interactions.

- Follow-through
  - Principle that no submission attempt ends with a single action.
  - Every attempt either completes the break or flows directly into another submission, transition, or positional upgrade.

- Independent thinking (system-level reasoning)
  - Expectation that practitioners analyse failures in terms of system components:
    - Grip quality.
    - Inside position.
    - Knee-line control.
    - Spiral management.
    - Wedge placement and slack.
  - Ultimately, decisions in live exchanges are guided by these concepts rather than fixed technique lists.


================================
ANNEX C: ADDITIONAL NOTES
================================


C.1 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN LOGIC
----------------------------------------

- Subsystem within broader grappling game
  - Leg locks are framed as one subsystem among several:
    - Standing and takedowns.
    - Guard and sweeps.
    - Passing and top pins.
    - Back takes and upper-body submissions.
  - The leg subsystem is designed to plug into and out of these other areas without creating contradictions in posture, base, or grip behaviour.

- Design around a limited, high-yield set
  - Emphasis is placed on a relatively small family of high-percentage leg entanglements and submissions.
  - Many potential leg-lock positions are de-emphasised if they:
    - Do not scale under resistance.
    - Require unusual body types.
    - Contradict fundamental posture and wedge principles.
  - The result is a narrow but deep system that can be applied under intense pressure.

- Hierarchical structure vs technique list
  - The system is explicitly hierarchical:
    - Concepts (wedges, inside position, knee line) at the top.
    - Positional families (ashi variants) in the middle.
    - Specific grips, entries, and finishes at the bottom.
  - This hierarchy ensures that new techniques can be understood and evaluated by how well they obey higher-level principles.

- Continuous paths between subsystems
  - Leg entanglements are integrated into common transitions:
    - Guard → leg entanglement → sweep → top control.
    - Standing → leg entanglement → finish or clinch re-entry.
    - Half guard → leg entanglement or passing, depending on reactions.
  - Movement between subsystems is treated as routine, not exceptional; the same structural rules apply across contexts.


C.2 STUDY STRATEGY AND PROGRESSION
----------------------------------

- Concept-first approach
  - Study is encouraged to begin with:
    - Understanding inside position and knee-line control.
    - Recognising wedges and demarcation lines.
    - Seeing ashi families as control positions rather than “submission spots”.
  - Once these concepts are clear, techniques and entries are easier to classify and retain.

- Volume-by-volume progression logic
  - Early material concentrates on:
    - Grips, inside position, and basic entanglements.
    - Simple entries and knee-line awareness.
  - Middle material emphasises:
    - Ashi family interactions.
    - Shared spiral, central problems, and cycles of dominance.
    - Breaking mechanics and follow-through.
  - Later material integrates:
    - Advanced entries across standing, guard, half guard, and double seated.
    - Complex dilemmas using primary/secondary legs and dual-leg control.

- Role of drilling vs sparring
  - Drilling is positioned as the primary engine of technical development:
    - Repetition of movement-inside patterns.
    - Structured connection and penetration drills.
    - Gravity and rolling drills for finishing mechanics.
  - Sparring, especially situational sparring, is used to:
    - Pressure-test concepts.
    - Reveal where in the decision tree failure occurs.
  - Free rolling without structured emphasis is seen as insufficient to build a robust leg lock system.

- Focused cycles
  - Training is recommended in cycles that emphasise:
    - A particular ashi family.
    - A specific central problem (e.g. spins, crossovers, turnout).
    - A set of entry scenarios (e.g. standing vs seated, half guard, double seated).
  - Each cycle revisits fundamental concepts so that improvements in one area reinforce the rest of the system.


C.3 INTEGRATION WITH OTHER POSITIONAL SYSTEMS
---------------------------------------------

- Guard systems
  - Existing guard structures are not abandoned when pursuing leg locks:
    - De La Riva, knee shield, X and reverse X guard are reinterpreted as launchpads into leg entanglements.
    - Sweeps and stand-ups remain valid outcomes; leg attacks are added, not substituted.
  - Guard players are encouraged to:
    - Maintain strong frames and off-balancing principles.
    - Add leg-entry options only when balance is already broken.

- Passing and top systems
  - Top players are taught to connect:
    - Leg pummelling and irimi-style entries.
    - Standard passing routes (knee cut, body lock, backstep) and leg-entanglement opportunities.
  - When passing pressure creates stretched, isolated legs:
    - That same extension is reframed as an entry moment for ashi.
  - Conversely, leg-entry attempts that fail should revert back into strong passing posture, not scramble-based exchanges.

- Back attack and upper-body submissions
  - Leg entanglements frequently open:
    - Back exposure when opponents turn excessively to escape.
    - Upper-body submission entries when opponents sit up into guillotine- or headlock-style openings.
  - Training is structured so the leg subsystem:
    - Provides routes to back and upper-body attacks.
    - Does not become an end in itself divorced from positional advancement.

- Positional priority
  - System logic keeps positional value in view:
    - A clean break ends the fight.
    - If the break is not available, sweeping to dominant top positions is strongly preferred over loose scrambles.
    - Leg entanglements without meaningful control are actively discouraged.


C.4 COACHING EMPHASES AND COMMON TRAPS
--------------------------------------

- Emphasis on structure before submission
  - Strong repetition on:
    - Grips that connect the limb to the torso.
    - Hips close to the knee line.
    - Feet and knees as wedges rather than passive hooks.
  - Submission attempts are delayed until structure is demonstrably sound; “submission first, structure later” is treated as a common error.

- Clear red flags
  - Several behaviours are repeatedly called out as traps:
    - Throwing the body backwards away from the opponent during sitbacks.
    - Diving at the legs without grips or inside position.
    - Chasing exposed feet while the knee line is clearly escaping.
    - Accepting shared-spiral rolls without plan or control.
  - Practitioners are encouraged to treat these as automatic “stop and reset” signals.

- Defensive overconfidence
  - Over-reliance on:
    - Spinning without awareness of where the leg will land.
    - Crossing legs as a universal shield.
    - Standing up without addressing grips and wedges.
  - These habits are framed as dangerous against a system that anticipates and punishes such defences with toe holds, secondary attacks, and transitions.

- Attacker overcommitment
  - Attacking players are warned against:
    - Forcing entries when distance and posture are wrong.
    - Clinging to poor entanglements instead of exiting and re-entering.
    - Ignoring opportunities to sweep or take the back in favour of low-percentage leg shots.
  - The system values clean entries and solid control more than constant leg hunting.

- Safety culture
  - Due to the severity of heel hooks and toe holds:
    - Emphasis is placed on controlled loading and early tapping norms.
    - Partners are encouraged to communicate openly about thresholds.
    - Drills and situational rounds involving deep entanglements are scaled in intensity according to experience level.


C.5 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES AND LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------------------------

- Building recognition before speed
  - Initial goal is the ability to recognise:
    - When inside position is won or lost.
    - Whether the knee line is captured or escaping.
    - Which ashi family is currently in play.
    - How the opponent is using the secondary leg (shielding vs inactive).
  - Only once recognition is reliable under light sparring should speed and explosiveness be increased.

- Decision-tree thinking
  - Practitioners are encouraged to think in terms of:
    - “If–then” branches:
      - If the opponent turns out → which transition?
      - If the opponent crosses legs → which untying sequence and secondary attack?
      - If the knee line is half-escaped → which re-capture or family switch?
  - Over time, this decision tree becomes intuitive, but early on it is studied consciously and rehearsed in drills.

- Feedback loops
  - Training sessions are expected to end with:
    - Short reviews of where in the chain failure occurred:
      - Entry timing.
      - Inside position battles.
      - Knee-line awareness.
      - Spiral control.
      - Breaking mechanics or follow-through.
    - Adjustments to upcoming sessions based on these observations.
  - This creates a continuous feedback loop between conceptual study, drilling, and live application.

- Balancing specialisation and general development
  - While the leg subsystem is developed in depth, it is repeatedly emphasised that:
    - Core positional skills (guard retention, passing, back control) must progress in parallel.
    - Leg lock training should enhance, not replace, overall grappling ability.
  - Long-term development is framed as:
    - A unified grappling style where leg attacks are a natural extension of positional dominance and conceptual clarity.

- Knee-line gate
  - Knee-line capture:
    - Knee line between attacker’s hips/thighs, not slipping past.
  - Without capture:
    - Leg grabs are treated as temporary; returning to structure is preferred over forcing submissions.
- Ashi build
  - Only after knee-line capture:
    - Choose which ashi family to build.

- Single leg ashi
  - Primary entry hub from shin-to-shin, sliding ashi, many sitbacks.
  - Transitions:
    - To double when second leg joins.
    - To cross when the leg is drawn across the belt line.
- Double leg ashi
  - Double-leg and ankle lace style entries.
  - Transitions:
    - To single as primary leg is selected.
    - To cross or outside when legs separate or rotate.
- Outside ashi
  - Frequently an early or emergency configuration after fast entries.
  - Often converted:
    - Into cross ashi when opponent turns in.
- Cross ashi
  - Central finishing hub for inside heel hooks.
  - Transitions:
    - To reverse ashi when spins continue.
- Reverse ashi
  - Developed from following spins from cross or straight-style ashi.
  - Can re-route:
    - Back into cross.
    - Into irimi if distance opens.
- Irimi ashi
  - Deep re-penetration when range increases.
  - Used to rebuild knee-line capture before re-entering other families.

- Turnout
  - Opponent rotates away to hide heel and clear hip.
  - Responses:
    - Angle change into cross or reverse ashi.
    - Use turnout to set toe holds or secondary-leg attacks.
- Spin / roll
  - Defensive spin along heel-hook line.
  - Responses:
    - Follow the spiral with shoulder and hip rotation.
    - Convert straight-style ashi into cross or reverse along the roll.
- Crossed or triangled legs
  - Secondary leg shields primary leg.
  - Responses:
    - Splitter hand and elbow slicer to open.
    - Figure-four toe holds and secondary leg attacks.
    - Once opened, return to primary heel or switch target.
- Knee-line near escape
  - Knee sliding towards edge of hip frame.
  - Responses:
    - Immediate hip and foot blocks.
    - Re-thread inside legs to drag knee back in.
    - If fully lost, exit and re-enter instead of forcing late submissions.

- Grip acquisition
  - Heel hooks:
    - Deep heel pocket, forearm + torso clamp.
  - Toe holds:
    - Long lever from toes, pinky knuckle at little toe joint.
  - Achilles grips:
    - Hard fulcrum under tendon with alternative grip options.
- Slack removal
  - Tighten wedges around hip, thigh, and ankle.
  - Shorten distance between grip and attacker’s core.
- Alignment
  - Inside heel hook:
    - Inward knee rotation; hips and torso aligned with medial structures.
  - Outside heel hook:
    - Outward knee rotation; more fragile knee-line control, more emphasis on wedges.
  - Toe hold/Achilles:
    - Align body so rotational or extension force goes directly into joint.
- Breaking load
  - Gradual, controlled torque increase.
  - Training culture emphasises early tap and communication.
- Dilemma node
  - If break is not taken or heavily defended:
    - Switch from primary to secondary leg.
    - Switch submission type (heel → toe hold → Achilles).
    - Sweep or stand into top while maintaining leg control.

- Concepts
  - Inside leg position, wedges, demarcation lines.
  - Knee-line hierarchy, shared spiral, central problems.
  - Primary/secondary leg and dilemma thinking.
- Isolated drills
  - Solo:
    - Movement inside, sitback, inversion, gravity and rolling patterns.
  - Partner:
    - Connection, penetration, leg pummelling, double leg roll, untying legs.
- Technical rounds
  - Complexes linking:
    - Entries → ashi build → heel/toe/Achilles threats → exits.
  - Service of building smooth, controlled chains, not ad hoc scrambles.
- Situational sparring
  - Standing vs seated, guard-based, half guard, double seated, deep-entanglement starts.
- Free sparring with constraints
  - Normal rounds but:
    - Emphasis on system rules: inside first, knee line before finish, follow spiral, maintain dilemmas.
- Review & adjust
  - After sessions:
    - Identify where chains fail (entry, control, finish, transitions).
    - Redirect drilling to those nodes for the next cycle.
    
====================================
ANNEX E: COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS
====================================


E.1 ENTERING WITHOUT INSIDE POSITION
------------------------------------

- Description
  - Attacker steps or sits into range for leg attacks while
    both legs remain outside the opponent’s legs.
  - Entries are launched from distance or off-balance, with
    no meaningful inside leg contact.

- Underlying causes
  - Misunderstanding of inside position as “optional” rather
    than the primary structural requirement.
  - Impatience: attacker dives on the leg at the first sight
    of a foot instead of building structure.
  - Over-focusing on grips while neglecting leg pummelling.

- Corrective strategies
  - Enforce rule: no deep entry unless at least one leg is
    clearly inside and building towards an inside-dominant
    configuration.
  - Drill “movement inside” and top/bottom leg pummelling as
    stand-alone skills before adding submissions.
  - In situational rounds, immediately reset whenever an
    entry starts with both attacker’s legs outside.


E.2 CROSSING DEMARCATION LINES WITHOUT STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------

- Description
  - Attacker walks or steps past the toe line and knee line
    with upright posture and little connection.
  - Opponent easily off-balances, underhooks, or counter-
    attacks the entering leg.

- Underlying causes
  - Lack of awareness of toe and knee lines as strategic
    boundaries.
  - Over-emphasis on “closing distance” instead of closing
    distance with grips and wedges.
  - Confusing passing footwork with leg-entry footwork.

- Corrective strategies
  - Require: grips first, then inside legs, then crossing
    the toe/knee line.
  - Use penetration drills where crossing the knee line
    without proper grips/inside position triggers an
    automatic loss/reset.
  - Connect standing entries to specific grip sequences
    (collar-and-heel, 2-on-1, scoop) so entry steps are
    always supported.


E.3 SHALLOW OR LOST KNEE-LINE CONTROL
-------------------------------------

- Description
  - Attacker “has the foot” but the opponent’s knee line is
    already sliding past the attacker’s hips.
  - Finishing attempts are applied while the knee is nearly
    or fully free.

- Underlying causes
  - Failure to distinguish between controlling the foot and
    controlling the knee line.
  - Late recognition of escape: attacker only notices when
    the leg is almost completely out.
  - Hips too far from the opponent’s hip line during entry
    and entanglement building.

- Corrective strategies
  - Build knee-line checks into every phase: entry, settle,
    and finish.
  - In drilling, stop and re-set any sequence where the
    attacker persists in finishing with a clearly escaped
    knee line.
  - Emphasise hip-closing and thigh-clamping drills that
    place the knee line firmly between the attacker’s hips
    before any submission is attempted.


E.4 CHASING FEET INSTEAD OF WEDGES AND HEEL EXPOSURE
----------------------------------------------------

- Description
  - Attacker repeatedly grabs at ankles or feet with long
    arms while the opponent’s hips and knees move freely.
  - Submissions are attempted from stretched-out positions,
    without proper wedges or heel exposure.

- Underlying causes
  - Foot-centric mindset: treating the ankle or heel as an
    isolated target unrelated to hip and knee control.
  - Reaching with arms instead of moving the hips underneath
    the leg.
  - Lack of slack-removal habits before applying force.

- Corrective strategies
  - Reframe: submissions are applied to a leg that is
    already immobilised by wedges; the foot is only the end
    of that structure.
  - Use drills where the attacker must first:
    - Clamp the knee line.
    - Build wedges at hip and thigh.
    - Only then secure the heel.
  - Penalise extended-arm, hip-far finishes in sparring by
    calling immediate positional losses when seen.


E.5 IGNORING THE SECONDARY LEG AND BASE
---------------------------------------

- Description
  - Attacker fixates on the primary leg while the secondary
    leg:
    - Posts.
    - Kicks.
    - Shields the primary leg.
    - Helps the opponent stand or spin free.

- Underlying causes
  - Viewing entanglements as one-leg positions instead of
    dual-leg systems.
  - Lack of understanding of primary vs secondary leg roles.
  - Failure to connect secondary leg control to sweeps and
    dilemma attacks.

- Corrective strategies
  - Explicitly label legs in training: primary vs secondary
    in every entanglement drill.
  - Add phases where the sole task is to:
    - Control or lace the secondary leg.
    - Break its base function (post/step).
  - Integrate figure-four toe holds, double heel hooks, and
    lace configurations so the secondary leg becomes an
    immediate threat, not an afterthought.


E.6 UNCONTROLLED SHARED SPIRAL AND OVER-ROLLING
-----------------------------------------------

- Description
  - From straight-style entanglements, attacker and opponent
    roll in long spirals with neither gaining decisive
    advantage.
  - Attacker loses heel exposure or knee-line control mid-
    roll and continues spinning without adjustment.

- Underlying causes
  - Failure to recognise shared spiral as a structural
    problem rather than “just how heel hooks work”.
  - Rolling purely reactively with the opponent instead of
    directing the spiral.
  - Lack of mapped transitions from straight to cross or
    reverse ashi during rotations.

- Corrective strategies
  - Train specific sequences:
    - Straight → cross ashi on the first roll.
    - Cross → reverse ashi when spiral continues.
  - Use gravity and rolling drills where the roll stops
    every quarter-turn to check:
    - Heel exposure.
    - Knee-line position.
    - Inside/outside leg status.
  - Emphasise early conversion from shared-spiral positions
    into multi-ashi or cross/reverse configurations that
    break the shared axis.


E.7 RUSHED BREAKING WITHOUT SLACK REMOVAL
-----------------------------------------

- Description
  - Attacker grabs a heel or foot and immediately cranks,
    often with large, sudden motions.
  - Force is applied through a loose structure; opponent
    rolls with pressure or endures without tapping.

- Underlying causes
  - Treating heel hooks and toe holds as “quick catch”
    submissions instead of structured breaks.
  - Lack of awareness of slack in the chain between grip,
    joint, and attacker’s core.
  - Over-reliance on arm strength instead of hip and torso
    alignment.

- Corrective strategies
  - Segment finishing into explicit phases:
    - Grip.
    - Slack removal.
    - Hip/torso alignment.
    - Progressive load.
  - Drill slow-motion finishes where the attacker must hold
    each phase for a count before moving on.
  - In coaching cues, prioritise:
    - Knee-line and wedge tightening.
    - Small angle changes.
    - Only then gradual rotational force.


E.8 ONE-AND-DONE ATTACKS (NO FOLLOW-THROUGH)
--------------------------------------------

- Description
  - Attacker attempts a single heel hook or toe hold; once
    defended, they disengage or stall.
  - Exchanges are a series of isolated attempts rather than
    continuous chains.

- Underlying causes
  - Absence of a decision tree mapping defensive reactions
    to next options.
  - Over-focus on the initial submission instead of the
    underlying entanglement.
  - Mental “reset” whenever the first attack fails.

- Corrective strategies
  - Build attack chains into drilling:
    - Each submission attempt must be followed by:
      - A second submission.
      - Or a leg switch.
      - Or a sweep/positional upgrade.
  - Use technical rounds where the attacker is not allowed
    to disengage after the first defended attempt; they must
    continue chaining until:
    - A break.
    - A sweep.
    - Or a clear positional improvement occurs.
  - Continually reference the system flow:
    - From entanglement → dilemma → finish or transition,
      never single actions in isolation.


E.9 OVERCOMMITTING TO LEG LOCKS AT THE COST OF POSITION
-------------------------------------------------------

- Description
  - Attacker dives for legs from strong top or back-taking
    opportunities and loses dominant positions when entries
    fail.
  - Repeated patterns where passing or back exposure is
    sacrificed for low-percentage leg shots.

- Underlying causes
  - Viewing leg locks as inherently higher value than
    positional control.
  - Lack of integration between leg subsystem and passing/
    back systems.
  - Insufficient sensitivity to when the opponent’s posture
    and base already favour positional continuation.

- Corrective strategies
  - In positional training:
    - Enforce rules prioritising:
      - Maintaining mount/back.
      - Completing high-percentage passes.
      - Only dropping to legs when specific structural
        criteria are met (isolated leg, poor base, easy
        knee-line capture).
  - Run “choice drills”:
    - From positions where both pass/back and leg entries
      are available, attacker must:
      - Verbally identify why they pick one route.
      - Review outcomes after rounds to check if choices
        were justified.
  - Emphasise that leg attacks are a branch of positional
    dominance, not a replacement for it.


E.10 DEFENSIVE MISUSE: BLIND SPINS, CROSSOVERS, AND STAND-UPS
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Description
  - Defenders rely on:
    - Spinning without tracking where the leg will land.
    - Crossing legs reflexively as a shield.
    - Standing straight up while leaving grips and wedges
      intact.
  - These behaviours often move the defender deeper into
    dilemmas (toe holds, secondary-leg attacks, stronger
    ashi) rather than out of danger.

- Underlying causes
  - Over-generalised “spin to escape” and “cross legs to
    defend” habits.
  - Poor awareness of where the knee line, heel, and wedges
    are during movement.
  - Treating standing as inherently safe regardless of
    existing attachments.

- Corrective strategies
  - For defenders:
    - Study the structural goals of the attacker:
      - Knee-line escape first.
      - Then addressing grips and wedges.
    - Drill controlled spins where the aim is:
      - To place the leg in specific safe geometries.
      - Not simply to move.
    - Practise stand-ups that:
      - Peel grips.
      - Disengage wedges.
      - Keep the knee line clear on the way up.
  - For attackers:
    - Anticipate these behaviours and:
      - Tie spins to cross/reverse transitions.
      - Tie crossovers to toe holds and untying routines.
      - Tie poorly structured stand-ups to off-balancing
        and re-entries.
