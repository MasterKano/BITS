# ETS Leg Locks — Extractable Systems Overview

## How many “systems” are in this series?
You can reasonably extract **26 unified system pages** from this series without duplicating VN content.

This count assumes:
- “System” = durable, reusable pattern (position family, control principle, threshold, entry family, finish family, or decision-rule framework).
- We keep pages concise (purpose + key positions + cues + drills + errors), and avoid reprinting chapter-by-chapter notes.

## Recommended unified system map (26 pages)

### A) Core framework + control thresholds (8)
1. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/framework.md` — phases/gates model: inside → connection → knee line → heel exposure → resistance → break  
2. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/wedges.md` — wedges + wedge testing (hands-free diagnostics)  
3. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/inside-position.md` — inside track logic across standing/seated/supine  
4. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/ankle-line.md` — “ankle line” as entry boundary and success criterion  
5. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/knee-line.md` — knee-line control + recovery rules  
6. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/connection.md` — distance + connection (including gravity-testing logic)  
7. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/breaking-mechanics.md` — lever/fulcrum, toe-line vs heel, pre-tension concepts  
8. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/resistance-taxonomy.md` — structure break / rotate / knee-line escape: read → respond

### B) Ashi families (3)
9. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/ashi-straight.md` — irimi/straight-ashi family: primary structure, jobs of legs  
10. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/ashi-cross.md` — cross-ashi family: turnout problem + control responses  
11. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/ashi-reverse.md` — reverse-ashi/ushiro family: stability + gateway transitions

### C) Heel hook systems (2)
12. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/heel-hook-outside.md` — outside heel hook: opposing forces, grip demarcations, finish path  
13. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/heel-hook-inside.md` — inside heel hook: exposure-to-control sequencing + finish priorities

### D) Heel exposure + spiral control (4)
14. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/heel-exposure.md` — exposure as a standalone skill (inside-ashi platform, re-pinning heel)  
15. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/shared-spiral.md` — shared spiral problem and why classic finishes fail  
16. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/spiral-speed-control.md` — stopping/controlling spiral speed (shoulder roll mechanics)  
17. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/follow-through.md` — breaking arc tracking; knee-follows-knee; anti-run mechanics

### E) Cross-ashi “two-leg control” toolset (5)
18. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/ankle-lace.md` — ankle lace ashi: anti-turnout double-leg immobilization  
19. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/release-management.md` — release problem + grip/structure retention responses  
20. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/double-heel-dilemmas.md` — switching targets across two legs to punish peeling/defense  
21. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/two-feet-management.md` — splitter hand / double elbow / over-under as a unified “control toolkit”  
22. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/double-cross-controls.md` — stacked/crossed leg arrangements to constrain movement and enable switching

### F) Reverse-ashi knot solving + toe holds (2)
23. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/untie-legs.md` — tied-legs/triangle defense: centerline pull, “knot” solving  
24. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/toe-hold-figure-four.md` — figure-four toe hold mechanics + dilemma use (secondary then primary)

### G) Entry families (standing + grounded) (2)
25. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/entries-standing.md` — sitback, inside-out/outside-in, outside step-in, kani basami (lane + head position rules)  
26. `BITS/SYS/leglocks/entries-guard.md` — shin-to-shin, single elevator, X/reverse-X, inversion, knee shield paths, shoelace breakdown, double-seated pummeling

## Practical “v1” build (if you want the minimum set first)
If you only build **10 pages** initially, do these:
- framework, inside-position, ankle-line, knee-line, connection, heel-exposure, resistance-taxonomy,
- ashi-straight, heel-hook-outside, shared-spiral

Then expand into cross-ashi tools, reverse-ashi tools, toe holds, and entry families.

## Next command (to proceed cleanly)
Use: `System leglocks/framework` (then `System leglocks/inside-position`, etc.), and I’ll generate each unified page one at a time under `BITS/SYS/leglocks/`.
