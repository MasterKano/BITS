## 0.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- K Guard is treated as an attack platform that requires structural “gates” before rotation-based offense is attempted.
  - Primary gates repeatedly reinforced: off-balance to lift the knee off the mat; control connection (especially the scoop grip) to prevent leg stapling into half guard.

- Knee-off-the-mat is the early decisive battle for reliable K Guard offense.
  - If the knee stays planted/heavy, rotation and “going around” are delayed; space and off-balance are built first (including hip lift and knee-shield-style spacing when needed).

- Scoop grip is positioned as a non-negotiable control requirement.
  - Loss of scoop is treated as an immediate threat of collapse (opponent grabs/staples the leg and forces half guard); grip recovery is prioritized before attacking.

- The system routes into two primary lanes based on opponent orientation and denial.
  - Backside lane when the opponent turns away/runs and exposes backside access.
  - Frontside lane when backside hooks are denied (knee opened/behind-knee hook not available), requiring a specific facing/angle solution.

- Backside lane is hub-driven and reaction-tracking.
  - Backside 50/50 is a central hub feeding inside heel hook work, with consolidation options when entanglement becomes mirrored (double 50/50).
  - Common top reactions (backstep/high backstep) are treated as follow-triggers: maintain connection and arrive in the next best control rather than resetting.

- Backside lane includes secondary submission threats and back-exposure routes.
  - Reverse Aoki variations are presented as complementary threats alongside the inside-heel-hook pathway.
  - Matrix and X-hook sequences emphasize conditions: when the behind-knee hook/control is denied, forcing the entry is treated as low value and routing changes.

- Frontside lane is built around angle creation as the foundational requirement for outside leg locks.
  - Correct facing (same-direction alignment) is treated as a prerequisite; off-balancing forward/backward is used to stop the opponent stepping heavy and killing the position.
  - Aoki lock variations (including a belly-down completion pathway) and outside heel hook lines are chained from the aligned hub rather than treated as isolated moves.

- Threat cycling and branching are used to punish predictable defense.
  - Combining submissions together is presented as hub retention + line switching rather than reset-and-reenter.
  - Leg switch creates a dilemma: one branch improves the attacking line; one branch becomes a sweep when defense over-commits.

- The system explicitly links K Guard to broader positional outcomes and alternate hubs.
  - Far side K transitions into reverse X guard mechanics and wrestle-up / sweep / back-take style outcomes while maintaining connection.
  - Heavy-base situations are treated as branch points (including a saddle option on the far leg) rather than forcing the same primary battle indefinitely.

- Upper-body attacks are layered as punishments for leg-defense reactions.
  - Shotgun armbar is emphasized with hip lift + armpit/shoulder control and alignment-first finishing priorities (open elbow; correct finishing orientation before ripping grips).
  - Triangle and sweep/lock branches are presented as reaction-driven options when arm and posture shapes make lower-body progression inefficient.

## 1.0 INSTRUCTIONAL VOLUME CONTENT

### 1.1 Volume 1: Foundations, Principles, and Entries
Establishes the K Guard structure and prerequisites (knee-off-the-mat off-balancing and scoop-grip control) and builds primary entry families from seated, supine, north-south, and reverse DLR connections.

### 1.2 Volume 2: Backside Attacks
Routes into backside offense when the opponent turns away, using backside 50/50 as the main hub to develop inside heel hook threats, follow backstep variations, add reverse Aoki options, and connect to matrix/X-hook back exposure sequences.

### 1.3 Volume 3: Frontside Attacks
Builds frontside offense when backside hooks are denied by prioritising angle creation (same-direction alignment) to run Aoki and outside heel hook lines, threat cycling and leg-switch dilemmas, plus sweep and alternate-structure branches (far side K/reverse X linkage, backroll sweep, saddle).

### 1.4 Volume 4: Upper-Body Attacks
Adds upper-body punishments that trigger off leg-defense reactions, centering on the shotgun armbar and branching to triangle setups/finishes and additional upper-body sweep/lock options.

## 2.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### 2.1 Primary Guard Identity (Base Shape)
- Open guard platform most commonly demonstrated against a kneeling base, with the opponent’s weight and posture determining the initial entry mechanics.
- Leg placement options are treated as two primary “frames” that can be blended:
  - Legs on the hips (distance + load management).
  - Legs on/near the armpit line (upper-body connection that supports rotation and upper-body threats).
- The position is treated as inherently “leg-lock-adjacent,” with the opponent’s most immediate counter being to grab/staple the leg and force a collapse into half guard if control connections are missing.

### 2.2 Structural Gates (What Must Be True Before Offense)
- Gate: Under-knee control connection (“scoop grip”)
  - Mandatory to prevent the opponent from simply grabbing the leg and forcing half guard.
  - If the scoop is not available immediately, upper-body control is used as a bridge until the scoop can be established.
- Gate: Knee position relative to elbow (bottom-knee hiding rule)
  - Bottom knee stays hidden behind the elbow line rather than flaring outside the elbow line.
  - Exposed knee outside the elbow line is treated as an invitation for counters (dropping under, stuffing rotation, forcing passing pressure).
- Gate: Knee separation (anti-collapse spacing rule)
  - Knees are kept apart rather than pinched together, preserving hip mobility and preventing the opponent from collapsing the structure and disengaging/passing cleanly.
- Gate: Second barrier concept (secondary-leg management)
  - Secondary leg is treated as a required “barrier” that prevents the opponent from freely stepping in, stapling, or walking around the structure while the primary connection is being built.

### 2.3 First Battle (Knee-Off-The-Mat Off-Balance)
- The first decisive battle is framed as getting the opponent’s knee off the mat before committing to rotation-based attacks.
- Off-balancing method selection is reaction-based:
  - If the opponent is upright enough to allow it, use lower-body pushing (blade-of-foot placement) paired with upper-body pulling to lift the knee.
  - If the opponent is leaning in and the blade-of-foot cannot be placed correctly, use a knee shield to create space and then place the blade-of-foot on the ribs.
  - Once blade-of-foot is placed, extend the working knee away from the chest to maintain structure and create a stable lever for off-balance.
  - If the opponent uses a heavy base (combat-base-like posture), “going around” before winning the off-balance is treated as making the position weak; hip lift and knee-shield structure are used to re-create the off-balance window.
- Off-balance is treated as permission to progress:
  - Knee stays planted/heavy → build structure and off-balance first.
  - Knee lifted/off-balanced → progress to side selection and attack lanes.

### 2.4 Routing Spine (Backside vs Frontside)
- Routing is defined as a response to the opponent’s defensive choices rather than a fixed preference.
- Backside lane is selected when the opponent’s reaction exposes backside access (turning/running away patterns that permit backside attachment and control progressions).
- Frontside lane is selected when backside access is denied:
  - The opponent opens the knee and prevents behind-knee hooks/attachments.
  - The opponent’s stance/position makes backside entries structurally difficult or low value.
  - The solution is to create a stronger angle for frontside attacks rather than forcing denied backside hooks.

### 2.5 Backside Lane (Core Hubs and Outcome Families)
- Backside hub is centered on backside 50/50 as a primary control-and-attack node.
- Primary submission family from the backside hub: inside heel hook development, with control-first priorities (stabilize the entanglement before chasing the finish).
- Stabilization/transition option appears when entanglement becomes mirrored or contested: double 50/50 consolidation before re-attacking.
- Reaction tracking is treated as mandatory:
  - When the opponent uses backstep-style reactions to change geometry, the system prioritizes maintaining attachment and following the transition rather than losing contact and resetting.
- Secondary submission threats in the same lane include reverse Aoki variations (inside/outside lines as complementary threats to the inside-heel-hook pathway).
- Back exposure routes are explicitly tied into the lane:
  - Matrix-style control is treated as condition-dependent; if the behind-knee hook is unavailable (only side-of-knee access), forcing the entry is treated as low value and routing changes.
  - X-hook sequences connect to leg-dragging and backtake outcomes, emphasizing connection maintenance during build-up.

### 2.6 Frontside Lane (Angle-First Outside Leg Lock Platform)
- Frontside is built around a foundational alignment requirement for outside leg locks: facing the same direction as the opponent.
- Angle creation is treated as the first action, not a detail added later:
  - Hip switching (e.g., moving from one hip to the other) is used to achieve same-direction alignment.
  - Grip structure supports angle creation by controlling the knee and ankle as the hips rotate.
  - Excess tension in the non-driving leg is treated as a common limiter to rotation; relaxation is used to preserve mobility.
- Once aligned, the lane’s primary threat families are layered from the same hub:
  - Aoki lock variations (inside line, outside line, and a belly-down completion pathway when reactions open that finish).
  - Outside heel hook lines (inside/outside variations as reaction-based alternates).
- Off-balancing forward/backward is used to prevent the opponent from stepping heavy and collapsing the aligned structure.
- Dilemma logic is emphasized:
  - Threat cycling keeps the hub while changing the finishing line rather than resetting.
  - Leg switch creates mutually reinforcing branches: improved submission line when space opens, sweep branch when defense over-commits.

### 2.7 Upper-Body Overlay (Punishment Layer Tied to Leg-Defense Reactions)
- Upper-body attacks are treated as direct responses when lower-body progression is structurally stalled (especially heavy base that prevents knee-off-the-mat progress).
- Shotgun armbar is framed as a primary branch when the knee-lift battle cannot be won:
  - Hip lift is used to create space rather than forcing rotation.
  - Elbow exposure is a key checkpoint (creating an elbow line on/near the ribs to isolate).
  - Wrist/hand orientation is treated as an alignment prerequisite for finishing (set the finishing alignment before ripping grips).
- Triangle is presented as a branch when the armbar is not available:
  - The leg configuration is built with knee/leg insertion into the armpit line and thigh positioned over the neck line.
  - Angle creation is treated as a prerequisite to breaking grips and closing the triangle.
  - Head control is treated as a key retention rule, preventing the opponent’s simplest escape route (lifting the head).
- Additional upper-body outcomes (sweep/lock branches) appear as reactions to posts/frames that expose exploitable upper-body structure, without abandoning the lower-body connection that created the opportunity.


## 3.0 CORE CONCEPTS

### 3.1 Structural Gates Before Rotation-Based Offense
- Under-knee control connection is treated as mandatory for the guard to function.
  - Without a control connection, the opponent can grab/staple the leg and force half guard; offense is delayed until control is re-established.
  - If direct under-knee control is not available immediately, bridge via alternate control (including upper-body control) until the under-knee connection is acquired.
- Bottom-knee hiding rule (knee behind elbow line).
  - Bottom knee stays hidden behind the elbow rather than flared outside.
  - Exposing the knee outside the elbow line is treated as a counter-trigger for the opponent (stuffing, countering, passing off your attempted rotation).
- Knee separation rule (anti-collapse).
  - Knees are kept apart rather than pinched together; pinching knees together is treated as giving the opponent an easy disengage/pass/collapse sequence.
- Secondary-leg “barrier” is treated as a required stabiliser.
  - Secondary leg is placed to prevent the opponent from freely stepping, reversing, or stapling while you build the primary attacking line.
  - Secondary-leg placement is adjusted based on the opponent’s attempt to control your knee line (e.g., reverse scoop / strong knee grip scenarios).

### 3.2 Knee-Off-The-Mat As the First Battle (Off-Balance Gate)
- Progression is permission-based: knee planted/heavy delays the “go-around”; knee lifted/off-balanced enables it.
- Off-balance tool selection depends on opponent posture and pressure.
  - If upright enough: use lower-body pushing (blade-of-foot placement) paired with upper-body pulling to lift the knee.
  - If leaning forward/heavy: use a knee-shield-style spacer to create enough distance to place the blade of the foot correctly, then re-initiate off-balance.
  - When blade-of-foot is placed: extend the working knee away from the chest to preserve structure and maintain lever efficiency.
- Heavy base is treated as a branch trigger rather than a “force harder” moment.
  - If lifting the knee becomes unrealistic, branch to sweep/alternate-structure options that do not require winning the same knee-lift battle (e.g., back roll sweep requirements; saddle branch on the far leg).

### 3.3 Under-Knee Grip Framework (Scoop / Reverse Scoop as Control Spine)
- Under-knee “scoop” is framed as the primary anti-collapse control.
  - It denies the opponent’s simplest answer (grabbing the leg and forcing half guard).
  - It anchors your ability to keep the opponent’s knee line in a predictable place while you rotate or change hips.
- Reverse scoop and secondary grip layers appear as answers to the opponent’s grip fight.
  - When the opponent establishes a strong grip on your knee line (reverse scoop scenarios), the response includes:
    - Moving hips back to regain extension and reduce their ability to staple.
    - Extending the controlling knee away from the chest to re-establish the structural wedge.
- Grip timing rule: control first, then progress.
  - When the grip is contested, the priority is to stabilise the connection and win the positional gate before attempting to “go around” or chase a finish.

### 3.4 Secondary-Leg Barrier Concept (Why It Exists and Where It Goes)
- Secondary leg is treated as the second barrier that prevents easy countering while you build the attacking line.
- Placement logic is conditional.
  - When you are winning the knee battle: secondary leg can be placed to enable the go-around and route selection (backside/frontside).
  - When you are losing the knee battle (opponent controls your knee / reverse scoop pressure): secondary leg placement shifts to protect structure and re-create space (including moving hips back and placing the foot inside rather than chasing an ideal hook).
- Secondary leg is also a bridge to upper-body threats.
  - When the opponent commits to controlling your knee line, an inside foot placement and hip retreat can create a safer frame from which you can re-insert the foot and transition to upper-body attacks (triangles are explicitly referenced as a follow-on option once the inside barrier is established).

### 3.5 Supine Guard Entry Principle (Preventing Early Two-Hand Control)
- When playing on the back, pointing both legs in the same direction is treated as allowing easy double grips (two C-grips on both legs).
- Default adjustment is asymmetry: one leg up, one leg down.
  - This reduces the opponent’s ability to secure simultaneous control on both legs and supports recovery into a low-leg retention structure that can feed the K Guard entry.
- If the opponent wins the early grip battle, the sequence includes:
  - Use upper-body framing to break grips.
  - Re-establish asymmetric leg positioning.
  - Re-enter into the K Guard structure once under-knee access becomes available.

### 3.6 Lasso as a Safety Wedge (When the Bottom Leg Battle Is Lost)
- If the opponent wins the bottom-leg battle and compromises low-leg retention, lasso is used as an immediate safety structure.
  - Frame first, insert lasso inside, regain safety, then rebuild entry alignment.
- The lasso is not presented as the endpoint; it is a stabilising bridge.
  - Once lasso is established, the next priority is restoring the attacking structure (re-creating the entry to K Guard or branching to other attacks if the position opens).

### 3.7 Backside vs Frontside Routing (Selection by Denial and Orientation)
- Route selection is treated as a response to opponent denial rather than a preference-based choice.
- Backside route is supported when the opponent runs/turns away and exposes a backside orientation that allows progression to backside hubs (backside 50/50 is repeatedly treated as the central hub).
- Frontside route becomes the default when backside access is denied.
  - Denial signals include inability to reach/maintain the far-hip line and inability to secure behind-knee/matrix-style attachments.
  - In denial scenarios, the priority becomes angle creation for frontside attacks rather than forcing a low-value backside entry.

### 3.8 Backstep Is a Central Reaction (Control Must Address It)
- Backstep is treated as a primary opponent reaction that can defeat careless entanglement progressions.
- Preventive concept appears: chest-to-mat/extension logic.
  - When the opponent can backstep out, the response includes turning the chest toward the mat and extending the lower body to reduce the opponent’s ability to freely change geometry.
- Follow concept appears: anticipate and move with the backstep.
  - When the backstep is felt/initiated, the response includes opening the knee, using the same control idea, and following the rotation rather than resetting.
  - Momentum usage is explicitly referenced in the follow sequence (building to elbow, lifting hips, inserting the foot inside to arrive in a stable continuation position).

### 3.9 Heavy-Base Branching (Back Roll Sweep and Saddle as Explicit Alternatives)
- Back roll sweep is explicitly tied to a prerequisite condition: the opponent must base with an arm.
  - When lifting the knee is not possible and the opponent posts, roll over the right shoulder and carry the knee through the roll.
  - Key retention cue: “take the knee with you” to prevent the opponent winning the post-roll battle and staying on top.
- Saddle is explicitly tied to a specific heavy-base scenario: the opponent is very heavy on the middle leg.
  - The solution involves switching the under-knee control from the middle leg to the far leg (control transfer as the core mechanic).
  - Hip-lift is used to clear the original K Guard leg so the far leg can be captured cleanly.
  - Base placement is treated as critical (including attention to foot placement on the far hip to prevent the opponent smashing the saddle).

### 3.10 Upper-Body Punishment Principle (Precision and Alignment Over Speed)
- Upper-body attacks are framed as direct punishments for leg-defense reactions that stall lower-body progress.
- Armbar alignment principle (thumb orientation rule).
  - Precision is treated as mandatory: if finishing alignment is wrong, the opponent can rotate the elbow line and escape.
  - Thumb orientation is treated as the simple check that determines whether the elbow will be able to turn out and survive.
- Triangle retention principle (head control + knee pit placement).
  - Knee pit must hook the neck line; small placement errors materially reduce finishing ability.
  - Head control is treated as a retention rule because lifting the head is identified as a primary escape route.
  - Angle creation is treated as a finishing prerequisite: grab your own shin, step on the hip, then choose an arm position (under armpit as lower risk vs under leg as higher angle but higher smash-pass risk).
  - Finish mechanics include: leg over shoulder line, knees pointed to the same side, and removing the gap by correct knee/heel action rather than squeezing from a loose triangle.


## 4.0 TECHNIQUE LIBRARY

### 4.1 Volume 1 — K Guard Foundations and Entries (Structure, Grips, Routes)

#### 4.1.1 K Guard Structural Gates (Non-Negotiables)
- Entry conditions
  - You are building K Guard from seated, supine, north-south, or reverse DLR conversion.
- Primary controls
  - Under-knee control via scoop grip (primary connection).
  - Secondary leg used as an active barrier.
- Structure rules (acceptance criteria)
  - Bottom knee stays behind the elbow line (knee-hide rule).
  - Knees stay separated (no knee pinch).
  - Secondary leg remains active as a barrier (prevents step-in/staple while building).
- Opponent main counters (as framed)
  - Step closer to collapse/staple into half guard.
  - Two-hand control on both legs (especially vs poor supine alignment).
- Primary continuations
  - Only after scoop + structure gates are satisfied: off-balance gate work (knee-off-mat) and routing.
- Abort criteria
  - If scoop is not present or structure gates fail: pause offense, rebuild structure, re-acquire scoop.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Attacking without scoop -> immediate scoop recovery priority.
  - Knee flares outside elbow -> reset to knee-hide rule.
  - Knees pinch -> reset to separation.
  - Barrier leg passive -> re-place barrier before progressing.
- End state
  - Stable K Guard structure with scoop + barrier + mobility preserved.

#### 4.1.2 Off-Balance Gate: “Knee Off The Mat” (Permission To Rotate)
- Entry conditions
  - K Guard structure built with scoop and barrier leg functioning.

  - Extend working knee away from chest to preserve lever and prevent collapse.
- Opponent main counters
  - Lean forward (denies clean blade-of-foot placement).
  - Combat base / heavy posture (makes “go around” structurally weak).
- Primary continuations
  - Once knee is lifted/off-balanced: route to backside or frontside lane.
- Abort criteria
  - If blade-of-foot placement is denied by posture: insert knee shield to create space, then re-place.
  - If heavy base persists: shift to rebuild mode or conditional branches (post-based sweep / saddle / upper-body overlay).
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Forcing rotation under heavy knee -> treat as error; rebuild off-balance first.
- End state
  - Opponent’s knee lifted/off-balanced, creating a safe window to route and progress.

- Structure rules
  - Same-direction alignment is a hard prerequisite (angle gate).
- Opponent main counters
  - Stiff base, stepping heavy, clearing alignment.
- Primary continuations
  - Angle creation hub -> Aoki/outside HH -> dilemma cycling -> sweeps.
- Abort criteria
  - If alignment cannot be achieved due to heavy base: shift to rebuild/branch logic (post-based sweep / saddle / upper-body overlay).
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Attacking outside locks without alignment -> return to angle gate first.
- End state
  - Same-direction alignment achieved with control preserved.

#### 4.3.2 Angle Creation Hub (Same-Direction Alignment Gate)

  - Frontside lane chosen due to denial signals.
- Primary controls
  - Hip switching while maintaining control to achieve “same way” alignment.
- Structure rules
  - Alignment before finishing attempts.
- Opponent main counters
  - Heavy stepping / base that prevents clean hip switching.
- Primary continuations
  - Aoki variations and outside heel hook variations from aligned hub.
  - Threat cycling without losing alignment.
- Abort criteria
  - If alignment breaks: reset to angle creation rather than forcing finishes.

- End state
  - Outside heel hook attack from aligned hub.

#### 4.3.5 Threat Cycling and Leg Switch Dilemma (Sweep Branch)
- Entry conditions
  - Aligned hub with opponent defending primary line.
- Primary controls
  - Maintain hub while changing threats (do not reset).
- Structure rules
  - Threat changes occur without losing alignment.
- Opponent main counters
  - Over-commit defense on one line; posture/base adjustments to step out.
- Primary continuations
  - Leg switch creates a dilemma: improve line or sweep when defense commits.
- Abort criteria
  - If hub breaks during cycling: reset to angle creation.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Cycling threats while losing alignment -> treat as hub failure; rebuild angle.
- End state
  - Either improved finishing line or sweep outcome via dilemma.

#### 4.3.6 Back Roll Sweep (Prerequisite: Opponent Posts A Hand)
- Entry conditions
  - Heavy base stalls progress; opponent must post a hand for base.
- Primary controls
  - Create the post; then initiate the back roll.
- Structure rules
  - Do not attempt without the post prerequisite.
  - Carry the knee through the roll as the key retention rule.
- Opponent main counters
  - Refusing to post; stabilizing after roll if knee is not carried through.
- Primary continuations
  - Sweep to top once roll completes with knee carried.
- Abort criteria
  - No post -> create post first; do not force roll.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Rolling without post -> treat as unavailable.

### 4.4 Volume 4 — Upper-Body Overlay (Shotgun Armbar, Sweeps, Triangle, Choibar)

#### 4.4.1 Upper-Body Trigger Logic (When To Switch Off Lower-Body Battle)
- Entry conditions
  - You are attacking lower body from K Guard but opponent uses upper body/frames to stall and you cannot win the knee-lift battle.
- Primary controls
  - Hip lift to create space for elbow/shoulder isolation.
- Structure rules
  - Treat upper-body attacks as punishment when lower-body progress is structurally stalled.
- Opponent main counters
  - Strong frames; elbow placement to mat; grip fighting to prevent isolation.
- Primary continuations
  - Shotgun armbar line.
  - Triangle setup/finish when armbar line is not available.
  - Flower sweep / mirror lock / choibar branches as presented.
- Abort criteria
  - If isolation is not present: return to structure rebuild and re-open the trigger.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Staying in stalled lower-body battle too long -> switch when trigger condition is met.
- End state
  - Clean transition into upper-body isolation without losing base/connection.

#### 4.4.2 Shotgun Armbar (Isolation and Finishing Alignment)
- Entry conditions
  - Opponent’s arm is used to stop legs/deny progress and becomes accessible to isolate.
- Primary controls (as described)
  - Grab/control the elbow line first.
  - Prevent the arm from getting “too deep” (avoid losing the window to isolate).
  - Place wrist into armpit as part of finishing alignment.
- Structure rules
  - Precision is emphasized; thumb direction is used as an alignment reference.
  - Hand placement detail: place hand above elbow; finger-on-elbow reference used to guide pressure.
  - Use the leg frame as needed while isolating (framing described during armbar setup).
- Opponent main counters
  - Gripping/pulling while you try to set wrist-to-armpit.
  - Pulling arm deeper to escape the isolation window.
- Primary continuations
  - Once alignment is set (wrist to armpit; thumb direction managed): break grip and finish by applying the final pressure.
- Abort criteria
  - If wrist cannot be seated to armpit: do not rush grip break; reset alignment first.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Breaking grips before alignment -> set wrist-to-armpit and thumb alignment first.
- End state
  - Armbar finish achieved from correct isolation/alignment.

#### 4.4.3 Shotgun Armbar Variations (Grip Responses)
- Entry conditions
  - Opponent changes grips/frames while you maintain elbow control.
- Primary controls
  - Maintain elbow capture while adapting to grip configuration.
- Structure rules
  - “Idea is the same” across grip looks: isolate elbow line, set wrist-to-armpit alignment, then finish.
- Opponent main counters
  - Alternate grips on leg/arm; posting elbow on mat to change angle.
- Primary continuations
  - Re-route to best finishing grip while preserving elbow control.
- Abort criteria
  - If elbow control is lost: re-capture elbow before attempting to finish.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Chasing the finish while elbow slips -> elbow is the anchor; re-grip.
- End state
  - Armbar finish maintained across grip variations.

#### 4.4.4 Flower Sweep (Post/Elbow Reactions)
- Entry conditions
  - Opponent places/elbows/posts in a way that creates sweep leverage from the same K Guard scenario.
- Primary controls
  - Use the opponent’s base reaction (post/elbow placement) to generate the sweep.
- Structure rules
  - Sweep appears as a reaction-based option when upper-body pressure is available.
- Opponent main counters
  - Changing base to remove posting arm; re-centering weight.
- Primary continuations
  - Sweep to top once base is compromised.
- Abort criteria
  - If post is removed and leverage is gone: return to armbar/triangle branches or rebuild.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Sweeping without reaction-based leverage -> treat as unavailable until reaction appears.
- End state
  - Top position via reaction-based sweep.
- Coverage note
  - Coverage incomplete due to missing or insufficient transcript content.

#### 4.4.5 Mirror Lock (Upper-Body Lock Option)
- Entry conditions

- Primary controls
  - No transcript-derived detail available beyond the label “mirror lock.”
- Structure rules
  - No transcript-derived content available for this technique.
- Opponent main counters
  - No transcript-derived content available for this technique.
- Primary continuations
  - No transcript-derived content available for this technique.
- Abort criteria
  - No transcript-derived content available for this technique.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - No transcript-derived content available for this technique.
- End state
  - No transcript-derived content available for this technique.

#### 4.4.6 Triangle Setup (From Stalled Armbar Line)
- Entry conditions
  - Armbar line is “not there” or opponent keeps grip/structure that blocks clean armbar completion.
- Primary controls (setup priorities)
  - Keep head controlled (head lift is described as an easy escape route).
  - Place knee into armpit line; leg goes on top of neck line to begin triangle structure.
- Structure rules
  - Create angle before trying to finish; do not attempt to finish square.
  - Arm positioning trade-off appears:
    - Under armpit is described as less risky.
    - Under leg can create stronger angle but increases smash-pass risk.
- Opponent main counters
  - Strong grip and posture; head-lift escape behavior.
- Primary continuations
  - Proceed into triangle finish mechanics (4.4.7).
- Abort criteria
  - If head control is lost and posture rises: re-control head and re-create angle before closing.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Closing without angle -> grab shin/shoe + step on hip to angle first.
- End state
  - Triangle established with angle and head control maintained.

#### 4.4.7 Triangle Finish (Placement, Angle, and Gap-Closing Mechanics)
- Entry conditions
  - Triangle structure is closed or nearly closed but requires angle/placement to finish reliably.
- Primary controls
  - Hold the head throughout the finishing sequence (head-lift escape prevention).
- Structure rules (finish gates)
  - Knee pit hooks the neck line; missing this makes finishing difficult.
  - Leg covers over the shoulder line; shoulder closes the second side of the neck.
  - Create a better angle before squeezing (grab shin/shoe + step on hip).
  - Before squeezing: point both knees to the same side.
  - Gap removal cue: set the right knee into the left-knee line first, then squeeze.
- Opponent main counters
  - Head lift and posture recovery; surviving due to finishing gap.
- Primary continuations
  - Angle creation -> knee alignment -> gap removal -> squeeze.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot achieve angle and knee alignment: reset the angle first rather than squeezing a loose triangle.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Squeezing with a big gap -> point knees same side, close right knee into left knee, then squeeze.
- End state
  - Strong finish once placement, angle, and knee alignment remove the gap.

#### 4.4.8 Choibar (Transcript Term Appears As “Troy Bar” / Triangle-Armbar Link)
- Entry conditions
  - Opponent achieves chest-to-chest pressure; choibar is introduced as different from “regular Troy Bar.”
- Primary controls (as described)
  - Switch from lower-body battle to shoulder control.
  - Use a V-grip on the neck (explicitly referenced).
  - Extend left leg and push head close (distance/head positioning effect described).
  - Place left leg inside the arm (described as different from the regular version).
  - Right foot is used to maintain/control distance (explicit function noted).
- Structure rules
  - Shoulder control is prioritized during the switch.
  - Distance control via right foot is treated as a key stabilizer in the configuration.
- Opponent main counters
  - Trying to catch/hold their own side to prevent the arm attack (explicitly referenced reaction).
- Primary continuations
  - Progress the arm-attack line once head/shoulder/distance controls are set.
- Abort criteria
  - If shoulder control and distance are not secured: re-secure those controls before forcing the arm entry.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Losing distance control -> re-establish right-foot distance control before inserting/finishing.
- End state
  - Choibar configuration established as an upper-body finishing branch.
- Coverage note
  - Coverage incomplete due to missing or insufficient transcript content.


## 5.0 DIAGRAM SET

### 5.1 K Guard Macro Map (Gates → Routing → Outcomes)
- Core gates
  - Off-balance gate: knee-off-the-mat before rotation-based offense.
  - Control gate: scoop (under-knee) control before committing to entries/attacks.
  - Structure gate: bottom knee hidden behind elbow line; knees separated; secondary-leg barrier present.
- Primary routing fork
  - Backside when opponent turns away/runs and backside access is available.
  - Frontside when backside hooks are denied (knee opened; behind-knee hook unavailable) and angle creation is required.
- Punishment overlay
  - Upper-body branch triggers when lower-body progress is structurally stalled (heavy base/defensive reactions).

### 5.2 Routing Decision Map (Backside vs Frontside)
- Backside selection logic
  - Chosen when the opponent’s movement and orientation give backside access (turning away / running patterns that permit backside attachment).
- Frontside selection logic
  - Chosen when backside hooks/attachments are denied (knee opened; behind-knee hook unavailable), requiring same-direction alignment for outside leg locks.
- “Do not force denied entry” rule
  - Denial of behind-knee hook is treated as a hard signal to route away, not to insist.

### 5.3 Entry Family Map (Volume 1 Connection Points → K Guard Structure)
- Principle shared by all entries
  - Rebuild to the same structural gates: scoop control, knee hidden behind elbow line, knees separated, secondary-leg barrier.
- Entry families shown in transcript
  - Seated: lower-body dominant path.
  - Seated: upper-body bridge path when leg access is denied.
  - Supine: low-leg retention path with asymmetric leg positioning to prevent two-hand control.
  - Supine: lasso wedge rescue when the bottom-leg battle is lost.
  - North-south: frame-to-space conversion into inside-foot insertion and rebuild.
  - Reverse DLR: connection-based conversion that requires solving head distance so the bottom leg can be freed.

### 5.4 Heavy Base Branch Map (When Knee-Off-The-Mat Does Not Open)
- Trigger state
  - Knee stays heavy/planted; opponent weight makes the primary knee-lift battle inefficient.
- Required response
  - Do not proceed with loose rotation; either rebuild structure to reopen the off-balance window, or branch to heavy-base solutions when defined conditions appear.
- Defined heavy-base branches in transcript
  - Back roll sweep requires the opponent to base with a hand; success depends on carrying the knee through the roll.
  - Saddle branch is treated as an alternate entanglement path when far-leg capture becomes higher value than persisting on the same battle.

## 6.0 DRILLING PROGRESSIONS

### 6.1 K Guard Structure Gate Drill (Knee Hide + Secondary Leg + No Knee Pinch)
- Start state
  - Partner kneeling in front (or standing variation as shown), you are entering K Guard structure.
- Repetition goal
  - Arrive in K Guard with the bottom knee hidden behind the elbow line and the secondary leg placed as a barrier.
- Checkpoints (must hit every rep)
  - Bottom knee stays behind the elbow (do not flare the knee outside the elbow line).
  - Do not bring the knees together (knee pinch is treated as a structural error that makes disengage/pass easier).
  - Secondary leg is active as a barrier (prevents easy step-in/staple while primary connection is built).
- Failure triggers to reset the rep
  - Bottom knee drifts outside the elbow line.
  - Knees pinch together.
  - Secondary leg becomes passive and the partner can step in and collapse the structure.

### 6.2 Off-Balance Gate Drill (Get the Knee Off the Mat Before “Go Around”)
- Start state
  - Partner kneeling; you are in K Guard entry structure and preparing to progress.
- Repetition goal
  - Off-balance with push/pull to get the partner’s knee off the mat before rotating around for attacks.
- Variations by partner posture (drill all three as separate reps)
  - Partner’s head high (upright posture)
    - Place the blade of the foot to the ribs (clean placement).
    - Push with the lower body and pull with the upper body to lift the knee off the mat.
  - Partner leaning forward (head low; hard to place the blade of the foot)
    - Insert a knee shield to create the distance required for blade-of-foot placement.
    - Once the blade of the foot is on the ribs, extend the working knee away from the chest to keep structure.
    - Re-run push/pull off-balance to lift the knee.
  - Partner uses a combat base (heavy posture that makes “go around” weak)
    - Treat early “go around” as a structural error.
    - Use the knee shield and come up to rebuild posture/space, then re-initiate off-balance.
- Constraints
  - If the knee is still planted and stable, do not progress to rotation-based offense.
  - Maintain structure while off-balancing (do not sacrifice the knee hide / barrier leg to chase movement).

### 6.3 Scoop Grip Recovery Drill (Loss of Scoop = Immediate Priority Shift)
- Start state
  - Partner begins to grab/staple your leg and force you toward half guard when your under-knee control is compromised.
- Repetition goal
  - Rebuild under-knee control (scoop) before resuming offense.
- Key checkpoints
  - Treat the moment of losing the scoop as the moment the guard becomes vulnerable to collapse.
  - Re-establish the scoop connection first; offense resumes only after the connection is back.

### 6.4 Lasso-to-K Guard Recovery Drill (When the Bottom-Leg Battle Is Lost)
- Start state
  - Partner wins the low-leg retention battle and threatens to collapse/control your bottom leg.
- Repetition goal
  - Use lasso as a safety wedge, then transition back into K Guard entry structure.
- Sequence checkpoints (repeatable order)
  - Frame to create enough space to insert the lasso.
  - Insert the lasso and stabilize (“safe” position).
  - Break the partner’s grip and lift hips as needed to reopen space for the K Guard entry.
  - Transition from lasso wedge back into K Guard structure (under-knee access and connection restored).
- Constraint
  - Lasso is used as a stabilization bridge; transition back to the K Guard entry once structure is regained.

### 6.5 Reverse De La Riva to K Guard Entry Drill (Connection → Free Bottom Leg → Immediate Scoop)
- Start state
  - You are in reverse de la Riva connection.
- Repetition goal
  - Convert reverse DLR into K Guard entry without allowing the partner to staple the leg into half guard/reverse DLR counters.
- Checkpoints
  - Establish the “foot between you and partner” barrier when available (improves safety and spacing).
  - As soon as entry alignment opens, go immediately for the scoop grip and then look for unbalance.
  - Treat reverse DLR as a reliable place to find grips; once grips are acquired, transition into K Guard structure rather than stalling.

### 6.6 Backside 50/50 Hub to Reverse Aoki Drill (Backstep Reaction → Grip Switch → Finish Mechanics)
- Start state
  - You have entered backside 50/50 off K Guard (including versus a standing opponent as shown).
- Repetition goal
  - When the partner backsteps, switch from heel-hook grip to ankle-hook grip and run reverse Aoki mechanics with correct body positioning.
- Sequence checkpoints
  - As the backstep begins, switch from heel-hook grip to ankle-hook grip (grip change tied to the reaction).
  - Maintain hip orientation as described (stay on the outside hip rather than flattening).
  - Build the V-grip under the knee as a prerequisite for the finishing mechanics.
  - Create distance before chasing heel exposure (distance is treated as the first requirement).
  - Expose the heel by moving the ribcage back (do not “open the chest” forward).
  - Reverse Aoki finishing alignment cue: thumb points to the chest.
  - If the opponent is tall, move hips back as needed to keep exposure and alignment.
  - Finish by moving the elbow back once exposure is achieved.
- Constraints
  - Do not expose the heel by opening the chest; exposure is built by ribcage-back space creation.
  - Do not skip the V-grip under-knee prerequisite if the finish is not structurally available.

### 6.7 Roll-Through Positioning Drill (End the Roll in a Strong Outside Position)
- Start state
  - You are running a roll-through transition (frontside/outside leg lock pathway context).
- Repetition goal
  - Switch the legs during/after the roll so you end “immediately in a good spot” on the outside with strong bridging ability.
- Checkpoints
  - Do not stay all the way on the elbow during the finishing phase; move to the described “middle” upper-body position to use hips effectively.
  - Switch the legs so that after finishing the roll you land on the outside in a structurally strong position.
  - End-state cue: landing position allows easy bridging and hip-forward movement into the primary finish mechanics.
- Constraint
  - Treat the end position after the roll as the drill’s success criterion (not the roll itself).

### 6.8 Back Roll Sweep Drill (Prerequisite: Opponent Posts a Hand)
- Start state
  - Partner is heavy and lifting pressure makes it hard to lift them off the mat; partner is not using hands initially.
- Repetition goal
  - Create a hand post, then execute the back roll sweep while carrying the knee through the roll.
- Sequence checkpoints
  - Create the condition: drive/push to force the partner to use a hand for base.
  - Once the post exists, initiate the back roll sweep.
  - Key retention cue: carry the knee through the roll (“take the knee with you”).
- Constraint
  - If the partner is not posting, treat the sweep as not yet available; first create the post condition.

### 6.9 Saddle Branch Drill (Heavy Middle Leg → Control Transfer to Far Leg → Base on Far Hip)
- Start state
  - Partner is very heavy on the middle leg; lifting that leg is difficult.
- Repetition goal
  - Take saddle on the far leg by switching scoop grip from the middle leg to the far leg with correct hip lift and base placement.
- Sequence checkpoints
  - Lift hips to clear the K Guard leg and create the space required for leg travel.
  - Switch scoop grip from the middle leg to the far leg (control transfer is the central action).
  - Establish a good base on the far hip; without this base the partner can smash the saddle.
  - Use the lift-and-clear cycle to prevent the partner collapsing the entry as you switch targets.
- Constraints
  - Do not enter the saddle without far-hip base; entry without base is treated as structurally weak and smashable.
  - Hip lift is treated as required to clear and transfer; skipping hip lift degrades entry quality.

### 6.10 Triangle Mechanics Drill (Angle Gate + Head Control + Shin/Leg Placement)
- Start state
  - Upper-body exposure exists off K Guard configurations; triangle becomes available as a branch.
- Repetition goal
  - Establish triangle with correct placement and finish mechanics.
- Checkpoints
  - Keep head control (lifting the head is treated as a primary escape route).
  - Place the knee pit so it hooks the neck line (precision placement requirement).
  - Create angle before attempting to close and finish (grab your own shin; step on the hip to create angle).
  - Arm positioning choice as shown
    - Under-armpit option treated as lower risk.
    - Under-leg option creates stronger angle but increases smash-pass risk.
  - Finish mechanics cues
    - Leg covers over the shoulder line.
    - Knees point to the same side during final compression.
    - Remove gaps by correct leg/heel positioning rather than squeezing a loose configuration.


## 7.0 APPLICATION SCENARIOS

### 7.1 Kneeling Opponent With Upright Posture (Clean Off-Balance Window)
- Trigger / recognition
  - Opponent kneeling with posture high enough that blade-of-foot placement to the ribs is available without needing a spacer first.
- Objective
  - Lift the opponent’s knee off the mat (permission to progress to rotation/routing).
- Actions
  - Place the blade of the foot to the ribs (not a lazy foot-on-hip placement).
  - Pair lower-body push with upper-body pull to shift their base and lift the knee.
  - Extend the working knee away from the chest to keep the lever strong and prevent collapse.
- Success criteria
  - Knee comes off the mat and the opponent’s base is disrupted enough that continuation is stable.
- Failure modes / fixes
  - Foot cannot be placed cleanly because posture drops mid-entry.
    - Switch immediately to the knee-shield spacer sequence (see 7.2) rather than forcing the same entry.

### 7.2 Kneeling Opponent Leaning Forward (Foot Placement Denied Until Space Is Made)
- Trigger / recognition
  - Opponent’s chest/head drops forward and blocks clean blade-of-foot placement to the ribs.
- Objective
  - Create space first, then re-run the off-balance.
- Actions
  - Insert a knee shield to create the distance required for correct blade-of-foot placement.
  - Place the blade of the foot on the ribs from the created distance.
  - Keep extending the controlling knee away from the chest so the lever stays strong and does not collapse.
  - Run push/pull to lift the knee off the mat.
- Constraints
  - Do not proceed to “go around” offense while the knee is still planted and stable.
- Success criteria
  - You can keep the leg “in place” while off-balancing, and the knee lifts off the mat.

### 7.3 Opponent Uses Combat Base (Going Around Is Weak Until Structure Changes)
- Trigger / recognition
  - Opponent kneeling but switching to combat base to resist off-balance and/or to punish rotation attempts.
- Objective
  - Prevent weak “go around” attempts; change structure and re-open the off-balance window.
- Actions
  - Treat early “go around” as structurally weak in combat base and do not commit to it.
  - Use the knee shield and come up (posture change) instead of staying flat and trying to rotate around a stable base.
  - Use the knee shield plus upper-body connection (gable-grip framing described in transcript) to change the angle of the opponent’s shin and disrupt base.
  - Lift the hips as part of the structural adjustment when the opponent’s weight pins the primary battle.
- Success criteria
  - The opponent’s shin angle and base are altered enough that attacks can be set up again (knee begins to become liftable / base becomes movable).
- Failure modes / fixes
  - Staying flat and “stubbornly” pushing while their base remains stable.
    - Switch to the “knee shield + come up” solution immediately.

### 7.4 Opponent Closes Distance To Staple Your Leg (Half Guard / Reverse DLR Collapse Attempt)
- Trigger / recognition
  - Opponent steps closer and begins to collapse distance to force you into half guard or reverse DLR-like containment.
- Objective
  - Win the anti-collapse race: insert the knee to the chest and acquire the scoop grip immediately.
- Actions
  - Bring the knee to the chest as the opponent steps in (prevents easy stapling angle).
  - Go immediately for the scoop grip (explicit “no K guard without the scoop grip” constraint appears in transcript).
  - Use the hand to stop the opponent’s foot/ankle from coming closer to your hips when they step forward.
  - Rebuild the two-grip structure shown (scoop + secondary control) before attempting to progress.
- Success criteria
  - Scoop grip is established while distance is managed, and the opponent cannot force the collapse into half guard/reverse DLR containment.
- Failure modes / fixes
  - Attacking while “holding nothing” on the leg.
    - Treat this as an immediate reset to scoop acquisition rather than continuing offense.

### 7.5 Opponent Backsteps Out of the Entanglement (Backstep Is the Main Problem)
- Trigger / recognition
  - You reach a strong lower-body finishing structure and the opponent attempts to backstep to change geometry and escape.
- Objective
  - Prevent or neutralize the backstep by changing your body orientation and lower-body structure, then continue to exposure/finish.
- Actions (prevention/neutralization sequence described in transcript)
  - Use the lower body as described rather than “turning the knee down” into a weaker configuration.
  - Scissor/cross the legs to place the knees at (or close to) the same level and shift the opponent’s knee off the mat onto your bottom hip.
  - Turn the chest to face the mat and extend the lower body (knee extension away from the chest) to reduce the opponent’s ability to backstep freely.
  - Re-run exposure from this stabilized structure; continuation may route into the frontside finishing scenario depending on the resulting alignment.
- Success criteria
  - The opponent cannot sit back and re-base via backstep; heel exposure becomes achievable without losing control.
- Failure modes / fixes
  - Allowing the opponent to backstep before your scissoring/extension structure is in place.
    - Prioritize leg structure first (knees level + chest-to-mat orientation + extension), then return to exposure.

### 7.6 Opponent Backsteps While You Have Heel/Leg Control (Backstep → Backside 50/50 → Reverse Aoki)
- Trigger / recognition
  - Opponent backsteps during the entanglement while you are controlling the leg/heel line.
- Objective
  - Use the backstep as the trigger to transition into backside 50/50 and apply reverse Aoki mechanics.
- Actions (timing + mechanics checkpoints from transcript)
  - As the backstep begins, wait for the leg timing and capture the ankle.
  - Go deeper with the leg position and use the capture to enter backside 50/50.
  - Choose the reverse Aoki option from the backside 50/50 hub when appropriate.
  - Create distance first (distance is identified as the first requirement before exposure).
  - Expose the heel by moving the ribcage back (explicit constraint: do not “open the chest” to expose).
  - Finishing alignment cue: thumb points to the chest during reverse Aoki.
  - If the opponent is very tall, move the hips back to maintain exposure and alignment.
  - Finish by moving the elbow back once exposure is achieved.
- Opponent escape model (explicit in transcript)
  - Primary escape cue referenced: extending the leg.
- Success criteria
  - You maintain attachment through the backstep, create the required distance, expose without opening the chest, and apply the finishing alignment.
- Failure modes / fixes
  - Trying to expose by opening the chest forward.
    - Replace with ribcage-back space creation before attempting to lock.

### 7.7 Heavy Opponent Who Refuses To Post Hands (Upper-Body Attacks Hard → Back Roll Sweep Branch)
- Trigger / recognition
  - Opponent is very heavy on the primary leg and is not using hands for base; upper-body attack setup is difficult.
- Objective
  - Create a basing hand, then execute the back roll sweep while carrying the knee through the roll.
- Actions
  - Recognize the constraint: if they are not posting, upper-body setup is difficult and the roll is not yet “available.”
  - Force the condition by making them base with an arm (explicit prerequisite).
  - Once they post, roll over the right shoulder as described.
  - Carry the knee through the roll (“take the knee with you”) so it is difficult for them to win the post-roll battle and stay on top.
- Success criteria
  - You achieve the roll with the knee carried through, and the opponent cannot remain on top after the transition.
- Failure modes / fixes
  - Rolling without first creating the post.
    - Re-run the prerequisite creation until the post exists.

### 7.8 Heavy Base Prevents Knee Lift (Lower-Body Stall → Shotgun Armbar → Triangle If Armbar Not There)
- Trigger / recognition
  - You are going for the leg but cannot lift the knee off the mat due to heavy base.
- Objective
  - Switch to an upper-body punishment sequence that does not require lifting the knee.
- Actions (shotgun armbar branch)
  - Lift the hips instead of continuing to fight for knee lift.
  - Move upper body back to expose the opponent’s elbow on your ribs (explicit positioning outcome).
  - Adjust the wrist into the armpit (explicit adjustment checkpoint).
- Triangle branch (when armbar is “not there”)
  - If the armbar is not available, place the knee to the armpit line and put the thigh on top of the neck line.
  - Create a greater angle (explicit requirement) and go up with the hips to improve control.
  - Treat head lift as the easiest escape route; keep the head controlled as the triangle is built.
- Success criteria
  - You convert the stall into a reliable upper-body attack sequence without losing the control that made the branch possible.
- Failure modes / fixes
  - Continuing to insist on knee lift when base remains heavy.
    - Switch immediately to hip-lift-based upper-body entry (armbar/triangle decision).


## 8.0 FOUR-WEEK CURRICULUM

### 8.1 Week 1 — Volume 1: Structure, Gates, and Entries
- Primary outcomes to build
  - Win and hold K Guard structure without collapse into half guard.
  - Win knee-off-the-mat off-balancing before attempting any rotation-based offense.
  - Rebuild structure from multiple starting positions (seated, supine, north-south, reverse DLR).
- Technical focus (order is gating-based)
  - K Guard structural gates
    - Bottom knee hidden behind the elbow line (avoid flaring knee outside elbow).
    - Knees separated (avoid pinching knees together).
    - Secondary leg actively used as a barrier (do not allow easy step-in/staple).
    - Under-knee control acquired (scoop/reverse scoop concept).
  - Off-balance gate (knee-off-the-mat)
    - Upright posture: blade-of-foot placement to ribs + push/pull to lift knee.
    - Forward posture: knee shield to create distance → blade-of-foot placement → push/pull.
    - Heavy base: hip lift and structural rebuild rather than “going around” early.
  - Entry families
    - Seated lower-body entry sequence (hip close → far-hip extension → stop foot closing to hips → immediate under-knee control).
    - Seated upper-body bridge entry when leg access is denied (upper-body control → create space → reacquire under-knee control).
    - Supine entry emphasis on preventing early two-hand control on both legs (asymmetry principle) and rebuilding low-leg retention to reach under-knee access.
    - Lasso as a safety wedge when the bottom-leg battle is lost (frame → lasso wedge → rebuild entry).
    - North-south conversion (frame → insert barrier → foot inside → rebuild to under-knee control).
    - Reverse DLR conversion (solve head distance to free bottom leg → extend to far hip → immediate under-knee control).
- Drilling progression (constraint-based)
  - Structure gate drill with immediate resets on gate failures (knee outside elbow, knees pinched, barrier leg passive).
  - Off-balance gate drill with posture-based variations (upright vs leaning vs combat base).
  - Scoop recovery drill (loss of under-knee control triggers immediate recovery before offense).
  - Entry ladder rounds: each rep must end in the same gated K Guard structure before any routing choice is attempted.

### 8.2 Week 2 — Volume 2: Backside Lane (Backside 50/50 Hub + Reaction Tracking)
- Primary outcomes to build
  - Route to backside when opponent orientation makes it available and stabilize backside 50/50 as the hub.
  - Maintain attachment through backstep/high-backstep reactions (follow hips, do not reset).
  - Add secondary threats (reverse Aoki) and conditional back exposure routes (matrix/X-hook) without forcing denied entries.
- Technical focus (hub + reactions)
  - Backside entry conditions and attachment priorities
    - Backside access is treated as a triggered lane; attachment precedes completion (do not lose hip connection chasing hooks).
  - Backside 50/50 as the hub
    - Enter off the K Guard structure after gates are won (off-balance + control).
    - If secondary leg is pinned/controlled, clear the pin before finalizing the hub.
  - Inside heel hook development from hub (control-first sequencing)
    - Stabilize entanglement before chasing heel exposure.
    - Use consolidation (double 50/50) when mirrored/contested rather than losing the exchange.
  - Backstep/high-backstep handling
    - Backstep is treated as a primary opponent reaction; follow hip rotation rather than letting separation reset the position.
  - Reverse Aoki branch (reaction-linked)
    - Use backstep timing as the trigger for grip/position changes described in the transcript (distance first; exposure without opening the chest; alignment cueing).
  - Matrix/X-hook routes (condition-dependent)
    - Matrix is treated as available only when behind-knee control is available; denial triggers routing change rather than forcing.
    - X-hook sequences used to create leg drag and back exposure with controlled build-up (no disconnected stand-up).
- Drilling progression (hub retention)
  - Backside 50/50 hub entry reps with a “secondary leg pinned” starting constraint (must clear before hub completion).
  - Backstep follow rounds: partner backsteps on cue; bottom must maintain attachment and arrive in a stable continuation.
  - Reverse Aoki reps starting from backstep trigger timing (distance-first and exposure constraints enforced).
  - Conditional entry drill: partner denies behind-knee hook; bottom must route away (no forced matrix attempts).

### 8.3 Week 3 — Volume 3: Frontside Lane (Angle-First Outside Leg Locks + Dilemmas)
- Primary outcomes to build
  - Route frontside when backside hooks are denied and achieve same-direction alignment as a hard gate.
  - Run outside-leg-lock threats (Aoki/outside heel hook) from a stable aligned hub with off-balancing to prevent heavy stepping.
  - Use threat cycling and leg-switch dilemmas to create sweep branches when defense over-commits.
  - Add heavy-base solutions (backroll prerequisite; saddle branch logic) when knee-lift stalls.
- Technical focus (alignment + dilemmas)
  - Frontside entry conditions
    - Denial signals trigger frontside routing (knee opened; behind-knee/matrix-style attachment unavailable).
  - Angle creation as the gate for outside leg locks
    - Same-direction facing treated as prerequisite; hip switching used to create the alignment while maintaining control grips.
    - Mobility constraint: excess tension in the non-driving leg is treated as a limiter to rotation; relaxation supports clean alignment.
  - Aoki and outside heel hook lines
    - Shared requirement: alignment first, control first, then finishing line selection.
    - Belly-down completion treated as a reaction-dependent completion path, not a default.
  - Off-balancing within the aligned hub
    - Forward/backward off-balancing used to stop the opponent stepping heavy and collapsing the position.
  - Threat cycling and leg switch
    - Cycling threats while keeping the hub (do not reset).
    - Leg switch as a dilemma that can branch to sweep when defense commits.
  - Heavy-base branches
    - Backroll sweep requires a posted hand; carry the knee through the roll.
    - Saddle branch framed as control transfer to far leg under heavy middle-leg pressure with hip lift and far-hip base placement.
- Drilling progression (gates enforced)
  - Angle gate drill: partner denies backside; bottom must achieve same-direction alignment before any finish attempts.
  - Off-balance integration: aligned hub maintained while running forward/backward off-balancing to prevent stepping collapse.
  - Threat cycling rounds: cycle between aligned threats without losing alignment; if alignment fails, reset to angle creation rather than forcing.
  - Backroll prerequisite drill: reps only “count” if the post condition is created first and the knee is carried through the roll.
  - Saddle branch reps with strict constraints (hip lift + far-hip base placement required before proceeding).

### 8.4 Week 4 — Volume 4: Upper-Body Overlay (Shotgun Armbar + Triangle + Reaction Punishments)
- Primary outcomes to build
  - Convert stalled lower-body progress into upper-body attacks without abandoning the structural connection that created the opening.
  - Execute shotgun armbar with the transcript’s key checkpoints (hip lift, armpit-foot shoulder control, alignment-first finishing).
  - Execute triangle setup/finish with head-control and placement constraints (knee pit to neck; angle creation before finishing; compression rules).
- Technical focus (reaction-based selection)
  - Upper-body trigger logic
    - Heavy base / stalled knee-lift battle becomes a trigger to branch to upper-body rather than forcing low-value rotation.
  - Shotgun armbar (core line + invariants across variations)
    - Hip lift to create space and isolate the elbow line.
    - Foot-in-armpit shoulder control to prevent extraction.
    - Finishing alignment set before ripping grips (orientation cues as described).
    - Maintain hip height until isolation is secure (avoid dropping hips early).
  - Triangle setup and finish
    - Head control treated as a retention rule (head-lift escape prevention).
    - Placement: knee pit hooks the neck line; leg must cover over the shoulder line.
    - Angle creation sequence: shin control + step on hip to create angle before closing.
    - Compression: knees point to the same side; remove gaps with correct leg/heel action rather than squeezing a loose configuration.
    - Arm position selection is treated as a risk trade-off (under-armpit lower risk vs under-leg higher angle/higher smash risk) as described in transcript.
  - Post/frame punishments (sweep/lock branches)
    - Posts/frames that appear during leg defense are treated as triggers for upper-body punishments rather than separate unrelated attacks.
- Drilling progression (branching under constraints)
  - Heavy-base scenario rounds: partner commits heavy base; bottom must choose upper-body branch and hit the defined checkpoints.
  - Armbar invariant reps: rotate through resistance/grip looks; finish must preserve the same isolation/alignment checkpoints.
  - Triangle finish checklist reps: head control maintained throughout; placement and compression constraints enforced.

- Coverage incomplete due to missing or insufficient transcript content.


## Annex A – Extracted Key Passages

- K Guard structural prerequisite
  - No K Guard progression is treated as valid without establishing the scoop grip / under-knee control connection.

- First battle framing
  - The knee-off-the-mat battle is treated as the first decisive gate; rotation-based offense is delayed until the opponent’s knee is lifted/off-balanced.

- Foot placement constraint for off-balancing
  - Blade-of-foot placement to the ribs is treated as the preferred off-balancing lever; if posture denies placement, space must be created first (knee shield) before re-placing.

- Combat base warning
  - “Going around” early against a combat-base posture is treated as structurally weak; change the structure (knee shield + come up / hip lift) before attempting to progress.

- Anti-collapse rule
  - Under-knee control (scoop) is treated as the primary anti-collapse mechanism that prevents the opponent from grabbing/stapling the leg into half guard.

- Supine guard principle
  - Pointing both legs in the same direction is treated as allowing the opponent easy two-hand control on both legs; asymmetry (one up/one down) is used to reduce early grip domination.

- Lasso as safety wedge
  - When the bottom-leg battle is lost, lasso is used as an immediate safety wedge to stop collapse and rebuild entry alignment back toward K Guard.

- Backstep as the central opponent reaction
  - Backstep is treated as the main problem to solve in the leg entanglement; prevention and follow mechanics are built specifically to deny clean disengagement.

- Backstep prevention cue
  - Turning the chest toward the mat and extending the lower body is used to reduce the opponent’s ability to freely backstep and re-base.

- Backstep follow constraint
  - When the backstep begins, attachment is treated as the priority; follow the hips through the geometry change rather than accepting separation and resetting.

- Reverse Aoki sequencing priorities
  - Distance creation is treated as the first requirement before heel exposure.
  - Heel exposure is created by moving the ribcage back rather than “opening the chest.”
  - Finishing alignment cue: thumb points toward the chest during the reverse Aoki configuration.

- Heavy base branch prerequisite
  - Back roll sweep is treated as unavailable until the opponent posts a hand; the post is created first, then the roll is executed.

- Back roll sweep retention cue
  - Success requires carrying the opponent’s knee through the roll (“take the knee with you”) to prevent the opponent stabilizing and staying on top.

- Saddle branch condition
  - When the opponent is very heavy on the middle leg and the primary knee-lift battle stalls, control is transferred to the far leg as the entry to the saddle branch.

- Saddle entry constraints
  - Hip lift is used to clear space for the leg travel and reduce smash pressure during entry.
  - A stable base on the far hip is treated as required; without it the saddle entry is smashable.

- Shotgun armbar entry logic
  - When heavy base stalls lower-body progress, hip lift is used to create the space needed to isolate the elbow line for the armbar.

- Armbar finishing alignment rule
  - Wrist/hand orientation is treated as a prerequisite for the finish; poor alignment allows the elbow to rotate out and survive.

- Triangle setup priorities
  - Head control is treated as a primary retention rule because head lift is a primary escape route.
  - Angle creation precedes finishing attempts (shin control + step on hip to create the angle).

- Triangle finishing mechanics cues
  - Knee pit placement must hook the neck line precisely.
  - Leg must cover over the shoulder line.
  - Knees point to the same side during compression to remove the finishing gap.


## Annex B – Terminology

- K Guard
  - Definition: An open-guard structure built around a primary leg connection and rotational mobility, with strict structural gates that must be satisfied before offense.
  - Usage context: Used as the core platform for routing into backside and frontside attack lanes and for branching into upper-body punishments when lower-body progress stalls.

- Knee-off-the-mat
  - Definition: The off-balance condition where the opponent’s knee is lifted from the mat, indicating their base is compromised enough to permit rotation-based progressions.
  - Usage context: Treated as the first major gate; if the knee is still planted/heavy, offense is delayed and structure/off-balance is rebuilt.

- Off-balance
  - Definition: A base disruption created by coordinated push/pull and alignment control, used to lift the knee and destabilize posture/stance.
  - Usage context: Built with blade-of-foot placement to ribs plus upper-body pull; if posture denies placement, a knee shield spacer is used first.

- Blade-of-foot placement
  - Definition: Using the edge of the foot as a firm lever on the opponent’s ribs to generate effective push for off-balancing.
  - Usage context: Preferred lever for the knee-lift battle; contrasted with weaker, less precise placements.

- Knee shield
  - Definition: A spacing frame created with the shin/knee line to keep pressure off and create the distance needed to insert stronger levers.
  - Usage context: Inserted when opponent leans forward/heavy and denies blade-of-foot placement; used to re-create the off-balance window.

- Scoop grip
  - Definition: Under-knee control connection used to anchor the opponent’s leg and prevent collapse into half guard.
  - Usage context: Presented as a non-negotiable control gate (“no K guard without the scoop grip”); loss of scoop triggers immediate recovery before attacking.

- Reverse scoop grip
  - Definition: A secondary under-knee control configuration used when standard scoop access is contested or when the opponent’s grip fight changes the leg angle.
  - Usage context: Appears as part of the secondary-leg/secondary-control layer that stabilizes structure and supports “go-around” progressions.

- Secondary leg / second barrier
  - Definition: The non-primary leg used as an active barrier to prevent stepping, stapling, and collapse while the primary connection and routing are built.
  - Usage context: Treated as a structural requirement; placement adjusts based on whether you’re winning the off-balance battle or defending against leg stapling.

- Knee hide (knee behind elbow line)
  - Definition: Structural rule keeping the bottom knee hidden behind the elbow line rather than flared outside.
  - Usage context: Treated as a guard integrity constraint; breaking this rule invites stuffing/collapse/counters during rotation attempts.

- Knee separation (anti-knee-pinch)
  - Definition: Structural rule keeping knees apart to preserve hip mobility and prevent easy collapse/disengage.
  - Usage context: Mentioned as a guard integrity constraint; pinching knees together is treated as making the position easier to shut down.

- Backside
  - Definition: Routing lane where you attack by accessing positions behind the opponent’s hip line as they turn away/run.
  - Usage context: Selected when opponent orientation exposes backside access; feeds the backside 50/50 hub and inside-heel-hook development.

- Frontside
  - Definition: Routing lane where you attack facing the same direction as the opponent, used when backside hooks are denied.
  - Usage context: Selected when the opponent opens the knee and prevents behind-knee attachments; built around angle creation for outside leg locks.

- Backside 50/50
  - Definition: A hub entanglement used to stabilize control and generate primary finishing lines in the backside lane.
  - Usage context: Central hub for inside heel hook threats and transitions; platform for following backsteps while maintaining attachment.

- Double 50/50
  - Definition: A stabilization/consolidation configuration used when the entanglement becomes mirrored/contested.
  - Usage context: Used to prevent escape and re-open finishing opportunities when direct lines degrade.

- Inside heel hook
  - Definition: Primary finishing family developed from backside hub control.
  - Usage context: Built with control-first sequencing from backside 50/50; includes alternate completion geometry when opponent rotation changes the line.

- Reverse Aoki
  - Definition: A complementary lower-body locking family used as a secondary threat in the backside lane.
  - Usage context: Often tied to backstep timing; includes explicit sequencing constraints (distance first; exposure without “opening the chest”; alignment cue).

- Backstep / high backstep
  - Definition: Defensive geometry change where the opponent steps around to clear entanglement or change alignment.
  - Usage context: Treated as the main problem to solve; requires either preventive structure (chest-to-mat + extension) or follow mechanics (stay attached and track hips).

- Chest-to-mat orientation
  - Definition: Turning the torso toward the mat to reduce the opponent’s ability to backstep freely and re-base.
  - Usage context: Used as part of the anti-backstep control response, paired with lower-body extension.

- Matrix
  - Definition: A backside control/transition route that depends on successful behind-knee attachment.
  - Usage context: Condition-dependent; if behind-knee hook is denied and only side-of-knee access exists, forcing it is treated as low value and routing changes.

- X-hook
  - Definition: A hooking configuration used to control the leg line and connect to leg-dragging and back exposure routes.
  - Usage context: Leads into leg drag and backtake progressions; requires connection maintenance during build-up.

- Leg drag
  - Definition: A dragging mechanic from X-hook control used to create back exposure and positional advantage.
  - Usage context: Treated as a route to back takes when the leg line can be controlled and moved across.

- Angle creation (frontside)
  - Definition: The process of achieving same-direction alignment with the opponent as a prerequisite for outside leg locks.
  - Usage context: Treated as the foundational gate in the frontside lane; achieved via hip switching while maintaining knee/ankle control.

- Same-direction alignment (“same way”)
  - Definition: Facing the same direction as the opponent, enabling structurally valid outside leg lock mechanics.
  - Usage context: Treated as a hard prerequisite; outside leg locks are considered low value without it.

- Aoki lock
  - Definition: Frontside outside-leg-lock family run from an aligned hub, with multiple finishing lines.
  - Usage context: Includes inside/outside variations and a belly-down completion pathway when opponent reaction presents it.

- Belly-down completion
  - Definition: Finishing orientation where the attacker rotates belly-down as part of completing a lock line.
  - Usage context: Treated as reaction-dependent rather than default; used when defensive rotation opens the pathway.

- Outside heel hook
  - Definition: Outside-leg-lock finishing family used in the frontside lane once alignment is achieved.
  - Usage context: Presented with inside/outside line switching based on defense while preserving the aligned hub.

- Threat cycling / combining submissions
  - Definition: Maintaining the same hub alignment while switching between finishing lines to create dilemmas.
  - Usage context: Used to avoid resets; the hub is preserved while threats alternate based on the opponent’s defense.

- Leg switch
  - Definition: A switching action that changes the leg configuration to create a dilemma between submission line improvement and sweep.
  - Usage context: Used when defense over-commits; can branch into sweep outcomes.

- Far Side K
  - Definition: A frontside control/transition concept that links into reverse X-style mechanics for sweeps and build-ups.
  - Usage context: Used as a positional bridge from K Guard attack structure into reverse X and wrestle-up style outcomes.

- Reverse X
  - Definition: A leg control configuration connected via Far Side K that manages base and supports sweeps/build-ups.
  - Usage context: Used to prevent step-through pressure and to enable controlled elevation and positional progression.

- Wrestle-up / build-up
  - Definition: A controlled rise from the guard while maintaining meaningful leg/hip connection to finish sweeps or take the back.
  - Usage context: Emphasized as “under control,” avoiding disconnected stand-ups that let the opponent re-face and clear.

- Back roll sweep
  - Definition: A heavy-base solution sweep executed via shoulder roll once the opponent posts a hand.
  - Usage context: Requires the prerequisite of a posted hand; success depends on carrying the opponent’s knee through the roll.

- Saddle
  - Definition: Alternate entanglement branch used when heavy base on the middle leg makes the primary battle low value, shifting control to the far leg.
  - Usage context: Entered via control transfer (middle leg to far leg) with hip lift and far-hip base placement as key constraints.

- Shotgun armbar
  - Definition: Upper-body submission line used as a punishment when lower-body progress stalls, emphasizing hip lift and shoulder control for isolation.
  - Usage context: Treated as the flagship upper-body branch; finishing requires alignment-first sequencing (hand/wrist orientation checks).

- Triangle
  - Definition: Upper-body submission branch used when armbar line is not available, emphasizing head control, placement precision, and angle creation.
  - Usage context: Includes explicit retention/finish constraints (knee pit placement to neck line; angle creation before closure; compression cues).

- Flower sweep
  - Definition: Upper-body-driven sweep branch that punishes defensive posts/frames.
  - Usage context: Triggered when the opponent commits a post while defending lower-body progress.

- Mirlock
  - Definition: Upper-body lock/punishment option presented as a reaction-based branch.
  - Usage context: Treated as an alternate response to defensive structures without abandoning the lower-body connection.

- Choibar
  - Definition: Upper-body submission branch included as an additional reaction-based option.
  - Usage context: Presented alongside shotgun armbar/triangle as part of the upper-body overlay.

- Lasso
  - Definition: A safety wedge structure used to stabilize when the bottom-leg retention battle is lost.
  - Usage context: Used as a bridge to rebuild entry structure and re-access K Guard rather than as an endpoint.


## Annex C – Additional Notes

- System spine is “gates → routing → outcomes,” not a linear technique list.
  - Gates are treated as hard prerequisites: if the gate is not satisfied, the solution is to rebuild the gate rather than forcing the next step.
  - Routing is treated as conditional and opponent-driven: backside is taken when available; frontside is used when denial signals appear.

- “No K guard without the scoop grip” is a governance rule, not a preference.
  - The scoop grip is framed as the primary anti-collapse control that stops the opponent’s easiest shutdown (grabbing/stapling into half guard).
  - Practical training implication: the moment the scoop is lost should be trained as an automatic state change (offense pauses; recovery sequence begins).

- Knee-off-the-mat is treated as the first battle that determines whether rotation is safe.
  - The system repeatedly frames knee-off-the-mat as permission to “go around.”
  - Practical training implication: build explicit training rounds where the only win condition is lifting the knee; no attacks allowed until the knee lifts.

- The “secondary leg barrier” is treated as a structural requirement with adaptive placement.
  - Secondary leg is not decorative; it is framed as the second barrier that prevents stepping and collapse while primary control is being built.
  - Practical training implication: include barrier-leg-only rounds where the partner’s primary goal is to step in and staple, and your goal is to keep the barrier functional while you rebuild scoop.

- Supine entry notes emphasize grip denial and asymmetry.
  - Pointing both legs in the same direction is framed as an error because it enables easy two-hand control.
  - Practical training implication: supine entry reps should start with the opponent trying to secure two grips; your job is to prevent it through asymmetry and framing before you attempt K Guard entry.

- Lasso is framed as a rescue wedge, not a separate system.
  - Lasso appears explicitly as a stabilizing bridge when bottom-leg retention is compromised.
  - Practical training implication: treat lasso as a “safety switch” sequence: if bottom-leg battle is lost, immediately stabilize with lasso, then rebuild the K Guard entry gates.

- Backstep is treated as the primary defensive macro-reaction that must be anticipated.
  - The system frames backstep as the main reason otherwise strong leg positions fail.
  - Two solutions are repeatedly indicated:
    - Prevention: body orientation and extension (chest-to-mat + lower-body extension) to reduce backstep freedom.
    - Follow: when backstep begins, maintain attachment and track hip rotation rather than accepting separation.
  - Practical training implication: run constraint rounds where the top’s only objective is to backstep and disengage and the bottom’s only objective is to prevent or follow without losing connection.

- Heavy base is treated as a branch trigger (not a reason to force the same battle).
  - When knee-off-the-mat cannot be won, the system points to heavy-base alternatives that have prerequisites.
  - Back roll sweep is explicitly condition-based: it requires the opponent to post a hand and requires carrying the knee through the roll.
  - Saddle is treated as a structured alternative that depends on control transfer and far-hip base placement.
  - Practical training implication: train heavy-base branches as conditional plays with explicit “availability checks” (post exists? far-leg capture available?).

- Upper-body overlay is framed as punishment for predictable leg-defense structure, not as unrelated attacks.
  - When lower-body progress stalls (heavy base/defensive posture), upper-body routes appear as high-value punishments.
  - Shotgun armbar is framed around isolation mechanics and alignment-first finishing; triangle is framed around head control and angle creation.
  - Practical training implication: include “stall-to-punish” rounds where the bottom’s only allowed attacks are upper-body branches once a stall trigger appears (e.g., inability to lift knee for X seconds).

- The system’s “do not” rules are execution-critical and should be treated as acceptance criteria.
  - Do not progress to rotation offense while knee is planted/heavy.
  - Do not attack without under-knee control (scoop).
  - Do not allow knee flare outside the elbow line.
  - Do not pinch knees together.
  - Do not expose heel by opening the chest in reverse Aoki contexts; expose by moving ribcage back.
  - Practical training implication: enforce hard resets when these violations occur to make the rules automatic.

## Annex E – Common Failure Patterns

- Attacking without under-knee control (scoop not established)
  - Failure pattern: attempting to rotate, “go around,” or finish while not connected under the knee.
  - Likely cause: skipping the control gate in favor of speed or because the leg is “there.”
  - What goes wrong: opponent grabs/staples the leg and forces half guard / collapses the structure.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - “No offense without scoop.” Treat scoop recovery as the immediate priority state change.
    - Rebuild distance with frames, then re-acquire scoop before re-entering.
  - Where it belongs in system: Structure gates (K Guard structure build) / scoop recovery drill.

- Trying to “go around” while the knee is still planted/heavy (off-balance gate not won)
  - Failure pattern: rotating around a stable kneeling base without first lifting the knee off the mat.
  - Likely cause: confusing “position achieved” with “permission to rotate.”
  - What goes wrong: structure collapses, hips get pinned, entries become weak and easily stuffed.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Run the off-balance gate first (blade-of-foot push + upper-body pull) until the knee lifts.
    - If posture denies foot placement, insert knee shield to create space, then re-place the blade of the foot.
  - Where it belongs in system: Off-balance gate drill (upright vs leaning vs heavy/combat base).

- Poor foot placement for off-balancing (blade-of-foot not on ribs when required)
  - Failure pattern: using a weak contact point so push/pull does not meaningfully lift the knee.
  - Likely cause: accepting “good enough” placement rather than rebuilding distance for correct placement.
  - What goes wrong: knee remains planted; attacker escalates force and loses structure.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - If the opponent leans forward and blocks placement, insert knee shield first, then re-place blade-of-foot on ribs.
    - Extend working knee away from chest to keep lever strong during off-balance.
  - Where it belongs in system: Off-balance gate variations by opponent posture.

- Bottom knee flares outside the elbow line (knee-hide rule violated)
  - Failure pattern: bottom knee drifts outside the elbow line while building/attacking from K Guard.
  - Likely cause: chasing rotation without maintaining guard integrity constraints.
  - What goes wrong: easier stuffing/countering/collapse as the knee becomes accessible and structure loosens.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Reset immediately when knee flares; rebuild with knee behind elbow before re-attempting rotation.
  - Where it belongs in system: K Guard structure gate drill (knee hide acceptance criterion).

- Knees pinch together (knee separation rule violated)
  - Failure pattern: knees come together during structure build, off-balance, or rotation attempts.
  - Likely cause: squeezing as a stability crutch, reducing hip mobility.
  - What goes wrong: opponent can disengage/collapse structure more easily; rotation and re-guarding become slow.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Maintain knee separation as a constant structural checkpoint; reset reps when knees pinch.
  - Where it belongs in system: K Guard structure gate drill / off-balance gate reps.

- Secondary leg becomes passive (second barrier disappears)
  - Failure pattern: secondary leg fails to act as a barrier while primary connection is being built.
  - Likely cause: focusing only on the primary leg connection and ignoring step-in/staple threats.
  - What goes wrong: opponent steps in, staples, and collapses structure before routing/attacks can happen.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Treat secondary leg as a required barrier: it must actively deny stepping/stapling while scoop is being built/maintained.
    - If barrier is compromised, rebuild barrier first, then resume progression.
  - Where it belongs in system: Structure gates / secondary-leg barrier concept.

- Supine entry error: both legs pointed the same way (easy two-hand control)
  - Failure pattern: presenting both legs in the same direction from supine and allowing opponent to secure two grips.
  - Likely cause: failing to apply the asymmetry principle early in the entry.
  - What goes wrong: opponent wins double grips, collapses retention, and prevents clean K Guard entry.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Keep asymmetry (one leg up, one leg down) to deny easy two-hand control.
    - Frame and break grips before attempting to enter K Guard structure.
  - Where it belongs in system: Supine-to-entry pathway / low-leg entry checks.

- Forcing matrix-style entry when behind-knee hook is denied (conditional entry ignored)
  - Failure pattern: attempting matrix routes without the required behind-knee attachment.
  - Likely cause: treating matrix as a universal answer rather than condition-dependent.
  - What goes wrong: low-value forcing attempts; loss of connection; opponent clears and re-faces.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - If behind-knee hook is not available and only side-of-knee access exists, abandon and route to a different lane (frontside/angle work).
  - Where it belongs in system: Backside lane conditional routes / routing denial rules.

- Losing the exchange on backstep (separation occurs instead of prevention/follow)
  - Failure pattern: opponent backsteps and you lose attachment, forcing a reset.
  - Likely cause: treating backstep as a surprise rather than the central defensive reaction.
  - What goes wrong: opponent disengages and escapes the entanglement; attack dies.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Prevention: chest-to-mat orientation + lower-body extension to limit free backstep.
    - Follow: track hips through the rotation and maintain attachment; return to best hub rather than resetting.
  - Where it belongs in system: Backstep prevention and backstep-follow drills.

- Reverse Aoki exposure error: “opening the chest” to expose heel
  - Failure pattern: trying to expose the heel by opening chest/leaning forward.
  - Likely cause: misunderstanding the exposure mechanic and prioritizing reach over structure.
  - What goes wrong: exposure fails; structure opens; opponent extends/clears.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Distance first.
    - Expose heel by moving ribcage back (not by opening chest).
    - Apply alignment cue given: thumb points toward the chest; finish by moving elbow back once exposure is achieved.
  - Where it belongs in system: Backstep-triggered reverse Aoki sequence.

- Back roll sweep attempted without the prerequisite (no opponent post)
  - Failure pattern: initiating the back roll sweep when opponent has not posted a hand.
  - Likely cause: skipping the availability check under heavy base.
  - What goes wrong: roll does not topple base; opponent stays stable and remains on top.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Create the post first (force the basing hand).
    - Only then initiate the roll.
  - Where it belongs in system: Heavy-base branch availability checks / back roll sweep drill.

- Back roll sweep retention error: failing to carry the knee through the roll
  - Failure pattern: rolling but letting the opponent’s knee line slip/free during the transition.
  - Likely cause: focusing on the roll itself rather than knee retention.
  - What goes wrong: opponent stabilizes and wins the post-roll battle; sweep fails.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - “Take the knee with you” as the non-negotiable retention cue.
  - Where it belongs in system: Back roll sweep key retention constraint.

- Saddle branch structural failure: entering without hip lift and far-hip base placement
  - Failure pattern: attempting saddle entry without creating space and without establishing base on the far hip.
  - Likely cause: rushing control transfer under heavy pressure.
  - What goes wrong: entry becomes smashable; opponent collapses and kills the branch.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Hip lift to clear space for transfer.
    - Control transfer middle leg -> far leg as the central action.
    - Establish far-hip base before proceeding.
  - Where it belongs in system: Heavy-base alternative branch (saddle) prerequisites.

- Triangle setup error: square finishing attempt without angle creation
  - Failure pattern: trying to close/finish the triangle while square, without stepping on the hip and creating angle.
  - Likely cause: treating closure as the finish rather than a checkpoint.
  - What goes wrong: limited choke mechanics; increased escape opportunities.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Create angle first (grab shin; step on hip).
    - Maintain head control to prevent the head-lift escape.
  - Where it belongs in system: Upper-body overlay (triangle branch) finishing gate.

- Triangle placement error: knee pit not hooking the neck line / shoulder coverage missing
  - Failure pattern: triangle is “closed” but lacks precise placement, leaving a gap.
  - Likely cause: imprecise leg placement and rushing compression.
  - What goes wrong: choke does not seal; opponent survives and begins posture/escape work.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Knee pit must hook the neck line.
    - Leg must cover over the shoulder line.
    - Finish with knees pointed to the same side and gap removal via correct leg/heel action (not squeezing a loose shape).
  - Where it belongs in system: Triangle finish mechanics checkpoints.

- Shotgun armbar finishing error: ripping grips before alignment is set (hand/wrist orientation wrong)
  - Failure pattern: attempting full extension and grip breaks without first setting finishing alignment.
  - Likely cause: prioritizing speed over alignment.
  - What goes wrong: elbow rotates out; opponent survives and extracts arm.
  - Corrective rules/cues
    - Set wrist/hand orientation first (alignment check), then break grips and extend.
    - Maintain hip height until isolation is secure.
  - Where it belongs in system: Upper-body overlay (shotgun armbar) invariant checkpoints.

- Coverage incomplete due to missing or insufficient transcript content.
