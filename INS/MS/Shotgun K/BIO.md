## 1.0 MASTER SYSTEM MAP

### 1.1 Legend / Conventions

- [HUB] = positional/decision hub
- (OUTCOME) = end state
- {OR} = primary branch
- A -> B = transition
- Abbrev: LB = lower body, UB = upper body, NS = north-south, RDLR = reverse de la Riva

### 1.2 How to Use This Map

- Read top-to-bottom as the default study order: Entry context -> K-Guard build -> orientation gate -> attack hub -> outcome.
- Use the “K-Guard build” node as the checklist: if attacks are failing, trace back to which build element is missing.
- Use the “Backside/Frontside gate” as the routing decision: pick the track that preserves angle and prevents getting squared/flattened.

        {OR} [RE-ENTRY -> K-GUARD BUILD]  (SWEEP TO TOP)  (SUBMISSION FINISH)

## 2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- K-Guard is treated as an open-guard attacking platform (primarily vs a kneeling opponent) designed to access lower-body submissions, upper-body submissions, sweeps, and back takes from one connected framework.

- The build is defined by “knee off the mat” structure + a scoop-style control on the near leg as the stabilising control that prevents the opponent from easily forcing half guard and collapsing the position.

- Entry families feed the same build and checklist: seated entries (lower-body and upper-body), supine entries (low-leg and lasso-style routes), and top-facing entries (north-south to K) plus reverse de la Riva to K.

- The main routing decision is an orientation gate: {OR} backside track {OR} frontside track, chosen to preserve angle on the leg line and prevent getting squared/flattened while maintaining submission access.

- Backside track concentrates around backside top/bottom control leading into 50/50 variants (including double 50/50) and continuation hubs that include following the backstep, high backstep routes, matrix, and X-hook pathways that connect leg attacks to back takes and positional advancement.

- Frontside track emphasises angle creation for outside-leg attacks, Aoki-style footlock variations, outside heel hook variations (inside/outside positioning), off-balance routes (forward/backward), and leg-switch dilemmas that reroute into stronger entanglements (including saddle) rather than forcing a stalled finish.

- Continuation is prioritised over single-attempt finishing: when the opponent backsteps, rolls, or resists, the system prefers following and re-entangling to keep angle and control rather than accepting a reset to a worse guard.

- Upper-body attacks appear as a branch when the opponent drives chest-to-chest or over-commits to upper-body pressure: shotgun armbar series, triangle setups/finish, mir lock, choi bar, and flower sweep function as punishments and alternative end states.

- The end-state targets are consistent across branches: {OR} (LEGLOCK FINISH) {OR} (SWEEP TO TOP) {OR} (BACKTAKE), with a recurring reset option of [RE-ENTRY -> K-GUARD BUILD] when the opponent’s reactions deny immediate completion.

## 4.0 CORE CONCEPTS

### 4.1 System Purpose and Default Environment

- K-guard is treated as an attacking open-guard framework that is most stable and most “complete” against a kneeling/combat-base opponent.
  - The position is designed to keep simultaneous access to:
    - Lower-body attacks (leg entanglements and leglocks).
    - Positional outcomes (sweeps to top, back exposure/back takes).
    - Upper-body attacks when the opponent’s pressure/engagement exposes the arm/head.

- Primary “system promise”: one connected guard structure that can attack multiple limbs without needing a full positional reset between families.
  - When one route is denied (angle/hip line blocked), the system routes to a different hub (backside/frontside/upper-body) rather than abandoning K-guard.

### 4.2 The K-Guard “Build” as a Non-Negotiable Checklist

- Core build idea: the guard is not “just a leg configuration”; it is a set of structural conditions that must be satisfied to prevent the opponent forcing half guard or collapsing chest-to-chest.
  - The build is repeatedly framed as a “battle” to maintain the structure before attempting major attacks.

- Knee-off-the-mat concept (structural prerequisite, not a stylistic preference).
  - If the opponent is able to pin/hold the guard-player’s knee and load weight, they can:
    - Lift and collapse the guard-player’s structure.
    - Reduce off-balancing capacity.
    - Create a pathway to forcing half guard / flattening.
  - A major early objective is to off-balance and/or shift the opponent so their knee/stance is disrupted and the guard-player’s structure can be re-established.

- Hidden-knee / elbow-shield alignment concept.
  - A recurring structural cue: keep the bottom knee “hidden” behind the elbow line so the opponent cannot easily win inside position and begin counter-passing.
  - The elbow line and knee position are treated as mutually reinforcing: if the knee is exposed, the opponent can connect to it and start collapsing the guard.

- “Do not put knees to the mat” principle inside K-guard exchanges.
  - The guard-player avoids configurations where both knees are dropped and the opponent can disengage, pin, or initiate passing pressure off the guard’s collapse.

### 4.3 Scoop Grip as Primary Control and Anti-Collapse Mechanism

- Scoop grip is treated as a primary stabilising control that prevents easy forced half guard.
  - Loss of the scoop grip (or leaving the controlling hand “empty”) is framed as a common pathway for the opponent to grab/connect and drive the guard-player into half guard.

- Scoop grip is not isolated from structure.
  - It is linked to:
    - Knee-off-the-mat battle.
    - Elbow/knee alignment.
    - Off-balancing actions that create time to secure the scoop and build secondary controls.

- If scoop grip is not immediately available, the system uses intermediate off-balancing/hand-fighting style actions to create access to the scoop rather than conceding the guard collapse.

### 4.4 Grip Layering and Hand Allocation as a System Constraint

- Grip selection is treated as a strategic layer, not a minor detail.
  - The guard-player aims to maintain “meaningful” hand use at all times (controlling the leg line, denying easy collapse, or progressing an attack).
  - An “empty hand” state is repeatedly associated with the opponent being able to connect, grab, and collapse structure.

- Grips are paired with the structural build.
  - The system treats grips as valid only if the underlying structure is intact (knee-off-mat, alignment, angle).
  - When structure degrades, the priority becomes rebuilding structure before forcing a finish.

### 4.5 Secondary Leg and Reverse Scoop as the Second Layer of Control

- Secondary leg control is a distinct concept from the scoop grip.
  - It is used to:
    - Maintain spacing and angle.
    - Prevent the opponent from freely stepping out, squaring, or disengaging.
    - Create a second control point so the opponent cannot solve the position by addressing only the primary scoop.

- Reverse scoop (as a secondary-leg concept) functions as a re-grip/angle-preservation tool.
  - It supports rerouting when the opponent’s alignment changes and the original grip angle becomes weaker.

- The system repeatedly treats secondary-leg control as a “guard integrity” tool: if the opponent starts to win the positional battle (squaring, driving, controlling), secondary-leg positioning is used to recover angle and rebuild the K-guard attack line.

### 4.6 Backside vs Frontside as a Routing Gate (Not Two Separate Guards)

- Backside/frontside is framed as the main routing decision that determines which hub is available and which attacks are mechanically aligned.
  - The guard-player chooses the track that preserves a strong angle to the leg line and avoids getting squared.

- Backside track: control and angle that supports 50/50 variants and continuation routes.
  - Central hubs include backside top/bottom orientation and 50/50-based control paths (including double 50/50).
  - The system treats following the opponent’s backstep as a continuation requirement rather than a “nice-to-have.”

- Frontside track: angle creation when backside access is denied or when the opponent’s positioning makes backside hubs less available.
  - The guard-player creates a frontside angle rather than forcing backside pathways that the opponent’s alignment is actively denying.
  - Frontside is strongly connected to outside-leg attack alignment and leg-switch reroutes.

### 4.7 Angle Management as the “Hidden” Driver of Success Across Both Tracks

- The transcript repeatedly frames success as “having the right angle,” not simply having a leg entanglement label.
  - Angle is treated as a practical constraint: if the angle collapses, entries and finishes degrade, and the opponent’s escapes/backsteps become easier.

- Hip-side commitment (staying on a chosen hip line) is used as a way to preserve the angle and prevent the opponent from stepping the trapped leg to the mat.
  - The system uses hip positioning and leg framing to deny the opponent an easy base, which supports both off-balancing and finishing alignment.

- When the opponent denies one angle, the system prefers rerouting (frontside/backside/leg-switch) over forcing a low-percentage finish.

### 4.8 Continuation Priority: “Follow” Reactions Instead of Resetting

- Backstep-following concept (especially emphasized in backside work).
  - If the opponent backsteps to relieve pressure or deny exposure, the system aims to follow and keep connection rather than letting the opponent fully disengage.

- Roll-following logic appears as a continuation mechanism to preserve angle and keep the attack sequence connected.

- Re-entanglement is treated as a legitimate system outcome.
  - If the opponent’s defence denies immediate finishing, the system routes back to a hub (backside hub / frontside hub / K-guard build) rather than abandoning to a neutral state.

### 4.9 Dilemma Stacking: Using One Threat to Force the Next

- Lower-body dilemma concept: the system connects footlock/heel-hook style threats to force predictable defensive reactions that open:
  - A different finishing alignment.
  - A sweep/backtake.
  - A safer re-entanglement route.

- “Combining subs together” is framed as a deliberate strategy (not improvisation).
  - The guard-player uses the opponent’s defensive sequence to move between aligned threats rather than repeatedly attempting the same finish.

- Leg-switch dilemmas are treated as systematic reroutes.
  - If the opponent denies the primary leg line, the system switches and re-routes into a stronger attack hub rather than staying stuck on a denied line.

### 4.10 Upper-Body Attacks as a Conditional Branch (Triggered by Resistance/Pressure)

- Upper-body attack access is framed as conditional: it appears when the opponent’s upper-body pressure/engagement creates exposures while trying to resist the lower-body system.
  - The upper-body branch is not framed as “separate”; it is presented as another limb-attack family that connects to the same guard structure.

- Arm isolation precision concept (shotgun armbar family).
  - The transcript emphasises precision on the elbow/wrist line and a clear thumb/hand orientation concept as part of making the armlock mechanically “clean.”
  - The armpit connection is treated as a control point that limits the opponent’s ability to escape once the arm is opened.

- Triangle and related attacks are treated as follow-on options within the same upper-body branch.
  - Upper-body attacks include multiple submissions and a sweep option that punishes defensive posture and creates a top end state.

### 4.11 Consistent End States and the “Return to Build” Option

- The system repeatedly resolves to a stable set of outcomes:
  - (LEGLOCK FINISH)
  - (SWEEP TO TOP)
  - (BACKTAKE)
  - [RE-ENTRY -> K-GUARD BUILD] when the opponent’s reaction denies immediate completion

- “Return to build” is treated as a valid decision.
  - Rather than forcing low-percentage completions when alignment is lost, the system prioritises rebuilding structural conditions and re-opening the routing gate (backside/frontside/upper-body).


## 5.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### 5.1 System Spine (What Must Stay True Regardless of Branch)

- Primary objective: use K-guard structure to keep continuous access to (a) leglock entries/finishes, (b) sweeps, (c) back takes, with a rebuild option when the opponent denies the immediate line.
- System continuity rule: when the opponent’s reaction denies the current attack angle (backstep, pressure-in, leg withdrawal, squaring), the priority is to maintain connection and reroute (backside/frontside/upper-body) rather than fully disengage.
- End-state set (recurring resolution targets)
  - (LEGLOCK FINISH)
  - (SWEEP TO TOP)
  - (BACKTAKE)
  - [RE-ENTRY -> K-GUARD BUILD] when alignment/control is degraded

### 5.2 Entry Families Into K-Guard (Where the System Starts)

- Seated entries
  - Seated -> K (lower-body emphasis): access the leg line and establish scoop/secondary control early so the opponent cannot immediately square and collapse.
  - Seated -> K (upper-body emphasis): use the same structural build but prioritise upper-body connection when the opponent’s base/pressure makes arm/head exposure likely.
- Supine entries
  - Supine -> K (low-leg): build directly onto the leg line when the opponent’s leg is accessible without needing a high upper-body tie.
  - Supine -> K (lasso-style): use a higher wrapping/anchoring configuration to create time/angle for the scoop and secondary leg placement.
- Top-facing entries (opponent over-commits forward / ends up above the hips)
  - North-south -> K: convert top pressure alignment into a K-guard connection rather than accepting a pinned/flattened configuration.
  - Reverse de la Riva -> K: use outside-leg framing to rotate into K-guard while keeping an angle that prevents immediate squaring.

### 5.3 K-Guard Build Requirements (The “Structural Gate” Before Attacking)

- Knee-off-the-mat requirement
  - The opponent’s ability to grab/pin the knee is treated as a primary collapse threat: if the knee is controlled, the opponent can lift, compress, and force a degraded position (including forced half-guard-type outcomes).
  - Practical consequence: if the opponent is controlling the knee, the system prioritises off-balancing and re-structuring before committing to deeper attacks.
- Scoop grip as a primary stabiliser
  - Scoop control on the leg functions as an anti-collapse anchor: losing it (or leaving the hand “unused”) allows the opponent to connect, square, and drive.
  - Scoop control is treated as “positional control first, submission second”: finishes and entanglements are layered after the leg is reliably controlled.
- Grip layer (hand allocation constraint)
  - Grip choice is treated as a constraint system: hands should either control the leg line, build the next control layer, or deny opponent connection; “empty” hands correlate with the opponent winning the collapse battle.
- Secondary leg / reverse scoop layer (second control point)
  - Secondary leg positioning is used to preserve angle, deny the opponent stepping out/squaring, and create a second problem so defence cannot be solved by addressing only the scoop.
  - Reverse scoop functions as a re-grip/angle-preservation tool when the opponent’s alignment changes and the initial scoop angle weakens.

### 5.4 Orientation Gate: Backside vs Frontside (Routing Logic)

- Backside/frontside is treated as a routing gate, not two unrelated guards.
  - Selection is driven by angle on the leg line and the opponent’s hip line (what remains available without getting squared/flattened).
- Backside track overview
  - Primary hub: backside top/bottom alignment that feeds 50/50-family entanglements and continuation routes.
  - Key continuity principle: opponent backstep is treated as a predictable reaction; following the backstep preserves the angle and keeps attacks connected.
- Frontside track overview
  - Primary hub: angle creation for outside-leg attacks and off-balancing routes when backside alignment is denied.
  - Leg-switch logic appears as a deliberate reroute mechanism to recover a better angle/entanglement rather than forcing a stalled line.

### 5.5 Backside Subsystem (Key Hubs and Connections)

- Backside hub components (as recurring “stations”)
  - Backside 50/50 and double 50/50 as entanglement hubs for inside heel hook access and re-attacks.
  - Follow-the-backstep as a continuity hub (maintain connection through the opponent’s attempt to change orientation).
  - Reverse Aoki routes (inside/outside) as finishing/pressure options connected to backside alignment.
  - High backstep as a specific continuation branch when the opponent’s backstep creates a new angle window.
  - Matrix as a transitional hub linking leg control to off-balancing/back exposure.
  - X-hook routes linking leg drag and backtakes as outcomes from backside control.
- Backside outcome routing
  - If finishing alignment is strong: pursue (LEGLOCK FINISH).
  - If opponent posture/base shifts to defend: convert to (SWEEP TO TOP) or (BACKTAKE) through matrix/X-hook branches.
  - If opponent escapes the current line but connection remains: [RE-ENTANGLE -> BACKSIDE HUB].

### 5.6 Frontside Subsystem (Key Hubs and Connections)

- Angle-for-outside-leglocks is treated as the frontside “entry gate”
  - The system prioritises creating/keeping the correct angle before committing to outside heel hook or Aoki-style finishes.
- Aoki lock variation set (inside / belly-down / outside) as a structured family
  - Variations are treated as response-driven: angle and opponent reaction determine which alignment is available without losing control.
- Off-balance branches
  - Forward and backward off-balancing function as outcome routes when the opponent’s defence denies clean finishing, converting leg control into top position.
- Outside heel hook variation set (inside vs outside alignment)
  - Selection is constrained by angle and exposure: choose the alignment that preserves control without allowing the opponent to freely square or peel.
- Combining submissions + leg-switch dilemmas
  - The system uses one threat to force predictable defensive reactions that open a second threat or a reroute.
  - Leg switch branches function as “angle recovery”: if the opponent denies the current leg line, switch and re-route into a better hub rather than persisting.
- Frontside transition hubs
  - Far-side K and backroll sweep as positional conversions when the opponent’s balance is compromised.
  - Saddle as a reroute hub when the leg-switch/angle battle produces a saddle-access window.

### 5.7 Upper-Body Subsystem (Conditional Branch From K-Guard Connection)

- Trigger condition
  - Upper-body attacks open when the opponent commits chest-to-chest pressure or over-engages upper-body control while defending lower-body threats.
- Upper-body hub attack families
  - Shotgun armbar series as the primary arm-isolation family.
  - Triangle setups -> triangle finish as the head/arm family when posture/arm position allows.
  - Mir lock as a shoulder-lock family available from the same upper-body connection window.
  - Choi bar as an armlock family accessed from the upper-body branch.
  - Flower sweep as the positional conversion option when submission completion is denied but the opponent’s base is compromised.
- Upper-body outcome routing
  - If limb/head exposure is clean: (SUBMISSION FINISH).
  - If opponent defends by posture/base reaction: (SWEEP TO TOP) or [RE-ENTRY -> K-GUARD BUILD] to re-open the lower-body tracks.

### 5.8 System Resets and Rebuild Triggers (When to Return to Build)

- Return-to-build is treated as a valid decision whenever one of the following occurs:
  - Knee control is being pinned/grabbed and structure is collapsing.
  - The scoop/secondary layer is lost and the opponent is squaring into a pressure pass line.
  - Angle is lost (squared hips) and finishing attempts would require forcing.
- Rebuild priorities (order of operations)
  - Re-establish knee-off-the-mat structure.
  - Re-secure scoop control (or re-angle to regain it).
  - Re-layer secondary leg / reverse scoop to lock the angle.
  - Re-open the routing gate (backside vs frontside vs upper-body) based on the opponent’s current alignment.


## 6.0 TECHNIQUE LIBRAR

### 6.1 Volume 1 – Basics

#### 6.1.1 K-Guard Build Checklist (Non-Negotiables)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have established a K-guard shape or are in the process of building it from seated/supine/top contexts.
- Primary controls
  - Scoop grip on the near leg is treated as the primary anti-collapse control.
  - Secondary leg placement is layered to preserve angle and prevent the opponent stepping/squaring.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Knee-off-the-mat is treated as a core structural requirement.
  - Bottom knee position must be protected (explicit cue given that the knee sits “behind the elbow” as a protective alignment).
  - Avoid “empty hand” states where the opponent can easily connect to your leg and force you into half guard.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Forcing you into half guard when you do not have the scoop grip / are not holding anything meaningful.
  - Connecting to/grabbing the knee and lifting/collapsing the position.
  - Squaring into you (winning the angle battle) to begin passing off your attack.
- Primary continuations
  - If you cannot immediately secure the scoop grip: use off-balancing actions to create access, then re-secure scoop.
  - Layer secondary leg to lock the angle, then route to backside or frontside based on the orientation gate.
- Abort criteria
  - If the opponent is controlling your knee to the point the structure is being lifted/collapsed, prioritise rebuilding structure rather than forcing attacks.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: right/controlling hand is not holding anything -> opponent easily forces half guard.
    - Correction cue: prioritise scoop grip; if not available, off-balance to create it, then re-grip.
  - Failure: bottom knee exposed/open -> opponent times counters and starts passing off your attack.
    - Correction cue: keep knee “behind the elbow” alignment.
- End state
  - A stable K-guard build that can route into backside/frontside attacks or upper-body branch when available.

#### 6.1.2 Scoop Grip (Anti Half-Guard Collapse Anchor)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You are in K-guard or transitioning into it and the opponent’s near leg is reachable.
- Primary controls
  - Scoop grip on the opponent’s leg (explicitly required in no-gi when you otherwise have “no grip” with the controlling hand).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Scoop grip is framed as the control that prevents the opponent from simply grabbing/connecting and forcing you into half guard.
  - The scoop grip is treated as a first-order requirement before trying to run deeper attacks.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - If you do not have the scoop grip: opponent can “grab the leg” and force you into half guard.
- Primary continuations
  - If you cannot grab it immediately: use “some kind of off-balance” to create the access window, then secure the scoop.
- Abort criteria
  - If the scoop grip is lost and the opponent is already collapsing you into half guard, prioritise re-framing/rebuilding rather than forcing the finish.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: not holding anything with the controlling hand.
    - Correction cue: “need that scoop grip here.”
- End state
  - Opponent’s near leg is anchored so you can build knee-off-mat structure and add secondary controls.

#### 6.1.3 Bottom Knee “Behind the Elbow” Alignment (Anti-Counter / Anti-Pass Cue)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You are in K-guard structure with scoop or while securing scoop.
- Primary controls
  - Positional alignment of your bottom knee relative to your elbow line.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The “main detail” is the position of the bottom leg; explicit cue: bottom knee sits behind your elbow.
  - If you keep it open/exposed, opponent can time counters and try to pass off your attack.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Timing the exposure to counter and initiate passing.
- Primary continuations
  - Rebuild knee-behind-elbow alignment before progressing to backside/frontside routing.
- Abort criteria
  - If your knee is being pinned/controlled while exposed, treat it as a structural loss and rebuild.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: knee open/exposed (not behind elbow) -> opponent counters/passes.
    - Correction cue: return knee behind elbow; reframe before attacking.
- End state
  - Protected knee line that supports stable K-guard build and prevents easy counter-passing.

#### 6.1.4 Knee Off The Mat Battle (Off-Balance First)

- Entry condition(s)
  - Opponent is kneeling/combat base and your K-guard structure is being contested.
- Primary controls
  - Off-balancing actions designed to lift/disrupt the opponent’s knee from the mat.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The “first battle” is framed as getting the opponent’s knee off the mat.
  - The concept is framed as prior to “any type of off balance” being meaningful; off-balance is used to win the knee-off-mat battle.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Grabbing your knee and lifting/collapsing you.
  - Staying heavy/stable so you cannot get their knee off the mat.
- Primary continuations
  - Use blade-of-foot + upper-body pull to create the knee-off-mat effect (explicitly stated as a method).
  - If you cannot create it from the current configuration, switch to knee-shield framing to re-establish leverage.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot off-balance enough to get the knee off the mat from your current configuration, switch to the described structural alternative (knee shield) rather than forcing.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: trying to “attack” before winning the knee-off-mat battle -> opponent grabs knee and lifts/collapses.
    - Correction cue: treat knee-off-mat as the first objective; off-balance first.
- End state
  - Opponent’s base is disrupted; K-guard build becomes stable enough to progress to grips/secondary leg/routing.

#### 6.1.5 Secondary Leg Placement (Angle Lock + Routing Enabler)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have primary control (scoop) and have placed the opponent’s knee on your chest (or have comparable connection).
- Primary controls
  - Secondary leg placed “on” the opponent (described as a consistent next step).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - “Every time I’m doing this, I want to put my secondary leg on …”
  - Secondary leg placement is directly linked to enabling routing: “You can either go for backside attacks or frontside attacks.”
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Using a “reverse …” (reverse scoop-type) response to win inside position and prevent you from placing your foot back on the thigh (described as a losing-battle scenario).
- Primary continuations
  - If you can place the secondary leg successfully: opponent cannot use the described reverse response in the same way; routing opens.
  - If you are losing the battle (cannot place foot back on thigh): control the opponent’s knee as the corrective action.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot re-place your foot/secondary leg and the opponent is winning the inside battle, prioritise the knee-control correction.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: opponent wins inside and you cannot put your foot back on the thigh.
    - Correction cue: control the knee to prevent them easily putting the knee outside and going around to pass.
- End state
  - Angle is preserved and you can route into backside/frontside hubs without getting squared/collapsed.

#### 6.1.6 Seated -> K-Guard (Lower Body Grips Entry)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You are seated and engaged in hand fighting, and you can connect under/around the opponent’s near leg.
- Primary controls
  - Priority cue: be “below the knee” (explicitly stated as the target region) so the opponent sitting on your hand is not structurally decisive.
  - Connection to the heel + hip movement (“bring my butt closer to that heel”) is used to initiate the K-guard shot.
  - A posting/controlling hand is used to stop the opponent’s foot from coming closer to your hips (explicitly described).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Do not accept the opponent forcing you into half guard or reverse de la Riva during the entry (explicitly warned as a risk if they come closer).
  - Entry includes a hip-connection step: opening the heel and bringing hips/butt closer before shooting K-guard.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Opponent stepping/coming closer to force half guard or reverse de la Riva.
  - Opponent sitting on your hand after you bend the leg (explicitly described as “okay” if you are positioned correctly).
- Primary continuations
  - Once you establish the entry, transition into the K-guard build checklist: scoop grip + knee alignment + secondary leg.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot stop the opponent’s foot from coming closer to your hips and they are forcing the half-guard/RDLR pathway, prioritise re-framing/repositioning before shooting K-guard.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: entering while allowing the opponent to step in close.
    - Correction cue: use the described hand to stop the foot from coming closer to the hips before the shot.
- End state
  - K-guard is established with immediate access to lower-body grips and routing options.

#### 6.1.7 Seated -> K-Guard (Upper Body Connection Entry)

- Entry condition(s)
  - Seated situation where you can secure some grip/connection on the opponent’s upper body while preparing to connect to the near leg.
- Primary controls
  - Upper-body grip is treated as “wise” before transitioning into K-guard.
  - You still require connection to the near leg (“I need connection to that near leg” is explicitly stated).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The entry includes opening a foot, bringing hips closer to the heel/foot, and extending the secondary foot while opening angle (described sequence elements).
  - If the opponent grabs your ankles, the response described is grip-breaking: grab the wrist and break the grip.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Grabbing your ankles to slow/stop your entry.
- Primary continuations
  - Break ankle grip by controlling the wrist as described, then re-establish hip-to-heel movement and near-leg connection.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot establish near-leg connection, do not “pretend” you have K-guard; prioritise reconnecting to the near leg.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: entering without near-leg connection.
    - Correction cue: explicitly re-connect to knee/ankle line before treating it as a live K-guard attack.
- End state
  - K-guard established with a clearer upper-body connection, enabling transitions into upper-body attacks later when pressure exposes them.

#### 6.1.8 Supine Guard Framework -> K-Guard Counter (Low Leg Retention Concept)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You are forced into supine guard (not ideal, but sometimes necessary) and need to counter back into K-guard.
- Primary controls
  - Leg orientation rule: do not point both legs in the same direction; place legs in different directions (“one leg up, one leg down”) to avoid easy control.
  - Grip framework: “one grip here, one grip here” to keep knees closer (self-framing mentioned when direct framing is not available).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Low leg guard retention is presented as the platform that allows countering into K-guard.
  - If you miss the low-leg retention battle, opponent can start going around your guard; framing and grip-breaking become required.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Taking two C-grips on your legs when both legs are aligned, controlling and initiating pass cycles.
  - Winning the battle against your bottom leg and moving around your guard.
- Primary continuations
  - Use low leg guard retention to come back to guard; from there counter into K-guard.
  - If opponent is going around, frame with upper body and break grips, then re-establish low-leg retention orientation and re-enter K.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot frame and your legs are aligned in a way that gives easy control, reset leg orientation before attempting K-guard.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: both legs point same direction -> easy grips/control.
    - Correction cue: “one leg up, one leg down.”
- End state
  - Re-established defensive structure that feeds a counter-entry into K-guard rather than remaining in a defensive cycle.

#### 6.1.9 Supine Guard -> K-Guard (Lasso Setup)

- Entry condition(s)
  - Opponent is kneeling, has won the battle against your bottom leg, and you need a safer anchoring method to restart offence.
- Primary controls
  - Lasso is used as the stabilising control to create safety and buy time to break grips and rebuild angle.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Lasso is framed as a way to become “safe” and stop the opponent from immediately running around the guard while you rebuild.
  - Once lasso is established, you break grips, then can push the opponent forward and eventually get K-guard.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Winning the battle against the bottom leg and initiating around-the-guard movement.
- Primary continuations
  - Establish lasso -> break grips -> push forward -> connect to leg line -> transition into K-guard build.
- Abort criteria
  - If lasso is not secured and the opponent is already going around, prioritise re-framing to get safe, then rebuild.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: bottom leg battle lost without a safety anchor.
    - Correction cue: “frame and put my lasso inside” to become safe, then rebuild.
- End state
  - A safer supine recovery that feeds into K-guard rather than prolonged defensive cycling.

#### 6.1.10 North-South Passing Pressure -> K-Guard Recovery Entry

- Entry condition(s)
  - Opponent is passing and reaches a north-south style top alignment; you cannot rely on arms alone to frame without fatiguing.
- Primary controls
  - Use at least one knee as a framing tool (explicitly stated) to reduce fatigue and create space.
  - Build distance, then insert the foot between you and opponent and place it to the inside / toward armpit line (explicitly described sequence).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Do not spend too much time with arms-only framing; switch to knees to frame.
  - Once foot is inserted between you and opponent, you are “in a much better position” and can immediately seek scoop grip to unbalance.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Sustained top pressure that tires out arm frames quickly.
- Primary continuations
  - Frame with knee(s) -> create distance -> foot insertion -> immediate scoop grip -> unbalance -> K-guard build.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot insert the foot between you and the opponent, continue to prioritise building distance rather than forcing the scoop.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: staying arms-only in north-south and fatiguing.
    - Correction cue: “use my knees to frame him.”
- End state
  - A recovery into a K-guard-connected structure with scoop grip access rather than remaining pinned.

#### 6.1.11 Reverse De La Riva -> K-Guard Entry (Distance First, Then Knee-to-Chest)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have a reverse de la Riva hook but you are too close to establish the bottom leg/hip placement needed to build K-guard cleanly.
- Primary controls
  - Framing with the top leg and arms to move the head away and create distance (explicitly described).
  - Knee-to-chest step: bring the knee closer to the chest after creating distance.
  - Extension step: extend the leg and look for the far hip (explicitly described).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - If you are “very close” it is hard to establish; you must first frame and move head away to create the distance window.
  - Sequence is repeated explicitly as the method: frame -> move head back -> knee to chest -> extend -> shoot for K-guard.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Preventing you from placing bottom leg on the hip when you are too close.
- Primary continuations
  - Use top-leg/arm frames to create distance, then run the knee-to-chest + extension sequence into K-guard.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot create distance, do not force the shot; keep framing and move the head away until the distance is sufficient.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: attempting K-guard entry while too close.
    - Correction cue: frame with top leg + arms; move head away first.
- End state
  - Clean transition from RDLR into K-guard with the distance and knee/hip alignment needed to progress into attacks.

#### 6.1.12 Secondary Leg vs Inside-Win Counter (Knee Control Correction)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have primary control (often scoop) and are attempting to place/maintain the secondary leg on the opponent to preserve angle.
  - The opponent is “winning inside” (using a reverse/inside position response) and you are losing the battle to re-place your foot on the thigh.
- Primary controls
  - Knee control on the opponent as the corrective control point.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - When the opponent wins inside and you cannot re-place the foot on the thigh, the correction is to control the opponent’s knee.
  - The knee-control prevents the opponent from easily putting the knee outside and “going around” to initiate passing.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Reverse/inside-win response that blocks your secondary leg returning to the thigh.
  - Stepping the knee outside and circling to pass when you lose the inside battle.
- Primary continuations
  - Control the knee -> re-establish the ability to place the secondary leg -> reopen routing to backside/frontside attacks.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot establish knee control and the opponent is already clearing your frames to pass, prioritise rebuilding the K-guard build checklist rather than forcing the secondary leg placement.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: repeatedly trying to re-place the foot without addressing the inside-win.
    - Correction cue: switch to knee control immediately when you recognise you are losing the re-placement battle.
- End state
  - Opponent’s pass-around pathway is denied long enough to rebuild secondary leg placement and re-open attack routing.

#### 6.1.13 Backside/Frontside Orientation Gate (Routing Choice)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have completed the K-guard build elements sufficiently to attack (knee-off-mat battle addressed, scoop/controls established, secondary leg layered).
- Primary controls
  - Orientation control that determines whether you are operating “backside” or “frontside.”
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The system explicitly frames “backside attacks” vs “frontside attacks” as the two routing options from the same build.
  - Orientation is treated as a gate: you do not commit to a leglock family until you are routed into the correct side with the correct angle.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Squaring to kill your angle and prevent clean routing.
  - Using inside wins to prevent secondary leg placement and block your ability to commit to either track.
- Primary continuations
  - If angle favors backside: route to backside top/bottom hub (then 50/50-style hubs).
  - If angle favors frontside: create/keep the outside-leglock angle and route to the frontside hub.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot hold angle long enough to route, return to build: restore knee-off-mat, scoop, and secondary leg layers.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: “choosing” a track without structure/angle and getting squared/passed.
    - Correction cue: treat routing as downstream of build; rebuild first, then route.
- End state
  - Commitment into the correct attack hub (backside or frontside) with stable angle/control.

#### 6.1.14 Backside Top / Backside Bottom (Positional Reference Hubs)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have routed to the backside track and are stabilising your orientation relative to the opponent’s hips/legs.
- Primary controls
  - Backside “top” vs “bottom” orientation control (treated as named reference positions).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The track is presented as having both “top” and “bottom” variations, implying the need to recognise which orientation you are in before selecting an entanglement/attack.
  - The backside hub functions as a staging area for 50/50-family connections and continuation routes (follow backstep).
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Squaring and clearing your angle to prevent backside stabilisation.
- Primary continuations
  - From backside hub: enter backside 50/50 family (Volume 2), or follow reactions (backstep) to stay attached.
- Abort criteria
  - If opponent clears your angle and you lose the backside orientation, reroute to frontside or return to build.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: treating backside as “one position” and losing orientation.
    - Correction cue: explicitly recognise backside top vs backside bottom as distinct hubs and stabilise before attacking.
- End state
  - Stable backside orientation that feeds backside 50/50 family and continuation routes.

#### 6.1.15 Frontside Top / Frontside Bottom (Positional Reference Hubs)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have routed to the frontside track and are stabilising your orientation relative to the opponent’s hips/legs.
- Primary controls
  - Frontside “top” vs “bottom” orientation control (treated as named reference positions).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Frontside hub functions as the staging area for outside-leglock angle creation (Volume 3) and off-balancing routes.
  - Top/bottom labels imply distinct orientation cues and transitions before selecting an attack.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Squaring and collapsing angle to prevent frontside stabilisation and outside-leg attack alignment.
- Primary continuations
  - From frontside hub: create the outside-leglock angle and select Aoki/outside heel hook/off-balance/leg switch routes (Volume 3).
- Abort criteria
  - If the opponent squares you before you establish the frontside angle, return to build or reroute backside if it becomes available.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: trying to finish without first building the correct frontside angle.
    - Correction cue: treat “angle for outside leg locks” as a gate; do not skip it.
- End state
  - Stable frontside orientation that feeds outside-leglock angle work and frontside attack families.

### 6.2 Volume 2 – Backside

#### 6.2.1 Backside Hub (Entry Point to Backside Attack Families)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have routed into backside orientation from the K-guard build (Volume 1 concepts), or you have followed the opponent’s backstep into backside alignment.
- Primary controls
  - Maintain backside connection and prevent the opponent from squaring out as you transition into entanglement hubs.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Backside is treated as a “track” with multiple hubs; the key is maintaining orientation and attachment through opponent reactions.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Backstepping and reorienting to break attachment and kill angle.
- Primary continuations
  - Enter backside 50/50 as a primary entanglement hub.
  - Follow backstep as a continuity requirement when opponent uses it to escape.
- Abort criteria
  - If you lose attachment and the opponent squares fully, return to K-guard build and re-route.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: letting the backstep create a full reset.
    - Correction cue: treat backstep as a predictable reaction; follow to stay connected.
- End state
  - Entry into backside 50/50/double 50/50 or continuation routes without losing the track.

#### 6.2.2 Backside 50/50 (Entanglement Hub)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You are in backside orientation and can connect into a 50/50-style entanglement without losing your angle.
- Primary controls
  - 50/50 entanglement as a hub that stabilises the leg line and enables inside heel hook access and continuation routes.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Backside 50/50 is treated as a named hub that supports multiple finishing and continuation branches rather than a single finish attempt.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Using backstep/rotation/defensive movement to deny exposure and force you to lose the angle.
- Primary continuations
  - Route into inside heel hook work from backside 50/50.
  - If the opponent changes orientation to deny exposure, follow backstep or roll to preserve connection.
- Abort criteria
  - If the entanglement is not stable and you are losing control/angle, reroute through continuation hubs rather than forcing a finish.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: treating the hub as “finish immediately” and losing connection when opponent rotates.
    - Correction cue: use the hub to maintain control; follow reactions to keep the system connected.
- End state
  - A stable entanglement platform that feeds inside heel hooks, double 50/50, and continuation routes.

#### 6.2.3 Inside Heel Hook (Backside)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You are in backside 50/50 alignment and have the exposure/alignment to attack the inside heel hook from backside positioning.
- Primary controls
  - Inside heel hook exposure controlled from backside alignment (specific finishing mechanics not provided in the supplied chapter list; keep to transcript-level framing).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The attack is framed as a backside-aligned inside heel hook option, implying that the exposure/angle is the enabling condition.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Rotational defence and attempts to change orientation to deny the heel exposure.
- Primary continuations
  - If the opponent’s reaction shifts you toward a frontside alignment, transition into the inside heel hook frontside option (as listed).
  - If the opponent backsteps to escape, follow the backstep to maintain connection.
- Abort criteria
  - If heel exposure is lost and control/angle degrades, move to continuation (follow backstep/roll) rather than forcing.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: losing the heel/angle and continuing to force the finish.
    - Correction cue: preserve angle first; reroute to the hub/continuation when exposure is denied.
- End state
  - (LEGLOCK FINISH) or a connected continuation into frontside heel hook, double 50/50, or follow-the-backstep hub.

#### 6.2.4 Inside Heel Hook Finishing Alignment (From 50/50-Style Control)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have entered a 50/50-style entanglement and can get your elbow/hand inside to connect to the heel line.
- Primary controls
  - Heel connection and shin-blocking alignment (block the shin with the belly as you create distance from the foot).
  - C-grip is used as part of the hand positioning before committing to finishing pressure.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Core finishing rule: move away from the foot to strengthen the breaking line (distance from the foot is treated as a universal heel hook rule).
  - Do not keep the foot “very close to the armpit” as the primary finishing alignment; you create a stronger configuration by moving away, then re-aligning.
  - Body placement uses a “sweet spot” between being fully on the elbow vs fully on the shoulder; you start on the elbow, then lean forward to load weight through the opponent’s foot while keeping the shoulder not fully flat.
  - Progression cue: before your shoulder fully touches the mat, extend and complete the breaking sequence (shoulder placement is a timing cue).
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Escaping by creating distance/extension and attempting to move away from the breaking line; defensive success is linked to you losing the “move away from the foot” alignment.
- Primary continuations
  - If the foot is close to the armpit, use C-grip and hip movement to re-position and create the shin-block-with-belly alignment, then re-apply lower-body breaking pressure.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot keep the shin block and your alignment collapses back into a “foot close to armpit” weak state, re-position before forcing the finish.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: staying too close to the foot (armpit-close) and losing strength.
    - Correction cue: move away from the foot; rebuild the shin block with the belly.
  - Failure: going “all the way” to elbow or “all the way” to shoulder without the sweet-spot load.
    - Correction cue: start on elbow, lean forward to load through the foot; only settle the shoulder as part of the timed completion.
- End state
  - (LEGLOCK FINISH) or re-position into a stronger finishing alignment without losing the entanglement.

#### 6.2.5 Double 50/50 (Backstep Stop + Re-Attack Hub)

- Entry condition(s)
  - Opponent is attempting to backstep out of your backside alignment and you need a stronger entanglement to prevent clearing.
- Primary controls
  - Knee-pit coverage and “knee-to-knee” alignment (your knee pit covers their knee pit).
  - Leg scissoring/pinching to prevent the opponent freely opening the knee and clearing on the backstep.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Control rule: you must pinch the legs; you cannot leave the knees open while trying to follow the backstep.
  - Angle rule: point the knee to the ceiling during the transition, then switch as the backstep happens; timing is “wait for that leg” as they backstep.
  - Transition rule: once you “cover knee pit with knee pit,” you can apply the same mechanics you used from backside 50/50 (double 50/50 is framed as an upgraded hub, not a different finish).
  - Standing opponent note: if the opponent is standing/tall, it becomes harder; the correction is to keep the knees close together and manage the far-hip hook/extension to preserve control.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Clearing by opening the knee during the backstep if your legs are not pinched/scissored.
  - Standing tall and creating space so your knee-pit control becomes harder to maintain.
- Primary continuations
  - From double 50/50: re-attack using the same finishing mechanics as backside 50/50, or follow the backstep again if they continue rotating.
  - If you stop the backstep and stabilise, you can switch grips (described: switching from heel grip to a C-grip on the ankle during the sequence) to maintain control through the transition.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot pinch/scissor and the opponent is clearing the knee line, re-attach to the leg line and re-enter backside 50/50 rather than forcing the double 50/50 transition.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: opening the knee while following the backstep.
    - Correction cue: pinch the legs; knee-to-knee; point knee to the ceiling as you switch.
  - Failure: leaving knees far apart vs a tall standing opponent.
    - Correction cue: bring the knees close together; preserve far-hip control and extension to keep connection.
- End state
  - A stabilised double 50/50 hub that denies the backstep and allows immediate re-attacks or continued following.

#### 6.2.6 Follow-The-Backstep (Attachment Rule + Timing)

- Entry condition(s)
  - Opponent initiates a backstep to clear your attack and change orientation.
- Primary controls
  - Pinching legs to stay attached while you “wait for the leg” and re-catch it as it travels.
  - Ankle catch to re-connect as the backstep opens the window.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Do not chase the backstep with open knees; the attachment is maintained by pinching and timing the catch.
  - The follow happens during the backstep: you track the direction they move and catch the leg when it presents (explicit “wait for that leg” cue).
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Backstep with knee opening and clearing if your legs are not pinched.
- Primary continuations
  - Re-catch the ankle as they backstep -> go deeper with the leg positioning -> transition into your chosen re-attack hub (backside 50/50 or double 50/50).
- Abort criteria
  - If you lose attachment and the leg clears completely, return to K-guard build rather than forcing a late chase.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: trying to follow while knees are open.
    - Correction cue: pinch legs first; then track and catch the ankle on timing.
- End state
  - Re-established entanglement (backside 50/50 or double 50/50) while denying the opponent a clean reset.

#### 6.2.7 Reverse Aoki (Heel Exposure + Two-Hand Reinforcement + Body Alignment)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have heel access during/backstep sequences and can secure heel exposure strongly enough to begin the reverse Aoki mechanics.
- Primary controls
  - Heel grip combined with a two-hand reinforcement concept (left hand assists/lifts the right hand to strengthen the grip and pressure).
  - Ribcage/back positioning to keep the heel exposure strong (explicit cue to move the ribcage back as part of exposure).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Exposure rule: exposing the heel “like this” is framed as much stronger; if the opponent is tall, you may need to move hips back as well to maintain the exposure.
  - Two-hand rule: every Aoki lock variation described requires using both hands; left hand supports the right hand to reinforce the finish.
  - Thumb orientation rule: for reverse Aoki, point the thumb to your chest and keep it facing your chest (this is repeated as a non-negotiable alignment).
  - Reinforcement rule: grab your forearm (not your wrist) as the finishing reinforcement; make a fist as part of the reinforcement detail.
  - Closing rule: close right shoulder and right elbow to the hip; put the right shoulder down while bringing right elbow to right hip (used to create tension through the foot).
  - Depth rule: do not be “too deep” in the configuration where the opponent’s knee structure reduces finishing strength; the transcript contrasts a weaker too-deep state vs a stronger adjusted alignment.
  - Finish rule: extend knees away from the body as part of the completion detail once the exposure and reinforced grip are set.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Escape concept mentioned: “turn and extend your leg” is described as the easiest escape from the reverse Aoki configuration.
  - Opponent height/space (tall posture) reducing heel exposure if hips/ribcage are not adjusted back.
- Primary continuations
  - If the opponent’s backstep is creating the heel window: catch heel -> use momentum to get to the elbow -> adjust heel position higher to the top side of the chest -> lift hips to create side alignment -> transition into the reinforced reverse Aoki finish.
  - If the configuration becomes weak due to depth/alignment: adjust exposure (ribcage back, heel position) before re-applying extension finish.
- Abort criteria
  - If you cannot maintain heel exposure with thumb-to-chest alignment and two-hand reinforcement, return to the controlling hub (backside 50/50/double 50/50) rather than forcing.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: grabbing the wrist instead of forearm when reinforcing.
    - Correction cue: grab the forearm; make a fist; keep thumb facing chest.
  - Failure: opening the chest / losing ribcage-back exposure.
    - Correction cue: keep ribcage back; expose heel first, then lock shoulder/elbow to hip.
  - Failure: being too deep where the finish feels weak.
    - Correction cue: adjust depth/alignment until the finish becomes strong; do not accept the weak state.
- End state
  - (LEGLOCK FINISH) or a controlled return to the entanglement hub with maintained heel exposure.

#### 6.2.8 High Backstep
- No transcript-derived content available for this technique.

#### 6.2.9 Matrix (Backtake-Oriented Hub + Lift/Stand-Up Choice)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have maintained backside attachment and can establish the matrix position as a control hub while the opponent reacts/turns.
- Primary controls
  - Matrix hook used to lift the opponent and preserve connection as you attempt to take the back.
  - Grip selection on the opponent’s leg/heel line (shallow vs deep is presented as a decision with trade-offs).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Lift rule: you lift your partner with the matrix hook to create the ability to take the back rather than staying static while they put their back to the mat.
  - Reaction-follow rule: if the opponent drops to the hip, you must follow; do not wait (timing is emphasised).
  - Two-grip decision rule: shallow grip vs deep grip are framed as different choices depending on outcome; shallow is framed as “probably better” for maintaining base and taking the back via crab-style control, while deep can compromise base.
  - Stand-up option: the transcript explicitly frames standing up and taking the back from a different angle as a desirable solution when needed.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Putting the back to the mat to deny back exposure if you do not lift/follow.
  - Dropping to a hip to change the alignment; success depends on your immediate follow.
- Primary continuations
  - From matrix: connect to X-hook position (explicitly framed as a strong connection) when the opponent’s movement creates the transition.
  - Use crab-style control for back take from the shallow-grip configuration.
- Abort criteria
  - If your base is compromised by grip choice (deep grip causing instability), revert to a shallower control that preserves base, or stand up to take the back from a better angle.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: waiting while opponent drops to the hip.
    - Correction cue: follow immediately; do not wait.
  - Failure: choosing grip depth that compromises base when your goal is back control.
    - Correction cue: prefer shallow grip when the goal is crab/backtake control.
- End state
  - (BACKTAKE) or transition into [X-HOOK HUB] while maintaining continuous control.

#### 6.2.10 X-Hook Hub (Transition From Matrix / Reaction Follow)

- Entry condition(s)
  - Opponent drops to the hip and you follow immediately, transitioning into the X-hook position.
- Primary controls
  - Immediate hip lift (momentum requirement) as the opponent drops; you “lift hips as well” to stay connected.
  - Removal/clearing of the opponent’s foot line as part of establishing the X-hook configuration (explicit cue: “get rid of that foot here”).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Timing rule: you cannot stay static as the opponent drops; you must use momentum and lift hips immediately.
  - Leg-placement options exist (knee hold vs ankle hook), and the transcript states both are valid; a preference is expressed for holding the knee as a control option.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Dropping quickly to the hip to make slow transitions fail (if you wait, you lose the window).
- Primary continuations
  - From X-hook: proceed into the “leg drop” sequence (framed as the first taught option from the hub).
- Abort criteria
  - If you fail the immediate follow and lose the connection, return to matrix controls or stand up to re-angle rather than forcing a late X-hook entry.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: staying in place when opponent drops.
    - Correction cue: lift hips immediately; transition on momentum.
- End state
  - A stable X-hook hub with access to leg-drop/backtake sequences.

#### 6.2.11 X-Hook “Leg Drop” (Leg Drag Outcome Family)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You are in X-hook and have chosen the shallow grip configuration needed for the leg drop.
- Primary controls
  - Shallow grip is used to enable the leg drop (explicitly stated).
  - Knee as base: knee placement is treated as the base-control variable that determines success.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Base rule: move your knee far away from the opponent’s hip to establish a reliable base for the leg drop; keeping the knee close is framed as problematic for base.
  - Control progression: the grip on the ankle transitions to the far hip as the sequence progresses (explicitly stated as a grip transition during the leg drop setup).
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Base disruption if your knee is too close to their hip during the leg drop attempt.
- Primary continuations
  - Use the leg drop sequence to progress into positional advancement/back exposure outcomes (titles indicate leg drag; transcript frames “leg drop” as the taught option).
- Abort criteria
  - If base is compromised (knee too close, instability), reset the base variable (knee farther away) before continuing.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: knee too close to opponent’s hip -> unstable base.
    - Correction cue: knee far away from hip; re-anchor base before the leg drop.
- End state
  - Positional advancement outcome from X-hook (leg drop/drag family) with maintained base and control.

#### 6.2.12 X-Hook Backtake 1

- Starting position / entry trigger
  - You are in matrix-style connection and the opponent starts dropping to their near hip.
  - Immediate timing rule: lift your hips as they drop; do not wait; use momentum to switch into X-hook.

- X-hook configuration (the backtake platform)
  - Two common hook placements are used:
    - Hooking behind/around the knee line.
    - Hooking the ankle line.
  - Preference detail: holding at/near the knee while using the foot on the inside line is presented as the preferred option for control.

- Control and base requirements before taking the back
  - Use a shallow grip initially to create/finish the leg-drop style stabilisation.
  - Build a strong base with the posting knee by moving it far away from the opponent’s hip (if the knee is too close to their body, you lose base).
  - Grip progression: the initial ankle control can transition to controlling the far hip once base is established.
  - Bottom-leg “escape” action is used to build into the leg-drop configuration (leg positioning that prevents easy turning-in).

- Stability rule inside leg-drop (to keep the backtake available)
  - Close the knee and open the foot to make it hard for the opponent to escape.
  - Opponent’s escape requirement is described as: step on the mat, open the knee, and turn to face you; your control aims to deny this by keeping the knee closed and foot open.

- Backtake mechanics (from stable X-hook / leg-drop)
  - Goal cue: expose the opponent’s lower back.
  - Hip placement cue: bring your butt very close to your heel; bring your knee very close to their body.
  - Finishing movement: kick with the lead leg and use a back-heel action with the trailing leg to rotate behind and take the back.
  - End state: you arrive in back control after the kick + back-heel sequence.

#### 6.2.13 X-Hook Backtake 2

- Starting position / scenario
  - Same X-hook / matrix-based entry context, but executed as a more dynamic backtake (including when the opponent is standing/moving).

- Timing and movement rule (same core constraint)
  - As the opponent moves to the hip line, you lift your hips with them and switch immediately into X-hook; do not pause in matrix while they are dropping.

- Foot / blade placement and angle management
  - Use the blade of the foot as a controlling wedge before initiating the backtake sequence (blade placement is used to stabilise the transition and keep the lower-back exposure pathway open).
  - Maintain the “expose lower back” objective during every micro-step (do not take the back by drifting away from the hip line).

- Hip and knee proximity cues (re-stated as the backtake engine)
  - Bring butt close to heel and knee close to the opponent to keep the rotation tight and prevent them turning to face you mid-transition.

- Clearing and stepping sequence (dynamic finish)
  - Use the lead leg to clear their leg line as needed, then step/move back with the base leg to complete the angle behind them.
  - Head-position constraint: do not keep your head too close; being very close with the head makes the movement harder to execute cleanly.

- End state
  - Back control is taken off the same X-hook platform, with the dynamic version emphasising step/clear mechanics and head-distance discipline.
 

### 6.3 Volume 3 – Frontside

#### 6.3.1 Angle For Outside Leg Locks (Frontside Gate)

- Entry condition(s)
  - Backside attacks are being denied because the opponent is standing/clearing the far hip/matrix line.
  - You can keep contact but need a higher-percentage route than forcing backside.
- Primary controls
  - Angle creation so you are not square in front of the opponent (frontside attacks require a “good angle” before committing).
  - Underhooking/going underneath as the recurring method to preserve angle when the opponent moves back.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - If you cannot access far hip/matrix/backside hubs, do not stall; route to frontside and build the outside-leglock angle.
  - When the opponent moves back, the system response is to follow and go underneath again to maintain the angle (do not accept a reset at long range).
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Standing posture + stepping back to deny far hip/matrix lines.
  - Clearing the grip/connection to force you square and disconnected.
- Primary continuations
  - From the frontside angle gate, route into:
    - Aoki lock family (inside / belly down / outside).
    - Outside heel hook family (inside angle / outside angle).
    - Leg switch branch when the opponent’s knee/hip line opens the window.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: staying square while trying to force outside heel hook/Aoki.
    - Correction cue: “create a good angle” and go underneath when needed; angle precedes finishing.

#### 6.3.2 Aoki Lock – Inside (Frontside Aoki Base Mechanics)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have frontside angle and heel access while facing the opponent (often after switching to outside ashi to face the same way).
- Primary controls
  - Maintain angle while facing the opponent; if the opponent is moving back, follow and go underneath to keep the angle.
  - Heel control is progressively refined:
    - Earlier method: inner side of elbow.
    - Current preference: control the heel with the middle of the forearm (improves control and reduces the opponent’s ability to “put the heel back inside”).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The heel must stay exposed; if the opponent can put the heel back inside, the attack collapses.
  - Upper-body alignment for exposure:
    - Move ribcage back to expose the heel when the opponent’s posture/space makes the heel hard to keep.
    - When needed, adjust hips back as well (especially vs a taller/standing opponent) to preserve exposure.
  - Grip options (two valid configurations)
    - Option A: primary hand controls the heel; secondary hand lifts/supports the primary to increase height/strength of control.
    - Option B: alternate secondary support that still preserves heel exposure and control; both are treated as viable if they prevent heel re-insertion.
  - Directional alignment cues
    - Head/shoulder line moves forward in the finishing alignment while the ribcage-back movement is used to expose the heel (exposure step precedes hard finishing tension).
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Putting the heel back inside to kill exposure.
  - Creating posture/space (standing) that reduces your ability to keep heel exposure without ribcage/hip adjustment.
- Primary continuations
  - If heel exposure is weak: ribcage back -> re-expose heel -> secondary hand lifts primary -> re-set forearm-heel control point.
  - If opponent moves back: follow -> go underneath -> re-assert frontside angle gate -> re-attack.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: accepting a shallow/low heel control that lets the heel re-enter.
    - Correction cue: elevate the primary hand with secondary support; maintain forearm-based heel control that blocks re-insertion.

#### 6.3.3 Aoki Lock – Belly Down (Weight-Above Trigger + Finish Direction)

- Entry condition(s)
  - The opponent’s body weight is directly above you and the standard line is compromised; the system routes to a belly-down finish direction.
- Primary controls
  - Use the same angle-preservation logic (go underneath / follow) to keep the heel line, then drop belly down as the finishing direction when weight is stacked above.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Belly-down is treated as a primary option when:
    - The opponent’s weight is directly above you (you need a different finishing vector).
    - You can keep heel access but cannot finish cleanly while staying square/under stacked pressure.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Stacking weight directly above to stall the standard finishing line.
- Primary continuations
  - If weight stacks above: route belly-down and immediately attack the belly-down Aoki line rather than forcing a weaker vector.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: trying to finish in-place while weight is directly above.
    - Correction cue: switch to belly-down finishing direction when the weight-above trigger occurs.

#### 6.3.4 Aoki Lock – Outside (Outside Ashi Facing Alignment)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You switch to outside ashi and face the same direction as the opponent, enabling the outside-Aoki alignment without losing angle.
- Primary controls
  - Outside ashi facing alignment + backheeling / going underneath as needed to preserve angle when the opponent moves/steps back.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - When the opponent attempts to step the foot to the mat (to stabilise/escape), deny that step by:
    - Maintaining the angle.
    - Backheeling and going underneath to keep the leg line controlled.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Stepping the foot to the mat to stabilise and clear the line.
- Primary continuations
  - Maintain angle -> deny the step -> secure Aoki control line -> continue to finishing or to off-balance branch when the opponent creates space.

#### 6.3.5 Off-Balance Forward (When Head/Weight Line Allows)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have two legs controlling and the opponent’s alignment allows forward unbalancing (head not “too high,” forward pressure line available).
- Primary controls
  - Two-leg control creates an easy forward unbalance when the opponent’s posture is available.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Forward unbalance is not always available; it is conditional on the opponent’s head/weight distribution.
  - If the opponent’s head is high and they are not moving forward, forward unbalance is not the primary answer (route to backward unbalance instead).
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Head high posture that removes forward unbalance opportunity.
- Primary continuations
  - If forward unbalance is available: use it to create a positional advantage for the next attack layer (reposition / leglock line).

#### 6.3.6 Off-Balance Backward (Default When Forward Is Denied)

- Entry condition(s)
  - Forward unbalance is denied because the opponent’s head is high / posture prevents forward loading.
- Primary controls
  - Backward unbalancing to create a reaction that opens repositioning and angle recovery.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - When forward is not available, backward becomes the setup:
    - “Unbalance backwards” to force the opponent’s step/clear reaction.
    - Use that reaction to reposition and re-establish the correct angle for the next attack.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Maintaining high head posture to prevent forward unbalance.
  - Clearing/stepping as the reactive defence once you unbalance.
- Primary continuations
  - Backward unbalance -> opponent clears/steps -> follow and create angle -> re-enter the frontside gate (Aoki / outside heel hook / leg switch).

#### 6.3.7 Outside Heel Hook – Inside Angle (Outside Ashi, Inside Angle Variant)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have inside angle from outside ashi and can begin outside heel hook collection.
- Primary controls
  - Foot distance rule: do not keep the opponent’s foot very close to your body when collecting (distance improves toe/heel control).
  - Upper body connection rule: move head closer to the opponent to strengthen upper-body connection.
  - Toe position rule: do not allow toes in the armpit (reduces ability to bend toes / lift heel effectively).
  - Grip options
    - Primary preference: a grip that moves the opponent’s foot farther from your body (reduces closeness and makes toe capture easier).
    - Alternate: C-grip on the ankle is listed as an option.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Thumb orientation: when catching the heel/toes, point the thumb to the mat (avoid catching with thumb facing the wrong direction).
  - Heel collection shape: close the elbow so the opponent cannot easily slip the heel; correct collection looks like the opponent is “stepping on” your biceps.
  - If elbow is open, heel slip becomes likely; elbow closure is treated as a non-negotiable.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Slipping the heel when your elbow is open or your collection is shallow.
- Primary continuations
  - If foot is too close: re-create distance -> capture toes with elbow -> collect heel -> close elbow -> apply lower body finishing pressure.
  - If heel begins to slip: re-collect with thumb-to-mat orientation and re-close the elbow.

#### 6.3.8 Outside Heel Hook – Outside Angle (Angle/Reaction Dependent)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have the outside heel hook line but the finishing choice depends on angle and the opponent’s reaction.
- Primary controls
  - Two primary finishing options are presented for heel hooks; selection is reaction/angle dependent.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Do not force one finishing method regardless of angle; choose based on:
    - Current angle you hold.
    - Whether the opponent is stepping back/clearing/turning.
- Primary continuations
  - If opponent steps back: follow and re-create the angle (go underneath again) before recommitting to the finish.
  - If angle is stable: proceed with the selected finishing option using the collection rules (toes not in armpit, elbow closed, thumb-to-mat).

#### 6.3.9 Combining Subs Together (Ankle Lock ⇄ Heel Hook ⇄ Leg Switch)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You are in a frontside leg entanglement and begin with an ankle lock line, but the opponent’s knee/leg reaction changes the available finish.
- Primary controls
  - Use the ankle lock threat to force knee/leg reactions that open heel hook or leg switch.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - When the opponent turns the knee inside during ankle lock attack, the response is to transition rather than stall.
  - The leg switch is treated as the bridge:
    - If you switch legs but “lose the heel” (heel slips), you do not freeze; you re-open the leg configuration and re-collect with correct angle.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Turning knee inside to nullify the initial ankle lock line.
  - Heel slipping when collection and elbow closure are not maintained.
- Primary continuations
  - Ankle lock attempt -> opponent turns knee inside -> transition (leg switch / heel hook collection) -> re-attack with correct angle.
  - Additional example shown: when the opponent opens the knee, leg switch leads to back takes and submissions (leg switch becomes a routing tool, not a single finish).

#### 6.3.10 Leg Switch – Dilemma (Open-Knee Reaction Tree)

- Entry condition(s)
  - The opponent opens the knee/creates a window while you are attacking from frontside.
- Primary controls
  - Switch grips and switch legs to redirect the leg line without losing control.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Leg switch is linked to multiple outcomes:
    - Immediate back take.
    - Backside 50/50 re-entry.
    - Inside heel hook re-entry.
- Primary continuations
  - Switch -> push opponent forward -> settle into the new alignment -> choose outcome (back take vs backside hub vs finish) based on the opening created.

#### 6.3.11 Leg Switch – Sweep (Push/Angle Conversion)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have switched and can push the opponent forward into a sweepable alignment.
- Primary controls
  - Push-forward action paired with the leg switch to place the opponent into a compromised base.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The push-forward is used to land in a position where you can:
    - Build up to the elbow.
    - Transition into reverse X guard build-up.
    - Finish or take the back depending on the opponent’s step/clear response.
- Primary continuations
  - Switch -> push forward -> secure ankle lock grip as an anchor -> build to elbow -> (sweep/back take/transition).

#### 6.3.12 Far Side K (Transition Option: Reverse X Build-Up)

- Entry condition(s)
  - From a leg switch alignment you can secure an ankle-lock style grip and place the opponent’s leg across your body.
- Primary controls
  - Ankle grip used as a temporary anchor while you place the leg across and begin to build.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The ankle grip is described as a way to slow/control while you change the leg’s position across your body.
  - The follow-up is a build-up sequence (reverse X guard mentioned as a build option).
- Primary continuations
  - Anchor ankle -> place leg across -> build to elbow -> reverse X guard build-up -> back take/sweep as the opponent reacts.

#### 6.3.13 Backroll Sweep (Heavy-On-Leg Trigger)

- Entry condition(s)
  - The opponent is very heavy on the leg line and you cannot lift them off the mat in the standard direction.
- Primary controls
  - Use legs (especially top leg) to push in a chosen direction to create the roll/sweep lane.
  - Shin push is used to steer the opponent’s weight.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The sweep requires taking the knee with you during the roll (explicit reminder).
  - The sequence emphasises immediate lifting of the leg during/after the roll to prevent the opponent winning the battle.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Heavy pressure on the leg that blocks standard lift-based entries.
- Primary continuations
  - Push with shin/top leg -> roll -> lift the leg immediately -> complete sweep to top.

#### 6.3.14 Saddle (Far-Leg Saddle When Opponent Is Heavy On Middle Leg)

- Entry condition(s)
  - The opponent is very heavy on the middle/primary leg and you are not able to lift it for the standard attack.
- Primary controls
  - Transition principle: take the saddle on the far leg when the middle leg is too heavy to lift.
  - Base requirement: strong base on the right knee (explicitly stated) to prevent being smashed/forced back to the hip.
  - Knee control + chest-forward line to prevent the opponent clearing and smashing the entry.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Do not accept a “saddle with one leg” configuration; it is framed as a losing state (opponent can put weight on you and smash).
  - Be close to the opponent’s ankle/hip line; if you are too far, it becomes easy to clear.
  - When extending the leg to create finishing/entry tension, simultaneously open and control the knee so the opponent cannot force you back on your hip.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Heavy pressure on the primary leg.
  - Smashing the saddle if your base is weak or you are on the hip.
  - Forcing you back on the hip by controlling your alignment if you are not close enough or not controlling the knee.
- Primary continuations
  - If middle-leg lift is denied: transition to far-leg saddle -> establish right-knee base -> secure knee control + chest forward -> proceed to attacks from saddle alignment.

### 6.4 Volume 4 – Upperbody

#### 6.4.1 Shotgun Armbar (Primary Setup: Elbow Exposure + Grip Break)

- Entry condition(s)
  - Upper-body exposure opens while you are in K-guard alignment and the opponent posts elbow/arm in a way that can be isolated.
- Primary controls
  - Two grip options lead to the armbar (both treated as valid; the “idea is the same”).
  - Highest-percentage entry is framed as starting by grabbing the opponent’s elbow, then breaking the grip as needed.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Elbow orientation rule: if the opponent’s thumb faces your back, it becomes easy for them to turn the elbow inside and escape.
  - Grip-breaking is treated as essential before you “put everything in place” for the finish.
  - Hip lift + elbow opening:
    - Lift hips to create separation.
    - Open the opponent’s elbow as part of preventing easy escapes and creating finishing alignment.
  - Depth control rule: do not let the arm get too deep (deep insertion makes escapes easier when you open).
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Turning the elbow inside to escape.
  - Escaping when the arm is too deep or the elbow is not opened.
- Primary continuations
  - Grab elbow -> open elbow -> break grip -> re-align hips and leg frames -> finish.
- Common failure patterns + correction cues
  - Failure: allowing the thumb/elbow to rotate into the “easy escape” orientation.
    - Correction cue: address elbow rotation early; open elbow and break grip before committing.

#### 6.4.2 Shotgun Armbar 2 (Knee-Off-Mat Denied → Hip Lift Substitution)

- Entry condition(s)
  - The opponent’s base prevents lifting the knee off the mat (the standard base-breaking route is denied).
- Primary controls
  - Substitute hip lift to create the same exposure and armbar alignment when knee lift is not available.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - When knee-off-mat is not attainable, do not stall; lift hips instead to create the armbar window.
  - Wrist placement requirement: adjust the wrist into the armpit correctly as part of completing the armbar structure.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Base stability that blocks knee-off-mat.
- Primary continuations
  - Hip lift -> wrist-to-armpit alignment -> finish or transition to the follow-up option when the first line is not there.

#### 6.4.3 Shotgun Armbar 3 (Escape Follow: Backheel + Shoulder-Close Finish)

- Entry condition(s)
  - The opponent begins to build up to the elbow and start escaping the armbar.
- Primary controls
  - Backheeling with the leg to keep connection and stop the escape.
  - Shoulder-close rule: keep the opponent’s shoulder close to the mat while re-entering the shotgun armbar finish line.
  - Supplemental control: shoulder-grip/crunch-like control (grip on shoulder) and shin-to-neck pressure to control posture.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - As the opponent escapes, you backheel to maintain connection and re-establish the shotgun armbar line.
  - Use shin against the neck and push head closer to the mat to stabilise posture for finishing.
  - Chest-to-triceps closeness is emphasised when breaking grips and rebuilding alignment.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Building up to elbow and escaping.
- Primary continuations
  - Escape begins -> backheel -> shoulder close to mat -> re-collect finishing position -> break grip -> finish.

#### 6.4.4 Flower Sweep (Scissor Finish From K-Guard Off-Balance)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You can off-balance the opponent over the head and have the leg positioning to initiate the scissor action.
- Primary controls
  - Scissor legs to rotate the opponent and come up on top.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The sweep is framed as applying the same core idea as prior off-balancing: off-balance first, then scissor and come on top.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Base stability; if off-balance is not achieved, scissor becomes harder to convert.
- Primary continuations
  - Off-balance over head -> scissor legs -> come on top.

#### 6.4.5 Mirlock (Middle Lock) (Overhook Control + Hips-Back Power Line)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You have an overhook-style upper-body connection from K-guard but need a submission line that does not collapse into the opponent turning your overhook into their underhook.
- Primary controls
  - Wide base creation + correct arm usage (power comes from hip/arm alignment rather than squeezing).
  - Step-on-hip distance management:
    - Step on the hip with the left leg.
    - Move hips back and lift the overhook very close to the chest.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Avoid allowing the opponent to resist in a way that turns your overhook into their underhook (this is framed as the key failure mode if alignment is wrong).
  - Elbow-to-knee spacing rule:
    - Do not keep the opponent’s elbow very close to your knee (creates an escape pathway).
  - Distance-building sequence
    - Hips back + overhook high to chest.
    - Use the left leg stepping on hip to maintain distance.
    - Bring the knee onto the chest to stabilise distance (distance is treated as a precondition for the lock).
  - Rib placement alignment
    - Move hips back until the opponent’s elbow is on your ribs (explicitly described as a key alignment cue).
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Resistance that converts your overhook into their underhook.
  - Closing distance by forcing elbow/knee proximity and collapsing your structure.
- Primary continuations
  - Create wide base -> hips back -> overhook high -> step on hip -> knee on chest -> elbow to ribs alignment -> apply the lock line.

#### 6.4.6 Triangle Setups (Grip Break → Shin-to-Elbow → Angle)

- Entry condition(s)
  - You can grab the head and create an angle from K-guard alignment; opponent is using grips that can be broken or redirected.
- Primary controls
  - Head control to anchor posture.
  - Knee insertion to the inside (knee goes in, then lift) to create angle and open the triangle lane.
  - Shin placement refinement:
    - Do not keep shin on the shoulder line when the grip is strong.
    - Slide shin to the elbow to improve leverage for breaking the grip and entering.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - Always create the angle before breaking the grip (angle first, then grip break).
  - If the opponent keeps the grip strong:
    - Transition shin from shoulder to elbow.
    - Use the knee lift to open the lane and reset the angle.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Strong grip that blocks initial triangle entry.
  - Defensive posture/base that prevents knee insertion if you try without angle.
- Primary continuations
  - Head control -> angle -> knee inside + lift -> shin to elbow if needed -> triangle entry alignment -> proceed to finish mechanics.

#### 6.4.7 Triangle Finish (Knee-Pit Hook + Knee Direction + Angle Extension)

- Entry condition(s)
  - Triangle is locked but finish is not yet secure due to angle/neck/shoulder placement variables.
- Primary controls
  - Neck capture quality:
    - Hook the neck with the knee pit (priority finishing detail).
  - Knee direction
    - Point knees to the top before squeezing (pre-squeeze alignment).
  - Angle creation method
    - Grab your own shin and step on the hip to improve angle.
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - If you do not hook the neck with the knee pit, the opponent can survive and it becomes hard to finish.
  - The “easiest escape” described is lifting up and escaping; maintaining side angle and knee-pit hook counters this.
  - Two control options during angle creation:
    - Maintain head control.
    - Or use arm placement control (armpit control) as a less risky option, with the trade-off that it is harder to create angle.
  - Before squeezing:
    - Point knees to the top.
    - Maintain head/angle control.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Lifting up to escape the triangle.
  - Gripping/positioning that prevents angle creation if you do not step and control properly.
- Primary continuations
  - Knee-pit hook -> knees point up -> step on hip and improve angle -> squeeze to finish.

#### 6.4.8 Choibar (Troy Bar) (K-Guard Variant With Distance Control)

- Entry condition(s)
  - The opponent gets chest-on-chest pressure on you during K-guard attack attempts; the armbar entry becomes available as a response.
- Primary controls
  - Shoulder control is prioritised during the switch into the Troy bar.
  - Leg positioning is used to maintain and control distance (right foot placement is described as enabling distance control).
- Structure rules / acceptance criteria
  - The Troy bar from K-guard is framed as different than “regular” Troy bar due to the distance-control requirements and how the opponent can otherwise create annoying defensive structure.
  - Knee closure rule
    - Close the knee; do not open it (closing is treated as essential to keep the structure stable and prevent defensive space).
  - Anti-escape alignment
    - Keep the shoulder close to the mat while you apply the finishing structure.
- Opponent main counters (as described)
  - Creating annoying defensive structure when you go to the “regular” variant without the described leg/distance control.
  - Catching their own side/positioning to prevent arm attacks (mentioned as a defence you must anticipate by controlling distance and shoulder line).
- Primary continuations
  - Switch from leg attack context -> control shoulder -> set right foot for distance -> close knee -> keep shoulder close -> apply finish mechanics.


## 7.0 DIAGRAM SET

### 7.1 Legend and Conventions

- [HUB] = positional / decision hub (a stable place to pause, assess, and choose a branch)
- (OUTCOME) = end state (finish, sweep, backtake, reset)
- {OR} = primary branch point (mutually exclusive primary paths)
- A -> B = transition
- Arrow labels = short labels only, used when the transcript provides a named link (e.g., “follow backstep”)

### 7.2 Master Macro Map (System Overview)

- Use this first: it shows the whole system as “Build -> Route -> Attack Families -> Outcomes -> Rebuild loop.”
- If anything fails, trace backward to the first broken gate (usually scoop grip, knee-off-mat, bottom knee alignment, or secondary leg).

### 7.3 K-Guard Build (Detailed Gate Diagram)

- Read this as “do not route until these are stable.”
- The diagram order is the practical order implied by the transcript: control first (scoop), base disruption (knee-off-mat), then protective alignment, then secondary leg to lock angle.

### 7.4 Entry Families Into K (Same Build, Different Starts)

- The key “use” is: regardless of entry, you always land back on [K-BUILD].
- If an entry fails, you do not “force” K; you correct the entry-specific gate (distance, grips, frames) and re-run the entry.

### 7.5 Backside Track (Volume 2 Spine) — “Backstep Is a Required Continuation”

- Primary “use”: decide what to do when the opponent backsteps to clear your backside alignment.
- The transcript’s emphasis: follow backstep; upgrade to double 50/50 when clearing is occurring; use matrix/X-hook as a backtake family.

### 7.6 Frontside Track (Volume 3 Spine) — “Angle Gate Before Attacks”

- Primary “use”: do not select Aoki/outside heel hook unless the angle gate is satisfied.
- The transcript repeatedly uses “follow and go underneath again” when opponent moves back to deny angle.
- Off-balance and leg switch are treated as structured reroutes when finishing is denied.

### 7.7 Upperbody Track (Volume 4 Spine) — “Pressure Creates the Branch”

- Primary “use”: when the opponent commits chest-to-chest pressure to shut down legs, route into the upperbody attacks rather than insisting on leglocks.
- This is a conditional hub: you do not force it when upperbody exposure isn’t there.

- This is the “do not accept a reset” diagram.
- When a line is denied, you pick the nearest named continuation hub instead of disengaging.

### 7.9 Quick “Debug” Map (What Failed?)

- If you’re getting passed: the failure is almost always a broken build gate (empty hand / knee exposed / no secondary leg / opponent wins inside).
- If you’re getting reset: you failed to run the continuation rule (didn’t follow backstep; didn’t re-angle by going underneath).
- If leglocks are denied by posture/pressure: route to off-balance or upperbody branch rather than forcing.

(Attack failing)
  -> check (Scoop Grip)
  -> check (Knee Off The Mat)
  -> check (Bottom Knee Behind Elbow)
  -> check (Secondary Leg Layer / Knee Control if inside-win)
  -> then choose correct hub: [BACKSIDE] / [FRONTSIDE] / [UPPERBODY]


## 8.0 APPLICATION SCENARIOS

### 8.1 Kneeling Opponent: Winning the First Battle (Knee Off The Mat)

- Situation cues
  - Opponent is kneeling/combat base and stable.
  - K-guard structure is being contested before attacks are available.
- Primary problem
  - If the opponent’s knee stays planted and they can connect to your knee/structure, they can lift/collapse and force you into a degraded guard (including forced half guard outcomes).
- Decision rule
  - If knee-off-the-mat battle is not won, prioritise off-balance and structural rebuilding over committing to submissions.
- Actions
  - Use blade-of-foot + upper-body pull to create off-balance that disrupts the opponent’s knee base.
  - Maintain scoop grip priority (do not accept an “empty hand”).
  - Re-establish bottom knee “behind the elbow” alignment before routing.
- Desired outcomes
  - Opponent’s base disrupted enough to complete K-guard build and open routing gate (backside/frontside).

### 8.2 Opponent Connects to Your Knee: Collapse Threat Management

- Situation cues
  - Opponent grabs/connects to your knee and begins lifting/collapsing the structure.
- Primary problem
  - Knee control by the opponent is a direct pathway to breaking the guard’s structural gate.
- Decision rule
  - If opponent knee control is strong enough to lift/collapse, do not force attacks; rebuild structure.
- Actions
  - Rebuild the knee-off-the-mat battle (off-balance first).
  - Re-secure scoop grip if compromised.
  - Restore bottom knee behind elbow alignment.
- Desired outcomes
  - Remove the opponent’s ability to lift/collapse; return to a stable K-guard build.

### 8.3 “Empty Hand” in No-Gi: Forced Half Guard Risk

- Situation cues
  - Your controlling hand is not holding anything meaningful during K-guard build.
- Primary problem
  - Opponent can connect/grab and force you into half guard.
- Decision rule
  - If controlling hand is empty, fix grip layer before attacking.
- Actions
  - Prioritise scoop grip immediately.
  - If scoop grip is not available: create “some kind of off-balance” to open the access window, then re-grip.
- Desired outcomes
  - Scoop grip re-established; anti-collapse anchor restored.

### 8.4 Opponent Wins Inside vs Secondary Leg: Knee Control Correction

- Situation cues
  - You are trying to re-place the secondary leg (foot back on the thigh) and the opponent wins inside with a reverse/inside response.
  - You are losing the battle to re-place the foot.
- Primary problem
  - If you cannot restore secondary leg placement, the opponent can step knee outside and circle around to pass.
- Decision rule
  - If you cannot re-place secondary leg due to inside-win, switch to knee control.
- Actions
  - Control the opponent’s knee to prevent easy knee-outside + circle-to-pass.
  - Rebuild secondary leg placement after knee control stabilises the line.
- Desired outcomes
  - Angle preserved; routing gate re-opens (backside/frontside attacks available).

### 8.5 Seated Entry: Opponent Steps Close to Force Half Guard / RDLR

- Situation cues
  - You are seated and initiating the lower-body K entry.
  - Opponent begins stepping/coming closer to your hips.
- Primary problem
  - Opponent proximity enables forcing you into half guard or reverse de la Riva during entry.
- Decision rule
  - If opponent is stepping close, stop foot-to-hip closure before shooting K-guard.
- Actions
  - Use the described posting/controlling hand to stop the opponent’s foot from coming closer to your hips.
  - Maintain “below the knee” focus so sitting on the hand is not structurally decisive.
  - Open the heel and bring hips/butt closer to the heel before committing the K-guard shot.
- Desired outcomes
  - Clean seated-to-K entry without conceding forced half guard/RDLR.

### 8.6 Seated Entry: Opponent Grabs Ankles During Upper-Body K Entry

- Situation cues
  - You are entering from seated with upper-body connection and the opponent grabs your ankles.
- Primary problem
  - Ankle grab slows/stalls the entry and can disrupt the hip-to-heel connection step.
- Decision rule
  - If ankles are grabbed, break the grip before continuing the entry sequence.
- Actions
  - Grab the wrist and break the grip as described.
  - Re-establish near-leg connection (explicit requirement).
  - Continue with hip-to-heel movement and angle opening (extend secondary foot while opening angle).
- Desired outcomes
  - Entry proceeds with near-leg connection intact; K-guard build can be completed.

### 8.7 Supine Scenario: Legs Aligned = Easy Two C-Grips and Pass Cycling

- Situation cues
  - You are forced into supine guard.
  - Both legs are pointed in the same direction; opponent can take two C-grips.
- Primary problem
  - Opponent controls both legs and can initiate pass cycles; bottom leg battle is lost and they can start going around.
- Decision rule
  - If legs are aligned, fix leg orientation before attempting to counter to K.
- Actions
  - “One leg up, one leg down” orientation to deny easy two-grip control.
  - Use grip framework (“one grip here, one grip here”) to keep knees closer when direct framing is not available.
  - If opponent begins going around: frame with upper body, break grips, re-establish low-leg retention structure.
  - Counter into K-guard once the defensive structure is restored.
- Desired outcomes
  - Defensive stability restored; path opens to supine -> K-guard counter rather than extended defence.

### 8.8 Supine Scenario: Bottom Leg Battle Lost → Lasso to Rebuild → K

- Situation cues
  - Opponent is kneeling.
  - Opponent has won the battle against your bottom leg and is starting to go around your guard.
- Primary problem
  - Without an anchor, opponent can run around while you are rebuilding, preventing clean K-guard re-entry.
- Decision rule
  - If bottom leg battle is lost and opponent is going around, use lasso as the safety anchor first.
- Actions
  - Frame and insert lasso to become safe.
  - Break grips from the safe anchor.
  - Push opponent forward, reconnect to the leg line, then transition into K-guard build.
- Desired outcomes
  - Safety regained; controlled rebuild into K-guard rather than guard collapse.

### 8.9 North-South Pressure: Arms-Only Frames Fatigue → Knees Frame → Foot Insert → Scoop

- Situation cues
  - Opponent is passing with north-south style top alignment.
  - Arms-only framing is tiring and unstable.
- Primary problem
  - Sustained top pressure burns arms; without a structural frame you cannot build the distance required to enter K.
- Decision rule
  - If arms-only frames are fatiguing, switch to knee framing to create distance.
- Actions
  - Use at least one knee to frame and create distance.
  - Insert the foot between you and the opponent, placing it to the inside/toward the armpit line.
  - Immediately look for scoop grip to begin unbalancing and re-enter K-guard build.
- Desired outcomes
  - Pressure broken; K-guard recovery entry achieved with immediate scoop access.

### 8.10 RDLR to K: Too Close to Place Bottom Leg on Hip → Create Distance First

- Situation cues
  - You have RDLR but you are very close; bottom leg cannot be placed on the hip cleanly.
- Primary problem
  - Being too close blocks the structural placements needed for K-guard entry.
- Decision rule
  - If too close, distance creation is mandatory before knee-to-chest and extension.
- Actions
  - Frame with top leg and arms to move the head away and create distance.
  - Bring knee closer to the chest after distance is created.
  - Extend the leg and look for the far hip as part of the entry sequence.
  - Shoot into K-guard build once the distance window exists.
- Desired outcomes
  - Clean RDLR -> K transition without forcing the entry at the wrong range.

### 8.11 Backside Continuation: Opponent Backsteps → Follow (Don’t Reset)

- Situation cues
  - You are in backside track and opponent initiates backstep to clear and change orientation.
- Primary problem
  - Backstep can create a full disengagement if you do not maintain attachment.
- Decision rule
  - Backstep is treated as a predictable reaction; follow it as a system requirement.
- Actions
  - Pinch legs (do not chase with open knees).
  - “Wait for the leg” and catch the ankle on timing as the backstep opens the window.
  - Re-establish hub: backside 50/50 or transition into double 50/50 to stop clearing.
- Desired outcomes
  - Backstep denied as a reset; re-attack hubs re-established.

### 8.12 Double 50/50: Stopping the Backstep Escape

- Situation cues
  - Opponent is attempting to backstep out and open the knee line; standard backside 50/50 is being cleared.
- Primary problem
  - If knees are not pinched/scissored, opponent opens the knee and clears.
- Decision rule
  - If opponent’s backstep is clearing the line, upgrade to double 50/50 with knee-pit coverage and pinch.
- Actions
  - Cover knee pit with knee pit; bring knees close together.
  - Pinch/scissor legs to deny knee opening.
  - Point knee to ceiling during the transition; time the switch as the backstep happens (“wait for that leg”).
  - If opponent stands tall: maintain knee-to-knee and manage connection rather than letting space break the hub.
- Desired outcomes
  - Backstep stopped; hub stable enough to re-attack with the same mechanics.

### 8.13 Frontside Angle Gate: Opponent Stands and Clears Far Hip / Matrix Lines

- Situation cues
  - Opponent stands/steps back and denies far hip control; backside matrix line is not available.
- Primary problem
  - Forcing backside when far hip/matrix lines are denied reduces control and can produce resets.
- Decision rule
  - If far hip/matrix lines are denied, route to frontside and rebuild the outside-leglock angle.
- Actions
  - Follow the opponent’s movement; go underneath again to preserve angle.
  - Establish “Angle For Outside Leg Locks” gate before selecting Aoki/outside heel hook branches.
- Desired outcomes
  - Frontside hub established with correct angle; attacks become viable again.

### 8.14 Off-Balance Selection: Forward Denied by High Head → Backward Unbalance

- Situation cues
  - You have two legs controlling but opponent’s head is high; forward unbalance is not available.
- Primary problem
  - Trying to force forward unbalance against high-head posture wastes time and loses momentum.
- Decision rule
  - If head is high and forward loading is denied, use backward unbalance as the default.
- Actions
  - Unbalance backward to force the opponent’s clearing/stepping reaction.
  - Use the reaction to reposition and re-establish the frontside angle for the next attack (Aoki/outside heel hook/leg switch).
- Desired outcomes
  - Predictable reaction forced; angle restored for next threat.

### 8.15 Saddle Entry Choice: Middle Leg Too Heavy to Lift → Take Far-Leg Saddle

- Situation cues
  - Opponent is very heavy on the middle/primary leg; you cannot lift it for the standard line.
- Primary problem
  - Persisting on the heavy middle leg stalls and risks being smashed.
- Decision rule
  - If middle leg is too heavy to lift, transition to saddle on the far leg.
- Actions
  - Establish a strong base on the right knee (explicit requirement).
  - Maintain knee control and chest-forward alignment so opponent cannot clear and smash.
  - Avoid “saddle with one leg” configuration (treated as a losing state).
  - Stay close (too far makes clearing easy); extend leg while opening/controlling knee to prevent being forced back to hip.
- Desired outcomes
  - Saddle established without being smashed; far-leg route replaces stalled middle-leg line.

### 8.16 Upper-Body Branch Trigger: Chest-to-Chest Pressure Opens Arm/Head Attacks

- Situation cues
  - Opponent commits chest-to-chest pressure while you are in K-guard structure, creating upper-body engagement.
- Primary problem
  - If you only insist on lower-body attacks, you miss the conditional upper-body openings created by the opponent’s pressure.
- Decision rule
  - When chest-to-chest engagement exposes the arm/head, route into upper-body hub attacks.
- Actions (attack family routing)
  - Shotgun armbar: grab elbow, break grip, manage elbow rotation (thumb orientation) to prevent turning elbow inside; hip lift and elbow opening as needed.
  - Triangle setups: create angle first; if grip is strong, slide shin from shoulder to elbow to break grip and enter; knee-in then lift.
  - Mir lock: create wide base; step on hip; move hips back; lift overhook close to chest; align elbow to ribs; avoid elbow-too-close-to-knee escape line.
  - Choi bar: control shoulder; set distance with foot placement; close knee; keep shoulder close to mat for stability.
  - Flower sweep: off-balance over head, then scissor legs to come on top.
- Desired outcomes
  - (SUBMISSION FINISH) or (SWEEP TO TOP), with a reset option back to K-guard build if the opponent’s defence denies completion.


## 9.0 DRILLING PROGRESSIONS

### 9.1 K-Guard Build Progression (Structural Gate First)

- Goal: make the K-guard “build checklist” automatic before routing to backside/frontside.
- Start position: open guard with opponent kneeling/combat base.
- Steps (loop)
  - Establish scoop grip (no “empty hand”).
  - Win the knee-off-the-mat battle via off-balance (blade-of-foot + upper-body pull concept).
  - Set bottom knee “behind the elbow” alignment.
  - Place secondary leg to preserve angle and prevent squaring/inside-wins.
  - If opponent wins inside and you cannot re-place the secondary leg: switch to knee control, then rebuild secondary leg placement.
- Terminal condition: you can hold structure long enough to choose routing (backside or frontside) without being forced into half guard or having the knee collapsed.

### 9.2 Entry-to-Build Progression (Named Entry Contexts → Same Checklist)

- Goal: reach the same K-guard build from multiple entry contexts without losing the structural gates.
- Loop the same “build checklist” after each entry.

- Seated entries
  - Seated → K (lower body): stay below the knee, connect to heel, bring hips/butt closer to heel, prevent the foot stepping close to your hips.
  - Seated → K (upper body): establish upper-body grip first, then secure near-leg connection; if ankles are grabbed, break grip via wrist control before continuing.

- Supine entries
  - Supine → K (low leg): avoid both legs pointing the same direction; use “one leg up, one leg down” to prevent easy double C-grips; rebuild to K when structure returns.
  - Supine → K (lasso): when bottom-leg battle is lost and opponent is going around, insert lasso to become safe, break grips, then push forward and rebuild to K.

- Top-pressure recoveries
  - North-south → K: switch from arms-only framing to knee framing, build distance, insert foot between bodies (inside/armpit line), then secure scoop and rebuild.
  - RDLR → K: if too close to establish, frame with top leg/arms to move head away and create distance; knee-to-chest → extend → shoot to K and rebuild.

### 9.3 Backside Continuation Progression (Backstep as the Trigger)

- Goal: treat the opponent’s backstep as a predictable reaction and maintain attachment into stronger hubs.
- Start position: backside hub / backside 50/50 access.
- Steps (reaction loop)
  - Opponent initiates backstep → pinch legs (do not chase with open knees).
  - “Wait for the leg” timing → catch ankle as it travels.
  - Re-enter backside 50/50 {OR} upgrade to double 50/50 when the backstep is clearing the knee line.
  - From double 50/50: knee-pit coverage + knee-to-knee pinch; re-attack using the same finishing mechanics.
- Optional branch: reverse Aoki exposure/finish details (thumb to chest, forearm reinforcement grip, shoulder/elbow to hip line, ribcage/hips back when needed to preserve exposure).

### 9.4 Frontside Angle Progression (Angle Gate → Threat Selection)

- Goal: angle creation is the gate; finishing attempts happen only after the angle is established/maintained.
- Start position: frontside hub (angle for outside leg locks).
- Steps (loop)
  - Create/maintain frontside angle; if opponent moves back, follow and go underneath again.
  - Select attack family based on what stays exposed:
    - Aoki lock (inside) → maintain forearm-based heel control; prevent heel re-insertion.
    - Aoki lock (belly down) when weight is stacked directly above.
    - Aoki lock (outside) when outside ashi facing alignment is established and opponent tries to step foot to mat.
    - Outside heel hook lines: keep toes out of armpit, close elbow to prevent heel slip, thumb-to-mat orientation when collecting.
  - If forward off-balance is denied (head high): switch to backward off-balance to force a clearing reaction, then re-enter the angle gate.
  - When knee/leg reactions open the window: leg switch to reroute into sweep/backtake/backside re-entry options.
  - If middle leg is too heavy to lift: take far-leg saddle with strong right-knee base; avoid “saddle with one leg” and prevent being forced back to hip.

### 9.5 Upper-Body Branch Progression (Conditional Punishment Tree)

- Goal: when chest-to-chest pressure/upper-body engagement appears, route into upper-body submissions without abandoning lower-body structure.
- Start position: K-guard alignment with upper-body exposure.
- Steps (routing loop)
  - Shotgun armbar line: grab elbow → break grip → manage elbow rotation (avoid easy “elbow turns inside” escape) → hip lift and elbow opening as needed.
  - If knee-off-the-mat route is denied: use hip lift substitution (armbar 2).
  - If opponent begins to build up and escape: use backheel connection + keep shoulder close to mat while re-collecting (armbar 3).
  - Triangle: angle first; if grip is strong, slide shin from shoulder to elbow to break grip and open lane → triangle finish cues (knee-pit hooks neck, knees point up, step on hip to improve angle).
  - Mir lock: wide base, step on hip, hips back, overhook high to chest; avoid elbow-too-close-to-knee escape line; align elbow to ribs.
  - Choi bar: control shoulder, manage distance via foot placement, close knee, keep shoulder close to mat.

### 9.6 Inside-to-Outside Roll-Through Drill (Position-Fidelity Ending Rule)

- Goal: stop “bad roll endings” where you roll but end in a weak alignment; ensure every roll ends in a usable attacking position.
- Start position: inside alignment before the roll.
- Core rule (explicitly stated): “every time you roll, you should end up in a good position.”
- Steps
  - Initiate the roll from inside.
  - During the roll, switch the legs so you finish on the outside (inside → outside transition).
  - Land with a finishing-ready upper-body posture (not fully on elbow, not fully on shoulder; settle into the “middle/sweet spot” posture used for strong pressure application).
  - Immediately connect and stabilise (bridge/hips-forward option described) so the end position is attack-capable rather than a transient stop.

## 13.0 TERMINOLOGY

### 13.1 Core positional terms

- K-Guard
  - A guard structure built around a strong connection to the opponent’s near leg (commonly via scoop control) plus a secondary-leg layer that preserves angle and prevents squaring.
  - Used as a routing platform into {OR} backside attacks, frontside attacks, or upper-body attacks when pressure exposes them.

- Backside
  - Orientation track where the opponent’s hip/leg line is controlled from the “backside” angle, feeding 50/50-family hubs, backstep-following, and backtake families (matrix/X-hook).

- Frontside
  - Orientation track where the system prioritises creating the correct angle for outside-leg attacks (Aoki/outside heel hook) and uses off-balancing/leg switching to maintain advantage.

- Backside Top / Backside Bottom
  - Named reference hubs to distinguish how you are oriented relative to the opponent when operating on the backside track, used to stabilise before committing to entanglement/attack.

- Frontside Top / Frontside Bottom
  - Named reference hubs to distinguish how you are oriented relative to the opponent on the frontside track, used to stabilise and satisfy the “angle gate” before attacking.

### 13.2 Structural gates and alignment cues

- Knee Off The Mat
  - A primary stability objective versus a kneeling opponent: disrupt their base so the knee is no longer anchored, enabling stronger angle control and safer attack entry.

- Scoop Grip
  - Primary lower-body control that prevents “empty hand” collapse and stops the opponent from easily forcing you into half guard while you build K-guard.

- Reverse Scoop Grip
  - A defensive/positional response that can win inside position against your secondary-leg placement, often forcing you to correct by controlling the opponent’s knee before re-layering your foot.

- Secondary Leg
  - The additional leg layer placed onto/around the opponent to preserve the attack angle, deny squaring, and open routing to backside/frontside tracks.

- Bottom Knee “Behind the Elbow”
  - A protective alignment cue for the bottom leg that reduces counter-timing and prevents the opponent initiating passing sequences off your exposed bottom knee.

- Inside Win / Winning Inside
  - Opponent’s success in taking the inside positional lane against your leg placement, commonly preventing you from re-placing your foot on the thigh and threatening pass-arounds.

- Knee Control (Correction)
  - A corrective control point used when you lose the inside battle and cannot re-place the secondary leg; controlling the knee prevents the opponent stepping knee-outside and circling to pass.

### 13.3 Entry context terms

- Seated To K (Lower Body)
  - Entry family where you connect to the near leg from seated (typically prioritising control below the knee/heel connection) before shooting into K-guard structure.

- Seated To K (Upper Body)
  - Entry family where an upper-body connection precedes the lower-body connection; still requires near-leg connection to complete a functional K-guard.

- Supine Guard To K (Low Leg)
  - Recovery/entry family from supine where low-leg structure and leg-direction management prevent easy grip control and allow re-entry into K-guard.

- Supine Guard To K (Lasso)
  - A safety-anchor recovery from supine using a lasso-style hook to stabilise, break grips, and then rebuild into K-guard.

- North-South To K
  - Recovery entry where knee framing and foot insertion between bodies create space for re-connecting to the leg line and rebuilding K-guard.

- Reverse De La Riva To K (RDLR To K)
  - Entry family where distance creation precedes the knee-to-chest and extension steps needed to shoot into K-guard without being too close to build structure.

### 13.4 Backside entanglement hubs and continuation terms

- Backside 50/50
  - A stabilising leg-entanglement hub on the backside track used to control the leg line and feed inside heel hook routes and continuation actions.

- Double 50/50
  - An upgraded 50/50-family hub used specifically to stop knee-line clearing during backstep defence; emphasises knee-pit coverage and leg pinch/scissor control.

- Inside Heel Hook (Backside)
  - Inside heel hook option accessed from backside entanglement/hub alignment.

- Inside Heel Hook (Frontside)
  - Inside heel hook option accessed after orientation/angle changes from backside work.

- Follow The Backstep
  - Continuation requirement when the opponent backsteps to clear: maintain attachment and recatch on timing rather than accepting a reset.

- Backstep
  - A common opponent reaction/escape attempt that changes orientation and can clear entanglements if you fail to maintain leg pinch and timing.

- High Backstep
  - A specific backstep variation referenced as a named chapter topic; treated as part of the backside reaction/continuation family.

- Reverse Aoki (Inside / Outside)
  - A finishing family that uses strong heel exposure plus strict hand/arm alignment and reinforcement concepts; appears as inside/outside variants tied to exposure and orientation.

- Heel Exposure
  - The state where the heel is accessible/isolated enough to apply finishing mechanics; maintaining exposure is treated as a prerequisite before committing to finish pressure.

### 13.5 Frontside angle, attack, and reroute terms

- Angle For Outside Leg Locks
  - The frontside “gate” concept: establish the correct angle before committing to outside heel hooks/Aoki lines; re-angle (often by going underneath) when the opponent moves back.

- Aoki Lock (Inside)
  - Frontside Aoki variant tied to inside alignment and heel control/exposure maintenance.

- Aoki Lock (Belly Down)
  - Aoki variant referenced as belly-down finishing direction, typically selected when weight/pressure alignment makes the standard vector low percentage.

- Aoki Lock (Outside)
  - Aoki variant tied to outside-facing alignment and denial of the opponent’s ability to step/plant the foot to stabilise.

- Outside Heel Hook (Inside Angle)
  - Outside heel hook option where the inside angle is retained; commonly emphasises collection quality (toe/heel control) and preventing heel slip.

- Outside Heel Hook (Outside Angle)
  - Outside heel hook option referenced as an outside-angle finish family; selection is tied to angle and opponent reaction.

- Off-Balance Forward
  - A setup branch that uses forward unbalancing when posture/weight distribution makes it available.

- Off-Balance Backward
  - A setup branch used when forward unbalancing is denied; backward unbalance forces reactions that reopen angle or transitions.

- Combining Subs Together
  - Threat-layering concept where one submission threat forces defensive reactions that open the next (e.g., ankle/heel hook dilemmas, or transitions created by knee reactions).

- Leg Switch
  - A reroute mechanism that changes which leg is attacked/controlled to create dilemmas, sweeps, re-entanglements, or backtakes when the opponent’s reaction closes the initial line.

- Far Side K
  - A named transition topic on the frontside track; used as an organisational label for a specific routing/position choice.

- Backroll Sweep
  - A sweep mechanic referenced as a backroll-based conversion when the opponent’s weight/pressure makes standard lifting/turning difficult.

- Saddle
  - A leg entanglement hub referenced as a finishing/position option; also used as a reroute when a leg is too heavy to lift and you shift to a different leg line.

### 13.6 Backtake and positional advancement terms

- Matrix
  - A backside backtake-oriented hub using leg hooks and timing (lift/follow) to prevent the opponent from dropping and denying back exposure.

- X Hook
  - A hook-based control hub linked from matrix sequences; used to stabilise and transition into leg-drag/backtake outcomes.

- Leg Drag (from X Hook)
  - A positional advancement family referenced as “X Hook Leg Drag,” typically involving base management and leg-line control to pass/advance.

- Backtake
  - Outcome node where the system converts entanglements and hooks (matrix/X-hook/leg switch routes) into back exposure and back control.

### 13.7 Upper-body branch terms

- Upperbody (Upperbody Hub)
  - The branch where upper-body attacks become available from K-guard context when pressure/engagement exposes arms/head.

- Shotgun Armbar
  - Armbar family referenced as “shotgun,” featuring entries, follow-ups, and escape-containment variants.

- Flower Sweep
  - Sweep family referenced as “flower sweep,” used as an upper-body-linked conversion to top position.

- Mirlock (also appears as “Middle Lock”)
  - Upper-body submission/control family referenced with both labels in the material; treated as a distinct attack option in the upper-body volume.

- Triangle Set Ups
  - Entry methods for triangle attacks, typically involving angle creation and grip management before locking.

- Triangle Finish
  - Finishing mechanics and alignment priorities after the triangle is locked.

- Choibar (also appears in transcript as “Troy Bar”)
  - Armbar/upper-body finishing family referenced with this transcript token; treated as a distinct upper-body attack option.

### 13.8 Grip and hand-position terms

- C-Grip
  - A hand shape/control reference used for controlling ankle/leg lines and stabilising transitions when standard grips are slipping or during re-collection.

- Grip Break (Wrist Control)
  - A defensive-to-offensive action where wrist control is used to remove an opponent’s ankle-grab or other stalling grip that blocks entry progression.

- Reinforcement Grip (Forearm vs Wrist)
  - A reinforcement choice referenced in finishing contexts (notably Aoki-family variants) where the forearm is used as the preferred reinforcement control point over the wrist in the described alignment.

### 13.9 Movement and timing cues

- Go Underneath
  - A re-angling method used to preserve attack angle when the opponent steps/moves back, particularly in frontside angle maintenance.

- Backheel (Connection Maintenance)
  - A leg action used to maintain attachment during opponent movement/escape attempts, especially in upper-body armbar follow-ups.

- Timing Window (“Wait for the leg”)
  - A timing cue for backstep-following: you don’t chase early; you track and catch as the leg travels and presents.


## 14.0 ADDITIONAL NOTES

### 14.1 System shape (how the pieces are meant to connect)

- The system is structured as a build-and-route framework rather than a single “move list.”
  - The K-guard build is treated as the prerequisite platform; backside and frontside are downstream routing tracks.
  - Upper-body attacks function as a conditional branch that appears when defensive pressure or engagement exposes arm/head lanes.

- The primary organisational spine used throughout the material is:
  - Build gates (stability and angle preservation) → routing gate (backside/frontside/upperbody) → attack families → continuation rules → outcomes → reset back into build.
  - Most “failures” are explained by a missing build gate or a broken continuation rule rather than “bad finishing.”

### 14.2 The build gates are the real “technique” under pressure

- Scoop grip is treated as a non-negotiable control layer in no-gi because an “empty hand” state allows easy collapse into half guard.
- Knee-off-the-mat is treated as the first battle against kneeling opponents; off-balancing is positioned as the tool that wins this battle.
- Bottom-knee “behind the elbow” is treated as a protective alignment that reduces counter-timing and prevents easy pass initiation.
- Secondary leg placement is treated as the angle-lock that makes routing possible; when it fails due to the opponent winning inside, the correction is knee control before attempting to re-layer the secondary leg.

### 14.3 Continuation rules are explicitly built into the curriculum (anti-reset logic)

- Backside
  - The opponent’s backstep is treated as a predictable and recurring defensive action.
  - Following the backstep is framed as mandatory; failure to do so yields resets.
  - Double 50/50 is presented as an upgrade hub specifically for stopping knee-line clearing during backstep defence.

- Frontside
  - Frontside attacks are gated by angle; you do not commit to Aoki/outside heel hook families without satisfying the angle gate.
  - When the opponent moves back, the corrective action is to follow and go underneath again to restore angle rather than accepting separation.

- Upper-body branch
  - Upper-body attacks are treated as the system’s “punishment layer” when leg attacks are being shut down by pressure or when the opponent over-commits to chest-to-chest engagement.

### 14.4 Common “why it stops working” explanations embedded in the material

- K-guard collapses into half guard
  - Typically explained by missing scoop grip (“empty hand”) or opponent connecting to your knee before you win knee-off-the-mat.
- Opponent circles around and passes
  - Often linked to losing secondary leg placement and allowing the opponent to win inside without applying the knee-control correction.
- Opponent escapes leglocks by clearing
  - Often linked to failure to follow backstep on timing, or failure to upgrade to double 50/50 when clearing is occurring.
- Frontside leglocks feel low percentage
  - Often linked to attempting finishes without first satisfying the angle gate (and/or failing to re-angle by going underneath when opponent steps back).
- Upper-body submissions fail to stabilise
  - Often linked to not solving grip-breaking and elbow-rotation/alignment prerequisites before committing to the finish.

### 14.5 Practical use notes (how to apply the document efficiently)

- Debugging approach under live resistance
  - When a sequence fails, diagnose by gates:
    - Build gates (scoop / knee-off-mat / bottom knee / secondary leg) first.
    - Routing gate second (did you choose backside vs frontside vs upper-body based on the actual opening?).
    - Continuation rule third (did you follow backstep? did you re-angle by going underneath?).
    - Only then evaluate finishing mechanics.

- Training emphasis suggestion consistent with the system
  - Spend early rounds on building and holding the K-guard gates long enough to make routing decisions.
  - Spend later rounds on “forced reactions” (opponent backsteps; opponent steps back; opponent pressures chest-to-chest) and demonstrate the correct continuation branch without pausing.

### 14.6 High-level framing statements (from Intro)

- K-guard is positioned as a top-tier guard choice within the overall guard “hierarchy” used in practice, specifically highlighted as reliable against high-level opponents.
- Core claim of the system: K-guard is not limited to lower-body attacks; it is explicitly framed as a platform to attack every limb (leg attacks plus integrated upper-body attacks).
- The system emphasis is on building repeatable “connection types” that keep you attached to the opponent through common defensive movements, so the guard remains offensive instead of collapsing into a purely defensive shell.
