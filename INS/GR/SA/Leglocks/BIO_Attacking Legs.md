## 4.0 CORE CONCEPTS

### 4.1 Finishing competence must exist on both heel-hook sides (inside + outside)

- Inside heel hooks are treated as mechanically high-percentage, but the system explicitly requires you to be able to finish from both inside and outside heel-hook contexts.
  - If you can only finish one side, the opponent can steer exchanges into the side you cannot finish and reduce your overall effectiveness.
- The “finish both sides” requirement is framed as a strategic constraint: positional choices, pummeling, and transitions must preserve access to at least one credible breaking direction.

### 4.2 The inside-position battle is the first gate to winning leg-lock exchanges

- Inside position is defined as keeping your feet and knees inside the opponent’s feet and knees.
  - When your legs occupy the inside lane, you can access their legs while simultaneously blocking their access to yours.
- Exchange rule: winning inside position precedes meaningful offense.
  - If inside position is not clearly won, the immediate task is pummeling and re-organization before committing to finishing attempts.
- Inside position is treated as a positional “permission slip” for attack initiation, not a minor detail.

### 4.3 Control sequencing: inside position → knee-line/hip control → exposure → breaking mechanics

- The system repeatedly enforces a sequence rather than “submission-first” thinking.
  - Inside position establishes access and denial.
  - Control layers stabilize the entanglement so exposure can be created without giving the opponent an easy clear/escape.
  - Exposure is then converted into breaking mechanics rather than forcing breaks from poor alignment.
- Practical implication: when finishes fail, the error is often a skipped layer (attempting to break before exposure, or attempting exposure before stabilizing control).

### 4.4 Dilemma architecture is the engine (not single-technique attempts)

- Achilles ↔ heel hook is presented as a recurring forcing dilemma.
  - The objective is to create a situation where defending one line predictably opens the other line.
- Later volumes extend dilemma logic into toe-hold-driven dilemmas (toe hold ↔ heel hook; toe hold ↔ separation) to prevent opponents from choosing “safe” defensive lines.

### 4.5 Heel exposure is built through specific control tools, not wishful pulling

- Exposure is treated as a constructed state: you create it by controlling hips, knee line, and the opponent’s ability to rotate/clear.
- Outside-ashi emphasizes controlling the hips as the route to reliable heel exposure while preventing the opponent from escaping by turning away and exposing your back.
- Multiple exposure formats are treated as distinct pathways (belly-up vs belly-down exposures), each with different control requirements and finish vectors.

### 4.6 Back-exposure denial is a non-negotiable constraint in outside-ashi

- Outside-ashi offense is paired with explicit constraints to deny back exposure.
  - Control choices are evaluated by whether they keep you safe from the opponent turning away and taking your back during exposure/finishing attempts.
- Practical implication: if you can expose the heel but your structure gives the opponent a clear path to your back, the exposure pathway is treated as incorrect or incomplete.

### 4.7 Rolling is an expected defensive tool; continuity must be built into the system

- Defensive rolling is assumed; the system includes explicit “follow” and “switch” concepts to maintain attachment through rotation.
- Single-roll theory provides a framework for when and how the opponent’s roll resolves, and how you stay connected without being pulled into poor alignment.
- Follow-the-leg and switching-legs concepts are treated as continuity tools:
  - If the target leg clears, re-attach to the other leg or re-entangle rather than accepting a reset.

### 4.8 Heel slip is treated as a recurring defensive problem with explicit counters

- Heel slippage is presented as a realistic defensive response during finishing.
- The system includes specific counter families (high-hands recovery and roll-through recovery) to re-secure the heel and preserve breaking alignment when the heel begins to escape.

### 4.9 Cross-ashi is defined by leg-position structure and pummeling, with predictable problem sets

- Cross-ashi is introduced with explicit leg-position definitions and predictable “issues” that must be solved.
- The system uses leg pummeling as the core method to improve position and re-open exposure routes rather than forcing attacks from a losing configuration.
- Cross-ashi offense is framed as a progression:
  - Achilles-based threats and figure-4 structures → transitions into heel-hook exposure → lace/dracula families → follow-the-roll continuation to prevent escapes.

### 4.10 Passing-the-leg and dual-heel exposure are treated as strategic upgrades (not “extra moves”)

- Passing a leg (including 2-on-1 ankle control and dracula-family passing variants) is used to improve the exposure and control landscape.
- Dual-heel exposure is treated as a meaningful escalation: controlling both heels increases constraint on the opponent and improves your ability to force a breaking decision.

### 4.11 50/50 and mutual entanglements require explicit priority rules (hand fighting and “going last”)

- 50/50 is treated as a hand-fighting and separation problem, not simply a leg-entanglement “position you arrive in.”
  - Grip battles and separation dilemmas dictate whether attacks can be launched safely.
- Mutual ashi is presented as an entanglement where priority rules matter.
  - “Going last” is framed as a key concept: sequencing and timing determine who wins exchanges when both players have comparable access.

### 4.12 “Stress test” thinking: mechanics must survive resistance checks

- Stress tests are used to validate that:
  - inside position is truly won,
  - the entanglement is tight enough to deny clearing/extraction,
  - exposure can be achieved without giving back exposure,
  - breaking mechanics remain available under active defense (rolls, heel slip, posture changes).

## 5.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### 5.1 System objective and constraints (what the system is optimizing for)

- Win leg-lock exchanges by consistently creating positions where you can attack their legs while they have reduced access to your legs (asymmetry preference).
- Treat symmetrical entanglements (notably 50/50) as “high-knowledge” positions: usable, but only if you can solve the equal-access problems with explicit internal rules (separation, inside-knee position, hand-fight priorities, and dilemma stacking).
- Require credible finishing mechanics on both inside and outside heel hooks so the opponent cannot steer you into the side where you are weakest.

### 5.2 Phased model (what must happen, in order)

- Phase 1 — Acquire a controlled leg position (entanglement as the control platform)
  - Establish ashi/entanglement structure with the knee line secured and hips controlled enough that the opponent cannot easily clear/extract.
- Phase 2 — Create exposure from control (heel/foot/knee exposure is built, not grabbed)
  - Use hip control + leg position + angle to force the heel/foot into an exposed state that you can keep through movement.
- Phase 3 — Apply breaking mechanics to the exposed structure
  - Separate “having exposure” from “being aligned to break”; finish only when alignment + control + opponent rotation are governed.
- Phase 4 — Continuity when defense triggers movement
  - When the opponent rolls, slips the heel, or clears the primary leg line, the system response is follow/reattach/transfer rather than reset.

### 5.3 Positional taxonomy (the hub set the system rotates through)

- Irimi Ashi Garami hub (primary entry/control + Achilles-first threat platform)
  - Used to build stable control, then force predictable reactions with the Achilles ↔ heel hook dilemma.
  - Includes explicit solutions for common structural problems (extraction attempts, forward pressure into the entanglement, heel slip).
- Outside Ashi hub (heel exposure platform with explicit back-exposure constraints)
  - Used when the angle/structure favors heel exposure but requires strict control rules to prevent the opponent turning away and generating back exposure.
  - Uses hip-control methods (e.g., scissoring and cross-shin style hip control) to keep exposure stable as the opponent changes posture (builds to knee, rotates, rolls).
- Cross Ashi / Shoelace hub (pummeling + passing-a-leg upgrades to improve exposure)
  - Cross-ashi is treated as a position with known issues that must be solved via leg pummeling and positional upgrades before forcing breaks.
  - Shoelace and “passing the leg” families (lace/dracula families) are used to change the opponent’s defensive options and expose one or both heels.
- Toe Hold / Top Ushiro hub (alternate break family + transition engine)
  - Toe holds are treated as a full subsystem with belly-up and belly-down exposure/finish mechanics.
  - Toe-hold threats are used to force transitions into heel-hook opportunities; top ushiro functions as an exposure platform that connects toe hold and heel hook threats and solves “locked-leg” stall states.
- 50/50 hub (symmetry endgame with explicit internal rules)
  - Requires internal gates (inside-knee positioning, separation strategy, and hand-fighting solutions) to make attacks safe and repeatable.
  - Uses dilemma pairs to prevent the opponent from choosing “stall/separate” as a safe outcome (toe hold ↔ separation; toe hold ↔ heel hook).
- Mutual Ashi hub (mutual entanglement priority rules)
  - Treated as a distinct problem class where sequencing/priority determines who wins exchanges; “going last” is used as an organizing rule for how to move out of mutuality into advantage.

### 5.4 Primary control gates (what decides whether you’re allowed to attack)

- Inside-position gate (feet/knees lane control)
  - Winning inside position (feet and knees inside the opponent’s feet and knees) is treated as the prerequisite for safe offense because it simultaneously grants access and denies their access.
  - If inside position is not won, the task is pummeling and re-organization rather than forcing breaks from a losing lane.
- Knee-line governance
  - Control of how deep the opponent’s knee can escape (and how much of the leg they can withdraw) is treated as a prerequisite for both exposure and finishing; if the knee line clears too early, offense collapses into resets.
- Hip-control governance
  - Hip control is treated as the stabilizer that makes exposure repeatable; if the opponent’s hips are free to rotate/turn away, exposures become transient and back-exposure risk rises (especially in outside-ashi).

### 5.5 Attack engines (how the system forces openings instead of “hoping”)

- Achilles ↔ heel hook dilemma (recurring primary engine)
  - Use Achilles threats to force predictable defenses that expose heel-hook lines; use heel-hook threats to force defensive alignments that reopen Achilles bites.
- Toe hold dilemmas (secondary engines that prevent stalling/separation)
  - Toe hold ↔ heel hook: toe-hold threat changes alignment/rotation in a way that opens heel exposure.
  - Toe hold ↔ separation (notably in 50/50): toe-hold threat forces reactions that prevent “clean separation” as a safe default.
- Two-leg constraint (double trouble)
  - Used when the opponent locks legs or freezes the entanglement to deny exposure; controlling/threatening both legs is used to force reactions that reopen a breakable line.

### 5.6 Defensive model (what the opponent will try, and the system’s default responses)

- Extraction / clearing the leg
  - System response: keep attachment and re-establish inside position lanes; upgrade/transfer to a hub that restores control rather than chasing the foot with no structure.
- Forward pressure into the entanglement
  - System response: structural frames and positional adjustments (including elbow/ashi positioning and post-ashi style structures) and directional finishes (e.g., belly-down Achilles line) when pressure forces that finishing vector.
- Defensive rolling
  - System response: treat rolling as expected; use roll theory + follow mechanics so the roll resolves into maintained attachment rather than reset.
- Heel slip
  - System response: treat heel slip as recurring; use explicit recovery families (high-hands style recovery and roll-through style recovery) to re-secure the heel and restore breaking alignment.
- “Locked legs” / stalemate
  - System response: apply multi-leg constraints (double trouble) and/or dilemma escalation (toe hold/knee bar pairing where applicable) to force openings.

### 5.7 Continuity rules (how the system stays connected through movement)

- Follow-the-leg rule
  - When the opponent rotates/rolls, maintain attachment to the moving leg rather than re-gripping late after the leg has cleared.
- Switching-legs rule
  - If the primary target leg clears, transfer to the other leg (or transfer entanglement family) to keep offense alive rather than restarting from zero.
- “Single-roll” framing (roll resolution constraint)
  - Rolling is treated as a solvable constraint problem: the system aims to structure the position so the opponent cannot roll indefinitely without giving you a re-entanglement or exposure outcome.

### 5.8 Training validation (how the system encodes reliability)

- Drills are used to encode the base positioning, attachment, and finishing alignment (including specific Achilles-focused drill blocks and foundational position drilling).
- Stress tests are used as resistance checks to confirm the control layer is real before investing in breaking mechanics (position survives extraction attempts, heel slip attempts, and rolling attempts).


## 6.0 TECHNIQUE LIBRARY

### 6.1 Volume 1 — Foundations (positions, gates, continuity tools, drills, submission concept families)

#### 6.1.1 Strategic position map (entanglement progression and what each is “for”)

- Primary hub sequence (as a learning spine): irimi ashi → outside ashi → cross ashi → inside ashi → 50/50 → mutual ashi
  - The value is not “knowing names,” but understanding how each position changes:
    - who has inside position,
    - what the opponent’s best escape direction is,
    - whether heel exposure is easy/hard,
    - how much back-exposure risk exists during exposure/finishing.
- Irimi ashi (strategy frame)
  - Built to protect from counter-offense while you build offense (less back-exposure risk).
  - Breaking mechanics can be very strong once heel exposure exists.
  - Trade-off: heel exposure is harder; opponent can more easily bring pressure forward and more easily heel-slip if exposure is not correct.
- Outside ashi (strategy frame)
  - Built to make outside heel exposure easier.
  - Trade-off: greater requirement to deny back exposure during exposure/finishing.
- Cross ashi (strategy frame)
  - Provides routes to control both of the opponent’s legs and to apply multi-attack trees (Achilles variations, leg laces, etc.).
  - Used as an upgrade when a single-leg entanglement becomes “hard to get a grip on” due to opponent defensive quality.

#### 6.1.2 Non-negotiable finishing requirement: inside + outside heel hooks

- Skill requirement: finish both inside and outside heel hooks.
  - Inside heel hooks are treated as mechanically stronger, but “only inside” is incomplete.
  - If one side is missing, the opponent can steer the exchange into the side you cannot finish.
- Practical implication: exposure + breaking mechanics must exist for both sides, not just “I can get to the position.”

#### 6.1.3 Inside-position battle (primary gate for winning leg-lock exchanges)

- Definition (explicit): keep your feet and knees inside the opponent’s feet and knees.
  - If your feet/knees are inside, you gain access to the opponent’s legs and deny their access to yours.
  - Mixed inside position (each has one foot inside) reduces certainty; the stronger inside-position player dominates exchanges.
- Decision rule:
  - If inside position is lost, do not commit to breaking mechanics; re-win inside position via pummeling/adjustment first.

#### 6.1.4 General escape directions (opponent’s default defensive vectors)

- Expected defensive objectives:
  - Clear the knee line and pull the leg out (extraction).
  - Rotate/roll to change alignment and remove exposure.
  - Drive forward pressure (especially relevant when exposure is weak) to crush the entanglement and/or enable heel slip.
- System response principle:
  - Treat escapes as predictable; build control + continuity to stop them, not “react late” after the leg is already cleared.

#### 6.1.5 Double trouble (two-leg constraint concept)

- Purpose: solve stalemates where single-leg exposure is repeatedly denied.
- Use-case trigger: opponent “locks” defensively and you cannot reliably secure heel exposure on the primary leg.
- Operational idea:
  - Increase constraint by controlling both legs so the opponent cannot freeze a single defensive leg configuration without opening another line.

#### 6.1.6 Continuity tools: following a leg + switching legs

- Following a leg
  - Objective: maintain attachment to the moving target leg through defensive rotation/roll/extraction attempts.
  - Key constraint: do not allow separation between bodies during opponent movement (attachment persists while they try to pull away).
- Switching legs
  - Trigger: primary target leg line becomes difficult to hold (clear/extraction/angle loss).
  - Objective: transfer to the other leg while preserving overall control advantage rather than resetting to neutral.

#### 6.1.7 Foundational drill blocks (what the drills are encoding)

- Basic drills
  - Encode: entanglement entry structure, inside-position awareness, knee-line attachment, and maintaining connection through movement.
- Achilles lock drill
  - Encode: stable straight-foot exposure, bite alignment, and ability to maintain connection while partner resists by pulling away.
- Cowboy drill
  - Encode: maintaining correct leg/hip relationship under resistance so heel slip becomes difficult and finishing alignment stays available.

#### 6.1.8 Submission concept families (what must be true for the break to work)

- Achilles lock concepts
  - Must be applied from a connected structure where the opponent cannot simply pull away and create space.
  - Control + connection are treated as prerequisites to meaningful breaking pressure.
- Knee bar concepts
  - Requires isolating the knee/hip relationship so extension cannot be removed by rotation.
- Toe hold concepts
  - Requires controlling the leg relationship so the opponent cannot freely spin out and remove foot alignment.
- Heel hook concepts
  - Requires reliable heel exposure plus anti-heel-slip structure; breaking mechanics depend on alignment + rotational control.


### 6.2 Volume 2 — Irimi Ashi Garami (structure, stress tests, Achilles engine, heel-slip counters, roll governance, transitions)

#### 6.2.1 Setting irimi ashi (structure before any breaking attempt)

- Objective: build an irimi ashi structure where:
  - the opponent cannot pull themselves away to create separation,
  - the knee line cannot easily clear,
  - your body and their body move as a connected unit during resistance (no “daylight”/gap).
- Connection requirement (explicitly tested later):
  - When the opponent pulls back, you move with them so there is no disconnection.
  - The opponent should “drag you as if you’re one person,” rather than creating separation and extracting.

#### 6.2.2 Stress test (control validation checkpoint)

- Purpose: verify that the ashi structure is tight enough to survive real defense before investing in finishing mechanics.
- Pass/fail cues:
  - Fail: opponent pulls away and you disconnect; knee line clears; you end up chasing late.
  - Pass: opponent pulls and you stay connected; there is no separation between bodies; extraction becomes difficult.

#### 6.2.3 Basic Achilles lock (baseline attack + forcing threat)

- Use as:
  - a legitimate finish when structure is correct,
  - a forcing threat that drives predictable defensive reactions into heel-hook opportunities.
- Key alignment constraint (practical):
  - If the lock is applied while the opponent can pull away and create space, the opponent will eventually pull the foot free.

#### 6.2.4 Countering basic extraction (anti-withdrawal retention)

- Trigger: opponent attempts to straighten/withdraw the leg past your knee line.
- Response goals:
  - stay attached during the withdrawal attempt,
  - close space (remove separation),
  - re-secure the structure before re-applying breaking pressure.

#### 6.2.5 Countering forward pressure with elbow position (anti-crush + anti-heel-slip layer)

- Problem set: opponent comes forward to crush posture and/or initiate heel slip while you are committed to the lock.
- Structural response (explicit cues):
  - Take the elbow in (toward ribs) rather than letting it flare or collapse.
  - Keep hands as high as possible.
  - Keep chin as low as possible.
  - As pressure drives the exchange, start to look belly down rather than remaining flat (directional posture management).
- Failure signal:
  - If hands drop and chin rises, bridging and maintaining breaking alignment become mechanically difficult.

#### 6.2.6 Countering forward pressure with post ashi (wedge creation + stronger break option)

- Trigger: opponent’s forward pressure makes the standard Achilles configuration imperfect/unstable.
- Structural build (explicit mechanics cues):
  - Bring one foot inside and place it on the opponent’s hip.
  - Use the second foot to push down (toward the floor) while raising hips to create a physical wedge.
  - Goal: make it “not easy” for the opponent to drive forward because the wedge blocks the crush.
- Outcome:
  - Post ashi provides a stronger breaking platform once wedge is established.

#### 6.2.7 Countering forward pressure with belly-down Achilles (directional finish choice)

- When pressure/rotation drives the exchange belly down, the finishing direction is treated as acceptable/expected.
- Constraint: structure must remain tight enough that the opponent cannot straighten and pull out past your knee line during the turn.

#### 6.2.8 Switching to butterfly ashi (hub transfer when geometry demands)

- Use-case: opponent’s posture/angle makes standard irimi continuation suboptimal.
- Objective: preserve attachment while changing entanglement geometry so exposure and control return.

#### 6.2.9 Achilles ↔ heel hook dilemma (forcing pair)

- Conceptual engine:
  - Achilles threat forces a defensive movement that exposes the heel.
  - Heel-hook threat forces defense that reopens Achilles pressure.
- Decision rule:
  - When the opponent’s defense meaningfully closes one line, immediately take the paired line (do not persist with the closed line).

#### 6.2.10 Heel slip counter: “high hands” recovery (anti-slip structure)

- Trigger: heel starts slipping as opponent comes forward.
- Key cues (explicit checklist used for maintaining the break under slip pressure):
  - Back heel engagement.
  - Knees pinched together.
  - Opponent’s toes drawn toward their butt.
  - Opponent’s heel aligned toward your chin.
  - Bridge and look over the bottom shoulder.
- Stress-test implication:
  - After establishing high hands + correct ashi, the opponent moving should not create separation; you should remain tight enough to proceed into mechanics.

#### 6.2.11 Heel slip counter: roll-through recovery (“reboot the system”)

- Trigger: opponent comes forward, manages to heel slip, and you do not want to be crushed.
- Response concept: roll through and re-establish a stable entanglement rather than fighting from a collapsing position.
- Explicit mechanics cues included in the roll-through response:
  - Point toes to the ground (foot to floor).
  - Use the roll to transition into a more stable entanglement (including a cross-ashi outcome) or roll the opponent through into a position where you can re-select the finishing route.

#### 6.2.12 Switching to outside ashi (transition to stronger exposure/breaking mechanics)

- Trigger: during transitions, the leg can “sneak out” in a way that favors outside-ashi breaking mechanics.
- Principle:
  - Choose the entanglement that makes your breaking mechanics strongest for the current geometry rather than staying committed to the initial hub.

#### 6.2.13 Single roll theory (roll governance model)

- Purpose: determine how many times and how fast the opponent can roll, and structure the position so the roll resolves into your advantage.
- Core constraint:
  - The directionality of force and your connection determine whether rolling becomes an escape or becomes a controlled transition.
- Explicit structural cues:
  - Create a strong connection of your leg to their leg (remove “daylight”/space).
  - Point knee toward the floor during the roll response (directional control cue).
  - Re-run the stress test logic: if connection is correct, the opponent should not be able to pull free during/after the roll.

#### 6.2.14 Figure-four switch when the opponent refuses to roll (forced reconfiguration)

- Trigger: opponent turns back into you, peels the foot, defends patiently, and does not give the expected roll.
- Execution constraints (explicit):
  - Do not perform the switch slowly; push immediately and pull your knee in.
  - Do not flare the knee in a way that allows full leg extraction.
  - Establish the figure-four configuration.
  - Flare knees and bring hips up; point toes as part of the finishing alignment.
- Additional distinction encoded:
  - Belly-up vs belly-down breaking mechanics differ; the position switch can change which mechanics set applies.

#### 6.2.15 Breaking mechanics (finish layer after exposure/control)

- Principle: breaking mechanics are a distinct layer after structure + exposure are correct.
- Included distinctions:
  - Breaking mechanics differ belly up vs belly down.
  - Slippage becomes more likely (e.g., when sweaty), so anti-slip structure and correct alignment are treated as mandatory.

---

### 6.3 Volume 3 — Outside Ashi (hip control, exposure variants, anti-back-exposure constraint)

#### 6.3.1 Irimi ashi vs outside ashi (selection rule)

- Outside ashi is selected when:
  - outside heel exposure pathways are more available than in irimi,
  - and you can maintain the additional safety constraints required to deny back exposure.

#### 6.3.2 Control while denying back exposure (non-negotiable constraint)

- The outside-ashi game is defined by two simultaneous requirements:
  - expose the heel,
  - deny the opponent’s turn-away lane that creates back exposure.
- Practical evaluation rule:
  - Any exposure pathway that opens an easy turn-away/back-take route is treated as structurally incorrect/incomplete.

#### 6.3.3 Hip control methods (tools used to stabilize exposure)

- Hip control by leg scissoring
  - Used to govern the opponent’s hip line when posture changes and the opponent tries to rotate out.
- Hip control with a cross-shin
  - Used to pin/steer the hips to keep heel exposure stable through opponent movement.

#### 6.3.4 Heel exposure pathways (distinct formats)

- Belly-down heel exposure
- Post-ashi heel exposure
- Post-feet heel exposure
- Cross-shin heel exposure
- Exposure on a kneeling opponent
- Operational implication:
  - Different exposure formats exist because opponent posture/pressure/rotation changes what alignment is available and what must be controlled.

#### 6.3.5 Heel-slip counter with a roll (outside-ashi specific slip response)

- Trigger: heel slip occurs and the opponent uses rotation/roll to remove exposure.
- Response: use a roll-based counter to preserve attachment and re-establish heel exposure rather than losing the leg line.

#### 6.3.6 Finishing Achilles vs defensive roll; heel knee bar add-on

- Defensive roll is treated as expected; finishing lines must account for it rather than being surprised by it.
- Heel knee bar is included as an additional finishing family integrated into outside-ashi endgames.

Section 6 continues with Volumes 4–6 (toe holds/top ushiro; cross-ashi/shoelace; 50/50 + mutual ashi) in the next part.

PATH: INS/gr-satl/bio-gr-satl.md

## 6.0 TECHNIQUE LIBRARY (continued)

### 6.4 Volume 4 — Toe Holds and Top Ushiro (exposure, finishing mechanics, transitions, dilemmas)

#### 6.4.1 Toe hold exposure: belly-down vs belly-up (two exposure orientations)

- Belly-down exposure (orientation choice)
  - Use when opponent posture/rotation makes the belly-down finish vector natural.
  - Exposure requirement: foot alignment must be controlled enough that the opponent cannot simply spin the leg to remove the toe line.
- Belly-up exposure (orientation choice)
  - Use when the leg relationship allows controlled rotation without turning belly-down.
  - Exposure requirement: maintain knee/hip relationship so the opponent cannot retract/clear while you chase the foot.

#### 6.4.2 Toe hold finishing mechanics: belly-down vs belly-up (breaking layer)

- Belly-down finishing mechanics
  - Apply rotational break only after exposure is stabilized (foot alignment + leg relationship).
  - Treat opponent’s ability to spin as the primary counter; finishing must deny free spinning.
- Belly-up finishing mechanics
  - Finish requires controlling the leg relationship so rotation is “taken” through the foot while the knee/hip line is governed.
  - Failure pattern: chasing the foot while the knee line clears or while the opponent rotates freely.

#### 6.4.3 Toe hold → heel hook transition (forcing pair conversion)

- Purpose: toe hold threat is used to force defensive movement that exposes the heel line.
- Transition rule:
  - When toe-hold defense creates heel exposure, convert immediately rather than persisting in a now-neutralized toe hold.
- Use-case: toe hold is not only a finish; it is a control-and-threat tool that changes the opponent’s alignment and defensive priorities.

#### 6.4.4 Recapturing a knee (knee-line re-control during toe-hold sequences)

- Trigger: opponent retracts/clears knee line as you attempt toe-hold exposure or during toe-hold → heel-hook transitions.
- Objective: regain knee-line governance so exposure is not transient.
- Functional meaning: toe hold without knee-line control becomes a foot chase; recapture restores structure.

#### 6.4.5 Calf slice switch (alternate damage/constraint line)

- Trigger: opponent uses defensive alignment/leg locking to deny toe-hold and/or heel-hook lines.
- Purpose:
  - Change defensive priorities by introducing a different break line.
  - Force reactions that reopen toe/heel exposure.
- Constraint: calf slice is treated as a “switch” line—used to redirect defense, not a random add-on.

#### 6.4.6 Top ushiro: introduction + entry (positional frame for combined exposure)

- Top ushiro is introduced as a positional hub that supports:
  - heel-hook exposure,
  - toe-hold exposure,
  - combined threat presentation (the opponent must defend multiple lines).
- Moving to top ushiro
  - Objective: establish a top-control frame over the opponent’s legs where their leg-locking defenses can be dismantled and exposure can be rebuilt.
  - Use-case: when legs are locked or exposure is difficult in lower entanglements, top ushiro functions as an escalation hub.

#### 6.4.7 Exposure from top ushiro (heel hook and toe hold exposure)

- Heel hook and toe hold exposure are presented as co-existing options from the hub.
- Decision rule:
  - If the opponent commits to defending one line (toe or heel), take the other line rather than persisting and stalling.
- Constraint: exposure must be stabilized (foot/heel presented and controlled) before breaking mechanics; top ushiro is a platform for that stabilization.

#### 6.4.8 Double trouble to counter locked legs (stuck-state solver within this volume)

- Trigger: opponent locks legs to deny exposure and freeze the position.
- Use of double trouble here:
  - Control/threaten both legs so the opponent cannot remain locked without opening another line.
  - The goal is not “hold double trouble forever,” but force a reaction that yields a clean exposure line.

#### 6.4.9 Toe hold ↔ knee bar dilemma (forcing pair to reopen finish lanes)

- Purpose: add a second forcing pair when toe-hold-only attacks stall.
- Logic:
  - Defensive alignment that protects toe hold exposes knee bar, and vice versa.
  - Use the opponent’s defense to choose the line rather than selecting blindly.
- Outcome: dilemma prevents the opponent from using a single “lock and wait” defense.

#### 6.4.10 Spinning the leg (mechanical tool for alignment creation)

- Purpose: use controlled leg rotation to:
  - improve exposure quality,
  - create/maintain breaking alignment,
  - prevent the opponent from re-squaring to neutral.
- Constraint: spinning is not “free movement”; it is applied while maintaining knee/hip relationship so the opponent cannot extract.

### 6.5 Volume 5 — Cross Ashi / Shoelace (positions, pummeling, lace/dracula families, dual-heel exposure, continuity)

#### 6.5.1 Cross ashi: leg positions (structure definition)

- Leg positions are treated as the foundation of cross ashi:
  - correct placement determines whether you can attack safely or whether the opponent can rotate/clear.
- Immediate implication:
  - if leg position is wrong, cross ashi creates “issues” (predictable failures) that must be solved before finishing attempts.

#### 6.5.2 Main issues associated with cross ashi (problem set you must solve)

- Cross ashi is framed as having repeatable defensive problems that appear if structure is not upgraded.
- The system response is not “attack harder”; it is:
  - pummel,
  - pass a leg,
  - change leg position so the issue disappears.

#### 6.5.3 Basic theory (what cross ashi is meant to enable)

- Cross ashi is intended to:
  - generate strong control of the opponent’s legs,
  - create access to Achilles threats and heel-hook exposures,
  - provide a platform to move into more constraining variants (lace/dracula families).

#### 6.5.4 Basic leg pummeling (positional improvement engine)

- Pummeling goal:
  - reclaim inside position lanes and upgrade cross-ashi structure.
- Decision rule:
  - if exposure is not available, pummel before forcing.
- Pummeling is treated as an active, repeatable solution to cross ashi issues, not an optional detail.

#### 6.5.5 Figure-4 Achilles (Achilles threat in cross-ashi structure)

- Use as:
  - a stable Achilles threat,
  - a forcing tool to open heel exposure.
- Constraint:
  - success requires cross-ashi structure to prevent easy pull-out/extraction.

#### 6.5.6 Reverse figure-4 Achilles (variant for different alignment/defense)

- Use to adjust pressure/alignment when opponent defense changes.
- Function:
  - keep Achilles threat credible across defensive postures so the Achilles ↔ heel hook engine remains available.

#### 6.5.7 Achilles → heel hook (upgrade line)

- Trigger: opponent defends Achilles in a way that exposes the heel line.
- Rule:
  - convert to heel hook when exposure is created; do not persist with a now-neutralized Achilles.

#### 6.5.8 Leg lace (passing-a-leg upgrade)

- Purpose: pass/lock the opponent’s leg to reduce their defensive rotation and improve exposure reliability.
- Value: lace changes the opponent’s ability to square up or clear knee line, creating a more stable finishing landscape.

#### 6.5.9 Leg lace → heel hook (exposure conversion)

- Lace is used as the control layer; heel hook becomes the breaking layer once exposure is created.
- Constraint:
  - exposure must be stabilized; lace is treated as the tool that stabilizes it.

#### 6.5.10 Passing a leg — 2-on-1 ankle (control upgrade)

- Purpose: isolate and control the ankle/leg to pass the leg across and improve your control geometry.
- Effect:
  - reduces opponent’s ability to rotate/clear, making exposure easier.

#### 6.5.11 Half dracula → heel hook (passing-a-leg variant to exposure)

- Half dracula is treated as a passing-a-leg family move used to:
  - change which heel is available,
  - reduce defensive rotation,
  - open heel exposure.
- Conversion rule:
  - once heel exposure is created, convert to heel hook rather than remaining in the passing step.

#### 6.5.12 Passing a leg — double dracula (stronger passing-a-leg constraint)

- Double dracula escalates the passing-a-leg constraint to further limit opponent movement.
- Purpose:
  - set up exposure of one or both heels with reduced risk of the opponent clearing their legs free.

#### 6.5.13 Exposing both heels (dual-heel escalation)

- Purpose: create a constraint state where the opponent cannot commit to defending only one heel.
- Use-case trigger:
  - single-heel exposure keeps being denied (opponent leg-locking, hiding heel, or rotating).
- Practical effect:
  - forces the opponent to open one side while defending the other, creating a more reliable finishing path.

#### 6.5.14 Countering primary leg escape with stretch ashi (escape-response structure)

- Trigger: opponent uses a primary leg escape pathway to clear a leg line.
- Response: shift to stretch-ashi structure to maintain attachment and prevent full extraction.

#### 6.5.15 Catching the heel without the secondary leg (heel-catch adaptation)

- Problem: secondary leg is not available or opponent defense prevents using it to trap.
- Solution concept:
  - still secure heel exposure by using alternate control mechanics rather than requiring the “ideal” secondary-leg trap.

#### 6.5.16 Catching the heel from shoelace ashi (shoelace-specific exposure)

- Shoelace ashi provides a configuration where heel exposure can be captured.
- Constraint:
  - secure the heel while controlling opponent rotation so the heel does not slip or hide during the catch.

#### 6.5.17 Heisting dilemma from shoelace ashi (forcing pair via movement threat)

- Use-case: opponent defends static exposure lines by stalling or re-squaring.
- Purpose:
  - introduce a heisting threat that forces the opponent to react, opening heel/foot exposure.
- Dilemma logic:
  - defense to the heist opens the exposure line; defense to exposure opens the heist-related continuation.

#### 6.5.18 Using an Achilles to mitigate back exposure (risk-control tool)

- Purpose: apply Achilles threat/structure as a method to reduce back-exposure risk during certain entanglement transitions.
- Logic:
  - Achilles threat changes opponent posture/rotation and can keep them “facing” rather than turning away.

#### 6.5.19 Countering a forced double inversion (anti-escape sequence)

- Trigger: opponent forces a double inversion as an escape/rotation method.
- Objective: prevent the inversion from becoming a clean exit by maintaining attachment and converting to a control structure that survives the rotation.

#### 6.5.20 Achilles grip → backside 50/50 (cross-volume transition hub)

- Transition used to move from Achilles-controlled structure into a backside 50/50 configuration.
- Purpose:
  - use backside 50/50 transitions as a continuation path when cross-ashi lines convert into 50/50 geometry.

#### 6.5.21 “When all fails, center chest” (emergency stabilisation cue)

- Use as an “anti-chaos” principle when the position becomes unstable.
- Functional meaning:
  - re-center your torso/chest relative to the opponent’s hips/leg line to regain connection and prevent the opponent from creating separation and extracting.

#### 6.5.22 Forward shift → heel hook (angle upgrade to exposure)

- Purpose: shift forward to improve heel exposure and enable heel-hook conversion.
- Trigger:
  - opponent defense makes heel exposure partial; forward shift changes alignment to complete exposure.

#### 6.5.23 Far-hip ashi to stop a roll (anti-roll control tool)

- Use-case: opponent initiates a roll to escape.
- Objective: control the far hip line with ashi structure so the roll cannot create separation and clear the leg line.

#### 6.5.24 Transfer to inside ashi (hub transfer to preserve advantage)

- Trigger: cross-ashi geometry becomes less optimal; inside ashi provides stronger control/exposure.
- Objective: transfer while maintaining connection so the opponent cannot extract during the transition.

#### 6.5.25 Following a roll (continuity rule applied to cross-ashi family)

- Maintain attachment through opponent rolling rather than letting the roll become an escape.
- “Follow” is treated as a core continuity rule: re-orient your body/ashi to stay on the target leg line.


### 6.6 Volume 6 — 50/50 and Mutual Ashi (internal gates, dilemma engines, hand-fight solutions, transitions, priority rules)

#### 6.6.1 Intro to 50/50 (hub framing: symmetric entanglement with explicit internal rules)

- 50/50 is treated as a distinct hub with:
  - equal-access danger (both can attack),
  - heavy reliance on internal gates (inside-knee position; separation control),
  - heavy reliance on grip/hand-fight outcomes to determine whether attacks are safe.
- Selection rule (implicit across the system):
  - 50/50 is not “default neutral”; it is entered with a plan (separate, expose, or transition), not to stall.

#### 6.6.2 “Attack until you’re defending” (priority principle)

- Priority framing:
  - In 50/50, the moment you stop solving defensive threats, you become the defender.
  - The hub punishes passive holding; it requires active sequencing to stay ahead of the opponent’s threats.
- Practical implication:
  - Attacks must be chosen to also manage the opponent’s counter-attacks (hand-fight, exposure, separation).

#### 6.6.3 Inside knee position (structural gate for safety and effectiveness)

- Inside-knee position is treated as a key structural requirement within 50/50.
- Functional role:
  - influences how safe your leg is from counters,
  - influences your ability to create separation and exposure.
- Decision rule:
  - if inside-knee positioning is not established, the task is to fix the knee/leg relationship before committing to breaking attempts.

#### 6.6.4 Separating a semi-sankaku (specific internal “stuck” problem)

- Semi-sankaku is treated as a specific entanglement constraint inside 50/50 that limits options.
- Objective:
  - create separation so the toe/heel dilemma engines become available.
- Practical meaning:
  - separation is not cosmetic; it is what turns 50/50 from a stalemate into an attackable structure.

#### 6.6.5 Toe hold ↔ separation dilemma (forcing pair to prevent “safe separation”)

- Threat logic:
  - Toe-hold threat forces reactions that disrupt clean separation or create exposure.
  - Separation attempt forces alignment changes that can expose the toe-hold line.
- Use-case:
  - When opponent attempts to separate as a “safe reset,” the system treats toe-hold threat as the counter that prevents separation being free.

#### 6.6.6 Toe hold ↔ heel hook dilemma (forcing pair inside the 50/50 hub)

- Toe hold threat changes foot alignment and opponent rotation; those defensive changes can expose heel-hook opportunities.
- Heel-hook defense changes alignment in ways that can reopen toe-hold control.
- Decision rule:
  - When defense commits to one line, take the other immediately; do not persist into a stabilized defense.

#### 6.6.7 Countering the hand fight (primary constraint problem in 50/50)

- Hand-fighting is treated as decisive:
  - if you lose grips/hand position, your attacks are delayed and the opponent’s attacks become available.
- Objective:
  - implement grip strategies that protect your own leg while enabling your attacks.
- Practical implication:
  - in 50/50, “attack selection” is constrained by the current hand-fight state; you must solve grips to unlock the break line.

#### 6.6.8 Cross-waist 50/50 (structural variant)

- Cross-waist 50/50 is presented as a specific configuration variant.
- Purpose:
  - change body alignment/connection to improve control, exposure, or safety.
- Use-case:
  - applied when standard 50/50 alignment makes separation/exposure difficult.

#### 6.6.9 Sweep/inversion dilemma vs kneeling opponent (opponent posture-specific forcing)

- When opponent is kneeling, the hub is treated as creating a new dilemma:
  - sweep line vs inversion line (forcing the opponent to concede position or exposure).
- Practical meaning:
  - posture changes create different “best” dilemmas; the system adapts the forcing pair to the posture.

#### 6.6.10 Backside 50/50 transitions (continuity + hub upgrade)

- Backside 50/50 is treated as an upgrade/transition space where:
  - control and exposure lines can change,
  - follow mechanics are used to stay attached as the opponent turns/rolls.
- Purpose:
  - prevent opponent from using rolling to reset; transitions keep you in an advantaged entanglement.

#### 6.6.11 Following a roll (50/50 continuation rule)

- Rolling is treated as expected; 50/50 must include follow mechanics to maintain connection.
- Outcome objective:
  - roll does not end the exchange; it becomes a transition to a better angle/hub.

---

### 6.7 Mutual Ashi (priority rules and exit mechanics)

#### 6.7.1 Intro to mutual ashi (mutual access as a distinct endgame problem)

- Mutual ashi is treated as a special-case hub where both players have access and where “first move” is not automatically advantage.
- The hub requires explicit priority rules to decide when to commit and how to avoid losing on the opponent’s reactive counter.

#### 6.7.2 Going last (priority / sequencing rule)

- “Going last” is treated as a core winning rule in mutual ashi:
  - the player who moves last can capitalize on the opponent’s commitment and end in superior control/exposure.
- Practical implication:
  - do not initiate blindly; induce or anticipate the opponent’s commitment, then use your move to end in advantage.

#### 6.7.3 Rolling through (exit method from mutuality)

- Roll-through is presented as a tool to:
  - escape the mutual stalemate,
  - convert mutual entanglement into a more favorable hub where you can finish.
- Constraint:
  - roll-through is not a disengagement; it is a controlled exit that maintains attachment to the leg line.

#### 6.7.4 Far-hip ashi (control tool within mutual / anti-escape constraint)

- Far-hip ashi is used to:
  - control opponent’s hip line,
  - limit their ability to rotate out or clear,
  - stop roll-based escapes during mutual exchanges.
- Functional meaning:
  - hip control remains the stabilizer even in mutuality; controlling the far hip limits the opponent’s “turn-away” options.

#### 6.7.5 Gripping (endgame detail layer)

- Gripping is treated as a determining factor in mutual ashi outcomes:
  - grip quality determines whether you can secure exposure or whether the opponent can strip and re-square.
- Decision rule:
  - do not commit to the exit/finish without grips that prevent immediate counter-escape.

#### 6.7.6 Outro (integration)

- Closing integration emphasizes:
  - mutual ashi is governed by priority sequencing and controlled exits,
  - follow mechanics and hub transfers are the system’s default way to maintain advantage rather than accepting resets.

+-----------------------------------+

- Entry selection triggers (choose the hub that makes your next 2–3 actions easiest, not the hub you “like”)
  - [IRIMI/INSIDE ASHI]: you can clamp tight connection early and build straight-lock pressure into the Achilles <-> heel-hook forcing pair.
  - [OUTSIDE ASHI]: heel exposure geometry is available, but you must keep back-exposure denial as a live constraint.
  - [CROSS/SHOELACE]: you need pummeling + passing-a-leg upgrades (lace/dracula) to defeat defensive leg locking and create better exposure.
  - [TOE HOLD/TOP USHIRO]: opponent’s leg locking, posture, or alignment makes toe-hold threats or top-ushiro escalation the best forcing route.
  - [50/50]: symmetry is unavoidable or chosen; the hub requires inside-knee gate + hand fight solutions + separation dilemmas.
  - [MUTUAL ASHI]: mutual access exists; priority sequencing (“going last”) governs whether you gain advantage or concede it.
- Inside-position gate (attack permission rule)
  - If inside lanes are not won, “attack attempts” become defensive races; the system response is pummeling and lane recovery.
  - Inside lanes are evaluated dynamically: if the opponent pummels inside during your offense, treat it as an alarm and repair first.
- Control layer (what must be governed before you treat exposure as real)
  - Knee line: opponent cannot freely withdraw past your clamp.
  - Hips: opponent cannot freely rotate to remove exposure or turn away for back exposure.
  - Heel slip: opponent cannot easily strip heel exposure once you have it.
  - Free spinning: opponent cannot spin the foot/leg to neutralize toe-hold and heel exposure lines.
- Threat engine (forcing pair rule)
  - If a threat is defended “well,” the correct action is usually to take the paired line rather than to push harder on the defended line.
- Outcome handling (no reset bias)
  - When defense triggers movement, the default is follow/roll-through/switch legs/transfer hubs rather than accepting a neutral reset.

- Dilemma construction rules (what makes it a dilemma, not two random attacks)
  - Both threats must be credible from the same control platform (or within one transition).
  - The opponent’s “best” defense to one line must predictably produce exposure or alignment for the other line.
- Common defensive triggers that flip the dilemma
  - Achilles pressure triggers: opponent turns/extends/rolls/tries to peel and run.
  - Heel-hook threat triggers: opponent hides heel, changes knee/hip orientation, or tries to clear the knee line.
- Failure patterns (why the dilemma “doesn’t work”)
  - Achilles is applied with poor connection; opponent simply withdraws without meaningful concession.
  - Heel exposure is “touched” but not secured; heel slips immediately and the opponent returns to lane control.
  - Attacker persists on the defended line instead of converting, allowing the defender to settle.
- Corrections (decision rules)
  - If defense reduces pressure but opens heel: convert to heel exposure immediately.
  - If heel is hidden or heel-hook grip is stripped: reassert Achilles bite as the follow threat instead of chasing heel late.

        |
        v
+-----------------------------------------------+
| SAFETY CHECK                                  |
| "Does this exposure open a clear turn-away    |
| lane that gives them a path to my back?"      |
+--------------------------+--------------------+
                           |
                     {OR} yes|no
                         v   v
      +--------------------------------+    +-----------------------------------+
      | CHANGE CONTROL METHOD / ANGLE  |    | PROCEED: exposure -> break layer   |
      | - re-govern hips               |    | - follow roll, deny turn-away      |
      | - change shin/leg control      |    | - keep attachment through movement |
      +--------------------------------+    +-----------------------------------+

- Safety check is continuous, not one-time
  - The risk appears most often during the moment you switch from control to exposure (the opponent turns away as you chase the heel).
- Primary constraint (outside-ashi identity)
  - If your exposure method gives the opponent a clean turn-away lane, treat it as a structural failure, not “bad luck.”
- Typical trigger moments that create back-exposure risk
  - You expose the heel while hips are not governed; opponent rotates away and you lose chest-to-hip relationship.
  - You commit hands to the heel while legs are not controlling rotation; opponent uses that window to turn.
- Correction hierarchy (what changes first)
  - Re-govern the hips (increase hip control) before recommitting to the heel.
  - Adjust your leg structure/shin positioning so the opponent’s rotation is denied.
  - Only then re-enter exposure/finishing mechanics.

                       v
[Re-secure heel + restore alignment] -> (continue break or convert to paired line)

- Heel slip definition (when to treat it as “happening”)
  - Heel is moving out of the control point such that finishing rotation will soon become impossible.
- “High hands” recovery (structure-first)
  - Objective: re-secure heel control by changing hand position higher and tightening the system so forward pressure cannot strip the heel.
  - Live constraints commonly paired with this recovery:
    - knee pinch maintained,
    - heel-to-chin type alignment maintained,
    - posture/bridge alignment maintained so the break line remains available.
- “Roll-through” recovery (movement-first)
  - Objective: use rotation to re-establish a stable entanglement (often a hub transfer) rather than fighting from a collapsing configuration.
  - Use-case triggers:
    - opponent’s forward pressure is crushing the structure,
    - heel slip is progressing and “fixing it in place” is failing.
- Failure patterns (why recoveries fail)
  - Recovery is attempted after full separation occurs (too late).
  - Recovery is attempted without restoring hip/knee-line control, so heel is re-caught briefly then slips again.
- Correction rule
  - The recovery is successful only if it restores a state where the heel cannot immediately slip again under the same defensive action.

     [Force reaction] -> [Return to one-heel exposure] -> (Finish)

- Cross-ashi identity rule
  - Cross ashi is treated as a position with known “issues”; the correct solution is upgrading structure via pummeling and passing-a-leg, not forcing breaks from unstable structure.
- Pummeling triggers (when pummeling is mandatory)
  - Inside lanes are compromised.
  - The opponent can rotate/clear freely.
  - You cannot generate stable exposure without losing attachment.
- Passing-a-leg families (why they exist in the system)
  - They change which heel is exposed and reduce the opponent’s ability to rotate out.
  - They turn “hard-to-catch heel” problems into “the heel must appear” problems by forcing the opponent’s leg relationship to change.
- Dual-heel exposure (why it is an escalation)
  - If the opponent can comfortably defend one heel, exposing both increases constraint and forces them to “choose” a defense that opens a finishing line.
- Failure patterns
  - Trying to finish while cross-ashi issues are unresolved (opponent extracts).
  - Over-committing to heel catch with no knee-line control (heel slip + reset).
- Corrections
  - Treat cross ashi as “upgrade-first”: pummel → pass-a-leg → exposure → finish.

{OR} (Finish) Toe Hold / Heel Hook
     (Transition) Backside 50/50
     (Reset) Re-enter hub with gates repaired

- 50/50 is treated as a “constraint hub,” not a free-attack hub
  - The hub imposes requirements (inside-knee position; grip control; separation work) that must be satisfied before high-confidence breaks.
- Inside-knee gate (why it is first)
  - Without the correct inside-knee relationship, your leg is more exposed to counters and your separation/exposure tools degrade.
- Hand-fight constraint (why it precedes finish attempts)
  - If you lose the hand fight, you lose the ability to secure exposure and you may concede counter-exposure.
- Separation dilemmas (what separation “does” in the system)
  - Separation is not just movement; it creates the geometry that makes toe-hold and heel-hook lines appear reliably.
- Failure patterns
  - Trying to “attack through” a lost hand fight.
  - Ignoring the inside-knee gate and getting countered or stalled.
  - Treating separation as optional and ending in stalemate.
- Corrections (sequencing rule)
  - Fix knee relationship → solve grips → create separation → run the dilemma pair.

     [Transfer to favorable hub] -> (Finish)

- Mutual ashi identity (why it is special)
  - Both players have access; speed alone is unreliable because initiating can expose you to reactive counters.
- “Going last” operational meaning
  - Do not commit first into mutual access unless you have a guaranteed control advantage.
  - Induce or detect their commitment, then use your action to end in superior structure/exposure.
- Roll-through exit (why it exists)
  - Mutuality is treated as a problem to be solved by controlled exit into a favorable hub rather than by trading blind finishes.
- Far-hip ashi control (why it matters in mutuality)
  - Hip control limits the opponent’s ability to rotate away and removes a common escape axis during the transition out of mutuality.
- Failure patterns
  - Initiating first without control advantage and getting countered.
  - Exiting without hip control and allowing the opponent to rotate free.
- Corrections
  - Treat mutual ashi as a priority/timing hub: win the sequence (“last mover”) and exit into a non-mutual finishing platform.


## 8.0 APPLICATION SCENARIOS

### 8.1 Inside-position scramble: both players hunting legs (who gets to attack first)

- Problem shape
  - Both players have partial access; inside lanes are contested (feet/knees pummeling).
  - Attacks initiated without inside position become mutual-attack races rather than controlled offense.
- Primary objective
  - Win inside position (feet + knees inside) before committing to exposure/finishing.
- Decision rules
  - If inside position is lost mid-attack, treat it as an emergency: repair lanes first, then re-apply threat engine.
  - If inside position is mixed (each has one inside lane), treat it as unstable: continue pummeling until you have a clear lane advantage.
- Success indicators
  - You can access their legs while their access to your legs is blocked/delayed by your inside lanes.
- Common failure patterns
  - Chasing a heel/foot while losing lane control, resulting in counter-entry or mutual exposure.
  - Treating “touching the leg” as control while knee line is not governed.

### 8.2 Opponent attempts a basic extraction (pulling the leg out / clearing knee line)

- Problem shape
  - Opponent withdraws the trapped leg; if separation appears, the leg clears.
- Primary objective
  - Maintain attachment (no separation), re-secure knee-line governance, then re-enter the threat engine.
- Immediate priorities
  - Follow the leg during the withdrawal attempt (do not reach late after the leg has cleared).
  - Re-establish the entanglement clamp before applying breaking pressure again.
- Decision rules
  - If your connection breaks (separation appears), treat the finishing attempt as over; rebuild control first.
  - If extraction attempts repeatedly succeed, treat it as a structural problem (failed stress test): rebuild the hub, then retest.
- Failure patterns
  - Continuing to pull on a lock while the opponent is already clearing the knee line.
  - “Foot chasing” after extraction begins instead of maintaining a connected entanglement.

### 8.3 Opponent drives forward pressure into the entanglement (crushing posture + heel-slip pressure)

- Problem shape
  - Forward pressure collapses posture, reduces finishing leverage, and increases the chance of heel slip.
- Primary objective
  - Preserve structure under pressure while keeping the break line available; choose the correct counter-family rather than fighting the crush directly.
- Response families (selection by what pressure is doing)
  - Elbow-position solution (structure-first)
    - Keep elbow position correct (no flaring/collapse) to preserve mechanical advantage under pressure.
    - Keep hands high and chin low to prevent posture collapse from killing the break.
    - If the exchange is driving belly-down, accept the directional finish vector rather than resisting into collapse.
  - Post-ashi wedge solution (wedge-first)
    - Place a foot to the hip and use the other foot to push down while raising hips to form a wedge.
    - Objective: make forward pressure mechanically “expensive” and preserve a stronger break platform.
  - Belly-down Achilles option (directional finish choice)
    - When posture/pressure forces the vector, finish belly down while maintaining knee-line control.
- Failure patterns
  - Letting posture collapse (hands drop; chin rises), then trying to “muscle” the finish.
  - Ignoring the wedge requirement and accepting continuous forward pressure until structure breaks.

### 8.4 Opponent uses defensive rolling as the main escape tool

- Problem shape
  - Opponent rolls to change alignment, strip heel exposure, or clear the knee line.
- Primary objective
  - Convert the roll into continuity: follow the leg, govern the roll outcome, and re-land in control/exposure.
- Core tools (how the system expects you to solve rolls)
  - Single-roll theory (roll governance)
    - Structure the position so the roll resolves predictably (not infinite escape).
    - Maintain tight connection; if connection is correct, rolling does not create separation.
  - Follow-the-leg rule (attachment through rotation)
    - Maintain attachment as the opponent rotates; do not allow the leg to “leave your body.”
  - Switch-legs rule (continuity if target clears)
    - If the primary target leg clears during the roll, transfer to the other leg or transfer hubs rather than resetting.
- Failure patterns
  - Letting the roll create separation, then trying to recover with late grips.
  - Persisting on a defended line through the roll rather than converting to the paired line when exposure changes.

### 8.5 Opponent defends by refusing to roll (stalling, peeling, “patient defense”)

- Problem shape
  - Opponent denies the expected rolling response and instead defends in place, attempting to peel and extract.
- Primary objective
  - Force a reconfiguration that reopens exposure rather than stalling on a defended line.
- System response
  - Execute the figure-four switch as the forced reconfiguration when the opponent refuses to roll.
  - Key constraints: the switch is decisive and structured (not slow), and the knee/hip relationship must not open an extraction window during the switch.
- Failure patterns
  - Switching too slowly and allowing full extraction.
  - Remaining committed to the original line when defense has stabilized.

### 8.6 Heel slip occurs during exposure/finishing (loss of heel control)

- Problem shape
  - Heel begins to slip from control, often paired with forward pressure or rotation.
- Primary objective
  - Recover heel control before it fully escapes; restore alignment so the same defense cannot immediately re-strip the heel.
- Response families
  - High-hands recovery (structure-first)
    - Re-secure heel by adjusting hand position and tightening structure so forward pressure cannot strip the heel.
    - Maintain knee pinch and alignment constraints that keep the heel “loaded” into the breaking line.
  - Roll-through recovery (movement-first)
    - Use a roll-through to rebuild a stable entanglement when forward pressure + heel slip are collapsing the structure.
    - Treat roll-through as a controlled transition to regain a finishing platform, not a disengagement.
- Failure patterns
  - Attempting recovery after full separation has already occurred (too late).
  - Re-catching the heel without restoring knee-line/hip control, resulting in immediate repeat slip.

### 8.7 Outside-ashi exposure attempt creates back-exposure risk (turn-away lane opens)

- Problem shape
  - As you chase heel exposure, the opponent gains a clear turn-away lane that can expose your back.
- Primary objective
  - Deny the turn-away lane first, then re-attempt exposure; never treat back exposure as an acceptable trade for heel exposure.
- Safety rule
  - Any exposure method that gives a clean turn-away lane is structurally incorrect/incomplete and must be changed.
- Practical corrections
  - Re-govern hips (increase hip control) before recommitting to heel exposure.
  - Adjust the control method (e.g., re-establish hip control format) so exposure is created without opening the back.
- Failure patterns
  - Prioritizing heel contact over hip governance.
  - Allowing the opponent to rotate freely during the exposure moment.

### 8.8 Opponent presents a “high leg” defensive problem (harder to enter or exposes different lines)

- Problem shape
  - High-leg positioning changes access routes and can deny the standard entry/exposure path.
- System responses (as framed in the series)
  - Use dedicated counters for the high-leg scenario rather than forcing standard entries.
  - Wrist-to-wrist toe-hold option appears as a named solution in this scenario class (use when alignment presents it).
- Failure patterns
  - Trying to force standard exposure when the leg height/angle denies it.
  - Ignoring the alternate line and burning time into a structurally blocked pathway.

### 8.9 Opponent drops to a kneeling posture (exposure geometry changes)

- Problem shape
  - Kneeling posture changes the exposure pathway and the direction of control required.
- Primary objective
  - Use kneeling-opponent-specific exposure to maintain advantage rather than losing the leg line as posture changes.
- Failure patterns
  - Treating the kneeling opponent like a standing/squared opponent and losing exposure timing.

### 8.10 “Locked legs” / stalemate defense (opponent freezes the position)

- Problem shape
  - Opponent locks legs and uses structure to deny exposure; the exchange stalls.
- Primary objective
  - Apply multi-leg constraint tools and dilemma escalation to force openings; do not wait out the stall.
- System tools
  - Double trouble (two-leg constraint)
    - Control both legs so the opponent cannot freeze one defensive configuration without opening another line.
  - Toe-hold dilemma escalation (toe hold ↔ knee bar) where applicable
    - Use a paired threat to prevent the opponent from defending with one static alignment.
- Failure patterns
  - Persisting in single-heel hunting while the opponent’s locked structure prevents exposure.
  - Treating stalemate as neutral time instead of an active “problem to solve.”

### 8.11 50/50: opponent tries to separate as the “safe exit” (separation dilemma activation)

- Problem shape
  - Opponent attempts to separate and reset from 50/50; symmetry often stalls if separation is unopposed.
- Primary objective
  - Run the toe-hold ↔ separation dilemma so separation is no longer a free defensive choice.
- Sequencing constraints (internal order)
  - Inside-knee position gate first.
  - Hand-fight constraint second (win grips/deny grips).
  - Separation work third (create usable geometry).
  - Then run dilemma pair(s) (toe hold ↔ separation; toe hold ↔ heel hook).
- Failure patterns
  - Attempting to attack without solving hand fight.
  - Attempting to “hold 50/50” without separation mechanics, resulting in stall.

### 8.12 Mutual ashi: both players have access (priority sequencing decides winner)

- Problem shape
  - Mutual access exists; committing first can expose you to reactive counters.
- Primary objective
  - Apply priority rule “going last” and exit mutuality into a favorable hub rather than trading blind finishes.
- System tools
  - Going last (timing rule)
    - Induce or detect opponent commitment, then respond to end in advantage.
  - Rolling through (exit method)
    - Use roll-through as a controlled exit to land in a favorable entanglement rather than staying in mutuality.
  - Far-hip ashi (anti-rotation control)
    - Govern hips during the exit so the opponent cannot rotate free mid-transition.
- Failure patterns
  - Initiating first without control advantage.
  - Exiting mutuality without hip governance, allowing the opponent to clear and reset.


## 9.0 DRILLING PROGRESSIONS

### 9.1 Foundational connection and “no separation” standard (baseline for all hubs)

- Baseline pass/fail (applies across irimi/outside/cross/50-50/mutual)
  - Pass: partner cannot create separation (“daylight”) between bodies while pulling/withdrawing/turning; your position moves with them as a connected unit.
  - Fail: partner pulls away and you stay behind; you end up reaching late for foot/heel with no structure; knee line clears.

- Progression (connection-first)
  - Step 1: Static entanglement establishment reps
    - Build the entanglement structure until the “no separation” feeling is consistent (do not chase finishes yet).
  - Step 2: Partner adds basic withdrawal (extraction attempts)
    - Your job: follow the leg and keep attachment; re-secure knee-line clamp before any breaking pressure.
  - Step 3: Add posture/pressure changes (forward pressure)
    - Your job: preserve structure under pressure and choose the correct counter-family (elbow-position structure, post-ashi wedge, belly-down line).
  - Step 4: Add rotational defense (rolling)
    - Your job: apply “follow the leg” and “single roll” governance rather than resetting.

### 9.2 Volume 1 drill blocks (base reps before stress testing)

- 9.2.1 “Basic drills” block (as a base layer)
  - Intent: encode entanglement structure + attachment + lane awareness before integrating finishes.
  - Technical checkpoints (what the drill must produce)
    - Inside-position awareness: you can feel when you have (or lose) inside lanes and respond by pummeling rather than forcing.
    - Knee-line attachment: partner cannot simply pull out once you clamp; if they can, treat as structure failure and rebuild.
    - Continuity habits: when partner moves, you follow; you do not pause and then re-grip late.

- 9.2.2 Achilles lock drill block (straight-lock threat as the first forcing tool)
  - Intent: build a credible straight-lock threat that forces meaningful defensive reactions (the base for the Achilles ↔ heel-hook dilemma).
  - Stress cues (what you check during reps)
    - Partner tries to pull away: you maintain attachment; no separation.
    - Partner tries to pressure forward: you preserve the lock structure (do not let posture collapse kill the break line).
  - Failure pattern and correction
    - Failure: partner repeatedly pulls foot out cleanly.
    - Correction: treat it as a connection problem (rebuild tightness) rather than a “finish harder” problem.

- 9.2.3 Cowboy drill block (movement/alignment control during finishing)
  - Intent: rehearse maintaining correct leg/hip relationship during the finishing moment so defenses (heel slip, pressure, rotation) do not instantly break alignment.
  - Use-case encoded by the drill
    - You can keep your finishing alignment while the partner moves/adjusts, rather than requiring a static partner to finish.

### 9.3 Stress test protocols (repeatable resistance checks embedded throughout)

- 9.3.1 Stress test (general)
  - Goal: validate that position is stable before you treat finishing mechanics as relevant.
  - What partner should try (the most common “truth tests”)
    - Pull away to create separation and clear the knee line.
    - Apply forward pressure to crush posture and drive heel slip.
    - Rotate/roll to strip exposure and reset.
  - Pass criteria
    - You remain “sticky” (attached) during each attempt; you can keep or immediately re-secure the entanglement.
  - Fail criteria
    - Any consistent extraction where you must chase late with hands while your legs/hips are no longer controlling the opponent.

- 9.3.2 Irimi-specific stress test emphasis (connection + pressure management)
  - Partner tasks
    - Withdraw the leg repeatedly (basic extraction).
    - Drive forward pressure repeatedly (simulate crush/heel-slip pressure).
  - Attacker tasks (structure-first)
    - Maintain high-quality attachment (no separation).
    - Select the appropriate pressure counter-family:
      - Elbow-position structure (hands high, chin low, elbow managed) when pressure threatens posture and alignment.
      - Post-ashi wedge when you need a stronger mechanical platform against forward drive.
      - Belly-down line when posture/rotation dictates that finish vector.

- 9.3.3 Outside-ashi stress test emphasis (hip control + back-exposure denial)
  - Partner tasks
    - Turn away during exposure moments to create back-exposure lanes.
    - Roll to strip heel exposure.
  - Attacker tasks
    - Treat “deny back exposure” as a live constraint; if exposure opens turn-away lanes, stop and rebuild hip governance.
    - Re-run exposure pathways only when safety constraint is satisfied.

### 9.4 Continuity drilling (roll governance, attachment through movement, leg switching)

- 9.4.1 Following a leg (attachment through motion)
  - Drill objective: partner moves (withdrawal/roll/turn) and you remain connected to the moving leg so you do not end in late chases.
  - Resistance ladder
    - Light movement → continuous movement → partner attempts to “leave the entanglement” with committed withdrawals/turns.
  - Pass/fail
    - Pass: your attachment survives; you stay on the leg line.
    - Fail: partner’s movement creates a gap; you lose the leg and must reach.

- 9.4.2 Switching legs (continuity when primary target clears)
  - Drill objective: when the primary target leg becomes non-viable, you transfer to the other leg (or transfer hub) without resetting to neutral.
  - Trigger conditioning
    - Partner intentionally clears the primary leg line mid-sequence; your job is immediate transfer rather than insistence.

- 9.4.3 Single-roll governance (roll outcome control)
  - Drill objective: partner rolls defensively; you structure attachment and angle so the roll resolves into maintained control rather than repeated resets.
  - Key constraint to encode
    - The roll must not create separation; if it does, treat as structural failure and rebuild attachment mechanics before increasing resistance.

### 9.5 Heel-slip recovery progressions (two named recovery families)

- 9.5.1 “High hands” recovery reps (structure-first heel-slip defense)
  - Drill objective: when heel slip begins, re-secure exposure and restore finishing alignment without allowing the same defense to immediately re-strip.
  - Technical checklist cues to encode during reps
    - Knees pinched.
    - Heel/line alignment oriented into your breaking mechanics.
    - Posture/bridge alignment preserved under pressure.
  - Resistance ladder
    - Partner lightly slips → partner aggressively drives forward while slipping → partner combines slip with rotation.

- 9.5.2 Roll-through recovery reps (movement-first heel-slip defense)
  - Drill objective: when forward pressure + heel slip collapses the position, roll-through to re-establish a stable entanglement rather than fighting from collapse.
  - Pass/fail
    - Pass: roll-through results in a re-established control platform (not a scramble reset).
    - Fail: roll-through becomes a disengagement and you lose the leg line.

### 9.6 “Locked legs / stalemate” breaking progressions (double trouble + dilemma escalation)

- 9.6.1 Double trouble reps (two-leg constraint)
  - Drill objective: partner locks defensively; you use two-leg control to force openings rather than waiting or repeatedly failing to expose one heel.
  - Success indicator
    - The opponent is forced to open a line (by reacting) and you regain a clean exposure path.
  - Failure pattern
    - You treat double trouble as static holding (no forced reaction) and the stalemate remains.

- 9.6.2 Toe hold ↔ knee bar dilemma reps (when used to defeat stalls)
  - Drill objective: partner defends one line with alignment; you take the paired line rather than persisting into a stabilized defense.
  - Pass criteria
    - Clear, immediate conversion on defense trigger (defense dictates the switch).

### 9.7 50/50 drilling progression (gates → separation → dilemmas)

- Gate sequence to drill in order (internal order constraint)
  - Step 1: Inside-knee position gate
    - Drill until you can consistently establish/repair inside-knee relationship before attacking.
  - Step 2: Hand-fight constraint
    - Drill grip exchanges until you can prevent losing grips that stall your attacks or concede counters.
  - Step 3: Separation work
    - Drill separation creation as the condition that makes dilemma pairs usable rather than theoretical.
  - Step 4: Dilemma pairs
    - Toe hold ↔ separation.
    - Toe hold ↔ heel hook.
  - Step 5: Backside 50/50 transitions + follow mechanics
    - Drill following movement so partner’s roll/turn becomes transition (not reset).

### 9.8 Mutual ashi drilling progression (priority rule → controlled exits)

- 9.8.1 “Going last” timing reps (priority sequencing)
  - Drill objective: do not initiate blindly; recognize/induce partner commitment and respond to end in advantage.
  - Pass/fail
    - Pass: your response is structurally advantaged (control/exposure improves).
    - Fail: you initiate first and concede reactive counter opportunities.

- 9.8.2 Rolling-through exit reps (leave mutuality into a favorable hub)
  - Drill objective: use roll-through as a controlled exit that maintains attachment and lands you in a favorable entanglement family.
  - Constraint
    - Exit must preserve hip governance (far-hip control concept) so partner cannot rotate free mid-transition.

## 10.0 FOUR-WEEK CURRICULUM

### 10.1 Week 1 — Foundations: lanes, connection, straight-lock threat, continuity habits

- Session objective
  - Build the base “no separation” standard, understand inside-position lanes, and establish a credible Achilles threat as the first forcing tool.
- Content spine
  - Inside-position battle (feet/knees inside): recognize, win, repair.
  - Connection standard: entanglement tightness such that partner cannot pull away and create separation.
  - Basic drills block (structure + lane awareness).
  - Achilles lock drill block (credible straight-lock threat).
  - Continuity basics: follow the leg; switch legs.
- Key constraints to enforce
  - No finishing attempts unless connection passes a light stress test (partner tries to pull out; you stay attached).
  - If inside lanes are lost, pummel first; do not “attack through” lane loss.
- Stress test focus (end-of-session validation)
  - Partner tries basic extraction repeatedly.
  - Pass criteria: you remain attached; no late chasing.

### 10.2 Week 2 — Irimi ashi engine: pressure management, heel-slip recovery, Achilles ↔ heel hook dilemma

- Session objective
  - Build a stable irimi ashi platform that survives pressure and integrates heel-slip recovery and the Achilles ↔ heel hook forcing pair.
- Content spine
  - Setting irimi ashi (structure-first).
  - Stress test checkpoints (extraction + forward pressure).
  - Countering forward pressure families:
    - elbow-position structure,
    - post-ashi wedge,
    - belly-down line when dictated.
  - Achilles ↔ heel hook dilemma sequencing (convert on defense trigger).
  - Heel slip recoveries:
    - “high hands” recovery,
    - roll-through recovery.
- Key constraints to enforce
  - Pressure problem is solved structurally first (posture, wedge, connection), not by pulling harder.
  - Heel slip is treated as expected; recovery is drilled as a required skill, not an “emergency only.”
- Stress test focus
  - Partner drives forward pressure while attempting heel slip.
  - Pass criteria: you maintain connection and can either recover heel or roll-through to a stable platform.

### 10.3 Week 3 — Outside/cross hubs: hip control, back-exposure denial, pummeling and passing-a-leg upgrades

- Session objective
  - Learn to expose heels safely in outside ashi (with back-exposure denial), and learn cross-ashi upgrades that defeat defensive leg locking and create stable exposures.
- Content spine
  - Outside ashi:
    - hip control methods (scissoring; cross-shin style control),
    - heel exposure pathways (belly-down, post-ashi, post-feet, cross-shin),
    - safety check: deny turn-away/back exposure during exposure moments.
    - heel-slip roll counter (outside-ashi slip response).
  - Cross ashi / shoelace:
    - identify cross-ashi issues (structure problems),
    - leg pummeling to re-win inside lanes,
    - passing-a-leg ladder:
      - leg lace,
      - 2-on-1 ankle pass,
      - half dracula,
      - double dracula,
    - exposure escalation:
      - single-heel exposure → dual-heel exposure → force reaction → finish.
- Key constraints to enforce
ына
  - Outside ashi: if exposure opens a turn-away lane, stop and rebuild hip governance before finishing.
  - Cross ashi: upgrade-first (pummel/pass) before finish attempts.
- Stress test focus
  - Outside ashi: partner attempts turn-away + roll during exposure.
  - Cross ashi: partner locks legs and attempts primary escape/extraction.

### 10.4 Week 4 — Endgame hubs: toe hold/top ushiro forcing, 50/50 gates and dilemmas, mutual ashi priority exits

- Session objective
  - Integrate secondary forcing tools (toe holds/top ushiro), solve 50/50 with internal gates and dilemma engines, and apply mutual ashi priority rules (“going last”) to exit into favorable hubs.
- Content spine
  - Toe holds:
    - belly-down vs belly-up exposure,
    - belly-down vs belly-up finishing mechanics,
    - toe hold → heel hook transition rule,
    - recapture knee tool,
    - calf slice switch (alternate constraint line),
    - toe hold ↔ knee bar dilemma (stall breaker).
  - Top ushiro:
    - entry and use as a hub for combined toe/heel exposure,
    - locked-legs problem solving using double trouble within this hub.
  - 50/50:
    - inside-knee position gate,
    - hand-fight constraint,
    - separation work,
    - dilemma pairs:
      - toe hold ↔ separation,
      - toe hold ↔ heel hook,
    - backside 50/50 transitions + follow mechanics.
  - Mutual ashi:
    - “going last” timing rule,
    - roll-through exit,
    - far-hip control concept during exits.
- Key constraints to enforce
  - 50/50 is solved in order: knee gate → grips → separation → dilemmas (do not skip the order).
  - Mutual ashi: avoid initiating first into equal access; win by sequencing and controlled exit.

### 10.5 Weekly structure template (how to run each week’s practice block)

- Warm-up (10–15 min)
  - Hub-specific entry/structure reps emphasizing “no separation” connection standard.
- Technical reps (20–30 min)
  - 1–2 core sequences for the week, drilled with immediate conversion on defense triggers (dilemma logic).
- Resistance rounds (10–15 min)
  - Positional sparring starting from the week’s primary hub with a defined defender objective (extract, roll, pressure, turn-away).
- Stress test (5–10 min)
  - Re-run the week’s stress test criteria and record whether structure survives the common defensive actions.


## 11.0 FAILURE PATTERNS

### 11.1 Inside-position failure: losing lanes while “attacking”

- What goes wrong
  - You initiate exposure/finishing while your feet/knees are not inside the opponent’s feet/knees.
  - You lose inside lanes mid-attack and continue anyway, turning the exchange into a mutual-attack race.
- Why it happens (structural cause)
  - Lane control is treated as “nice to have” rather than an attack-permission gate.
  - Focus shifts to heel/foot chasing; legs stop doing denial work.
- Typical symptoms
  - Opponent pummels inside and immediately gains their own entry to your legs.
  - You feel forced to rush finishing mechanics because the opponent is threatening counters.
- Corrections (decision rules)
  - If inside position is unclear or lost: pummel / re-win lanes first, then re-apply the threat engine.
  - If you can’t re-win inside lanes from the current hub: switch legs or transfer hubs rather than forcing.
- Drill fix
  - Start every positional round with a lane goal: first 10–15 seconds are lanes only; no grips/finishes until lanes are clearly won.

### 11.2 Connection failure: separation appears and you keep “working”

- What goes wrong
  - Partner pulls away and you allow daylight; you continue pulling on locks while the leg is already clearing.
- Why it happens
  - Treating the submission grip as “control” instead of treating body-to-body attachment and knee-line clamp as control.
- Typical symptoms
  - Foot/heel repeatedly slips out during normal withdrawal attempts.
  - You are constantly reaching and re-gripping instead of staying attached.
- Corrections
  - If separation appears: finishing attempt is over; rebuild entanglement structure first.
  - Re-run stress test logic: if the position does not survive simple withdrawal, do not invest in breaking mechanics.
- Drill fix
  - “No daylight” rounds: partner’s only job is to pull away; your only job is to stay attached (no finishing allowed).

### 11.3 Knee-line failure: allowing the opponent to clear before exposure is stabilized

- What goes wrong
  - The opponent’s knee line clears during exposure attempts, turning the position into foot chasing.
- Why it happens
  - You chase heel/foot early without first stabilizing the leg relationship and clamp.
- Typical symptoms
  - Exposure is momentary; heel appears then disappears as the knee line retracts.
  - You repeatedly “almost had it” but never get sustained exposure.
- Corrections
  - Treat knee-line governance as a prerequisite to exposure and breaking.
  - If the knee line is drifting free, stop the exposure attempt and re-secure the control layer.
- Drill fix
  - Knee-line retention rounds: attacker scores only by keeping the knee line trapped for time; not by finishing.

### 11.4 Forward-pressure failure: posture collapses and you try to “pull harder”

- What goes wrong
  - Opponent drives forward pressure into the entanglement; your posture collapses and your finish becomes weaker.
- Why it happens
  - Missing the structural solutions (elbow positioning; high hands/chin low; post-ashi wedge; directional belly-down option).
- Typical symptoms
  - Hands drop, chin rises; you feel compressed and lose leverage.
  - Heel slip accelerates because structure degrades under pressure.
- Corrections (selection rule)
  - If pressure threatens posture: apply elbow-position structure (hands high, chin low, elbow managed) before continuing.
  - If pressure remains dominant: build post-ashi wedge.
  - If the pressure/rotation dictates: accept belly-down line while maintaining knee-line control.
- Drill fix
  - Pressure rounds: defender’s only job is forward pressure; attacker’s job is to select the correct counter-family on time.

### 11.5 Heel-slip failure: “catching” the heel without anti-slip structure

- What goes wrong
  - Heel exposure is obtained briefly, but heel slips immediately; you re-catch repeatedly with no durable control.
- Why it happens
  - Exposure is treated as the finish; anti-heel-slip structure is not rebuilt after the slip begins.
- Typical symptoms
  - The heel slides out at the moment you apply finishing rotation or as the opponent pressures forward.
- Corrections (recovery rule)
  - As soon as heel slip starts: choose a recovery family (high-hands or roll-through) rather than “fight the slip” in place.
  - Recovery is only “complete” if it restores a state where the same defense cannot immediately re-strip the heel.
- Drill fix
  - Start reps from “heel starting to slip” and require the recovery to finish with stable exposure (not just a re-grip).

### 11.6 Roll failure: opponent rolls and you lose attachment (late chasing)

- What goes wrong
  - Defensive rolling creates separation; you end up reaching after the roll resolves.
- Why it happens
  - Lack of follow-the-leg habit; single-roll governance not applied; focus on hands instead of maintaining structural attachment.
- Typical symptoms
  - After a roll you are no longer connected at the knee line.
  - Opponent resets and you must rebuild from scratch repeatedly.
- Corrections
  - Treat rolling as expected; follow the leg during the roll.
  - If the roll is breaking your connection, treat it as a structural failure and reduce pace until attachment survives.
  - If the primary target clears during the roll: switch legs or transfer hubs rather than chasing late.
- Drill fix
  - Roll-only rounds: defender must roll; attacker must maintain attachment and re-land in control without re-gripping late.

### 11.7 Refusal-to-roll failure: stalling on a defended line instead of reconfiguring

- What goes wrong
  - Opponent refuses to roll and defends patiently; you persist on the same line until they peel and extract.
- Why it happens
  - Missing the forced reconfiguration solution (figure-four switch) and/or failing to execute it decisively.
- Typical symptoms
  - The position “feels stuck,” and time passes with no improved exposure.
  - Opponent peels and slowly clears the leg.
- Corrections
  - When refusal-to-roll defense stabilizes: execute the figure-four switch promptly and structurally (no slow transitions that open extraction windows).
- Drill fix
  - Defender is instructed “no rolling allowed”; attacker must hit the reconfiguration on a clear trigger.

### 11.8 Outside-ashi safety failure: heel exposure attempt gives a turn-away lane (back exposure risk)

- What goes wrong
  - You chase heel exposure and the opponent turns away; your back becomes exposed or your control collapses as they rotate.
- Why it happens
  - Hip governance is insufficient during the exposure moment; safety check is not treated as mandatory.
- Typical symptoms
  - The best exposure moments coincide with the opponent’s easiest turn-away opportunities.
- Corrections (safety hierarchy)
  - If exposure opens turn-away lane: stop and re-govern hips before reattempting exposure.
  - Choose exposure pathways only if they satisfy the back-exposure denial constraint.
- Drill fix
  - Outside-ashi safety rounds: defender’s goal is turn-away; attacker scores by preventing the turn-away lane while keeping exposure progression.

### 11.9 Cross-ashi “issues” failure: trying to finish before upgrading structure (pummeling/pass-a-leg skipped)

- What goes wrong
  - You attempt to finish from cross ashi while the known structural issues are unresolved; opponent clears/rotates out.
- Why it happens
  - Pummeling and passing-a-leg upgrades are treated as optional instead of mandatory problem-solving steps.
- Typical symptoms
  - You can enter cross ashi but cannot keep it long enough to expose reliably.
  - Exposure attempts repeatedly stall against leg locking or rotation.
- Corrections
  - Upgrade-first rule: pummel to re-win lanes, then pass-a-leg/lace/dracula to improve constraint, then expose, then finish.
  - If single-heel exposure is denied repeatedly: escalate to dual-heel exposure concept to force reactions.
- Drill fix
  - Cross-ashi ladder rounds: attacker must demonstrate pummel → pass-a-leg → exposure progression before finishing is allowed.

### 11.10 50/50 failure: skipping internal order (knee gate → grips → separation → dilemmas)

- What goes wrong
  - You attempt attacks without establishing inside-knee relationship or without winning the hand fight; you stall or get countered.
- Why it happens
  - Treating 50/50 like a normal ashi where grips alone create the finish; ignoring that symmetry requires internal gates.
- Typical symptoms
  - Attacks feel “blocked” and you cannot create separation.
  - Opponent wins the hand fight and you become the defender.
- Corrections (sequencing rule)
  - Fix inside-knee position first.
  - Solve hand fight second (win grips/deny grips).
  - Create separation third.
  - Then run dilemma pairs (toe hold ↔ separation; toe hold ↔ heel hook).
- Drill fix
  - Constraint rounds: attacker is not allowed to attack until each gate is demonstrated (coach/partner calls “gate met”).

### 11.11 Mutual-ashi failure: initiating first into equal access (losing the sequence)

- What goes wrong
  - You commit first without control advantage; opponent responds and wins the exchange.
- Why it happens
  - Ignoring the priority rule “going last” and treating mutual ashi like a normal unilateral attack hub.
- Typical symptoms
  - You feel you must rush because both have access, but your rush creates openings for counters.
- Corrections
  - Apply “going last”: induce/detect opponent commitment, then exit into advantage.
  - Use roll-through exit as a controlled transition (not disengagement) while keeping hip governance (far-hip control concept) so opponent cannot rotate free.
- Drill fix
  - Mutual timing rounds: attacker must “wait” for a partner commitment cue before executing exit; initiating first is scored as failure.


## 12.0 KEY PASSAGES

### 12.1 Inside-position battle as the governing priority (lanes decide offense/defense)

- Inside position (feet and knees inside the opponent’s feet and knees) is treated as the primary positional battle that determines who can attack legs first and who is forced into defense.
- Winning inside position functions as an attack-permission gate: if inside lanes are not won, forcing finishes becomes a race and invites counter-attacks.
- Inside lanes are not static; the system expects continuous pummeling and lane repair when the opponent re-enters lanes.

### 12.2 “No separation” as the definition of real control (entanglement quality standard)

- A stable entanglement is defined by the inability of the opponent to pull away and create daylight between bodies; if they can create separation, finishing attempts are premature.
- Stress tests are used as the validation mechanism: if basic withdrawal, pressure, or rolling repeatedly breaks the position, the correct response is rebuilding structure rather than attempting stronger breaking mechanics.

### 12.3 Achilles ↔ heel hook as the primary forcing engine (dilemma logic)

- Achilles pressure is used not only as a finish but as a forcing threat that produces predictable defensive reactions which open heel-hook exposure.
- Heel-hook threats are used to force defenses that reopen the Achilles bite; the system expects immediate conversion when defense stabilizes one line.
- The dilemma fails when either threat is not credible (poor connection on Achilles; unstable heel exposure that slips instantly).

### 12.4 Forward pressure is solved structurally (posture, elbow position, wedge, directional finish)

- Forward pressure is treated as a predictable defensive method that collapses posture and increases heel-slip risk.
- Structural responses (rather than “pull harder”) are emphasized:
  - elbow-position management (hands high; chin low; elbow controlled),
  - post-ashi wedge creation against crush,
  - belly-down finishing line when pressure/rotation dictates.

### 12.5 Heel slip is expected and is solved by named recovery families (not by improvisation)

- Heel slip is treated as a recurring event during exposure/finishing; recovery is a required skill, not an emergency improvisation.
- Two recovery families are emphasized:
  - high-hands style recovery (re-secure heel and restore alignment under forward pressure),
  - roll-through recovery (re-establish a stable entanglement when pressure + slip collapses structure).

### 12.6 Rolling is not an escape if attachment is maintained (follow + roll governance)

- Defensive rolling is treated as an expected response; the system’s default is to follow the leg and govern roll outcomes rather than accept resets.
- Single-roll governance is used as a framing principle: structure the position so rolling resolves into a predictable end state rather than infinite escape.

### 12.7 Cross-ashi issues are solved by upgrades (pummel and pass-a-leg), not by forcing breaks

- Cross ashi is presented with known structural issues; the correct approach is “upgrade-first”:
  - re-win inside lanes via pummeling,
  - apply passing-a-leg families (lace/dracula) to increase constraint and improve exposure.
- Dual-heel exposure functions as an escalation when single-heel hunting stalls, forcing reactions that reopen a clean finish line.

### 12.8 Outside-ashi requires a safety constraint: deny back exposure during exposure moments

- Outside-ashi heel exposure is pursued only with continuous denial of the opponent’s turn-away lane that would create back exposure.
- Any exposure method that opens an easy turn-away lane is treated as structurally incorrect and must be changed by re-governing hips and adjusting control before reattempting exposure.

### 12.9 50/50 is solved by internal gates and dilemma sequencing (order matters)

- 50/50 is treated as a symmetric hub requiring an internal order:
  - inside-knee position gate,
  - hand-fight/grip constraint,
  - separation work,
  - dilemma pairs (toe hold ↔ separation; toe hold ↔ heel hook),
  - backside 50/50 transitions and follow mechanics.
- Skipping the order leads to stalls or counters.

### 12.10 Mutual ashi is governed by priority sequencing (“going last”) and controlled exits

- Mutual ashi is treated as a special case where committing first can be a losing decision.
- “Going last” is presented as a priority rule: respond to the opponent’s commitment and exit mutuality into a favorable hub.
- Roll-through exits and far-hip control are used to convert mutual access into stable advantage rather than blind finishing races.


## 13.0 TERMINOLOGY

### 13.1 Positional hubs and entanglement names

  - Entanglement family with specific “issues” that must be solved via pummeling and positional upgrades before finishing attempts become reliable.
- 50/50
  - Symmetric entanglement hub requiring internal rules (inside-knee position, separation, hand-fight solutions) and dilemma stacking to prevent stalemate.
- Mutual Ashi
  - Mutual-entanglement problem class where both players have access; governed by timing/priority rules (notably “going last”) and controlled exits.
- Butterfly Ashi
  - Entanglement variant used as a transition from irimi when geometry/pressure makes it the better platform.
- Stretch Ashi
  - Entanglement/structure referenced as a response to primary leg escape attempts (used to maintain attachment and prevent full extraction).

  - 50/50 configuration/transition space used to maintain advantage through opponent movement and to continue attacks as the opponent turns/rolls.
- Cross Waist 50/50
  - 50/50 configuration variant referenced as part of the 50/50 subsystem.

### 13.2 Exposure and orientation language

- Heel exposure
  - The state where the heel is available to be secured for heel-hook finishing mechanics; treated as something you create and stabilize from control, not something you “grab and hope.”
- Belly-down
  - Orientation used for both exposure and finishing mechanics (notably Achilles/toe-hold lines) when opponent pressure/rotation dictates that finishing vector.
- Belly-up
  - Orientation used for toe-hold exposure/finishing when the geometry supports it without needing to turn belly-down.
- Posture “kneeling opponent”
  - Scenario label for exposure mechanics that apply specifically when the opponent is kneeling rather than standing/squared.

### 13.3 Control structures and control mechanics labels

- Inside position (inside lanes)
  - Priority condition defined as keeping feet and knees inside the opponent’s feet and knees; treated as the core positional battle that drives offense/defense access.
- Inside knee position
  - Specific 50/50 requirement: an internal structural gate that must be achieved/maintained for the hub to function safely and effectively.
- Knee line
  - The line/threshold governing whether the opponent can withdraw/clear their leg; treated as a control prerequisite before exposure and breaking become reliable.
- Hip control
  - Control requirement used to stabilize exposure and prevent rotation/turn-away; emphasized particularly in outside-ashi.
- Leg scissoring (hip scissoring)
  - Named hip-control method for outside-ashi to limit hip mobility and stabilize exposure.
- Cross shin
  - Named hip-control method for outside-ashi to pin/steer hips while building/maintaining heel exposure.
- Post ashi
  - Named structure used against forward pressure (includes placing a foot to the hip and creating a wedge platform) to prevent collapse and enable stronger breaking.
- Post feet
  - Named exposure/control format referenced within outside-ashi heel exposure pathways.

### 13.4 Named dilemmas and “engine” pairings

- Achilles / Heel Hook dilemma
  - Forcing pair: Achilles threat drives predictable defense that opens heel exposure; heel-hook threat drives defense that reopens Achilles pressure/bite.
- Toe hold / Separation dilemma
  - Forcing pair (notably in 50/50): toe-hold threat interferes with clean separation; separation attempts create alignment that reopens toe-hold opportunities.
- Toe hold / Heel hook dilemma
  - Forcing pair: toe-hold threat changes alignment/rotation that exposes heel-hook lines; heel-hook defense can reopen toe-hold control.
- Toe hold / Knee bar dilemma
  - Forcing pair used to defeat “locked” or stabilized defenses by switching to the paired break line when the opponent over-commits to defending the first line.
- Double Trouble
  - Two-leg constraint method used to counter “locked legs” and other stall states by controlling/threatening both legs to force openings.

### 13.5 Transitions, escapes, and continuity language

- Extraction
  - Defensive action: opponent withdraws/clears the trapped leg (often by pulling away and attempting to clear the knee line).
- General escape directions
  - Umbrella label for the opponent’s main defensive vectors (withdrawal/extraction, rotation/roll, pressure-based defense, heel slip).
- Following a leg
  - Continuity rule: maintain attachment to the moving target leg through opponent movement (rolls, turns, withdrawals) rather than losing connection and re-gripping late.
- Switching legs
  - Continuity rule: when the primary target leg clears or becomes non-viable, transfer to the other leg or to a new hub rather than resetting.
- Single roll theory
  - Roll-governance framing: structure the position so the opponent’s roll resolves into a controllable outcome rather than infinite rolling escape.
- Rolling through (roll-through)
  - Recovery/transition method used when pressure and/or heel slip collapses the structure; roll to re-establish a stable entanglement rather than fight from collapse.
- Going last
  - Mutual-ashi priority rule: avoid committing first into equal access; respond to the opponent’s commitment to exit mutuality into advantage.

  - Positional hub introduced as part of the toe-hold volume; used to create heel-hook and toe-hold exposure and to defeat locked-leg defenses via constraint methods.
- Moving to Top Ushiro

## 14.0 ADDITIONAL NOTES

### 14.1 System identity: a hub-and-engine leglock game (positions as platforms, dilemmas as forcing)

- The system is structured around:
  - named entanglement hubs (irimi/outside/cross/50-50/mutual/top-ushiro) that each change control/exposure geometry,
  - forcing engines (dilemma pairs) that convert opponent defense into new exposure.
- Practical implication:
  - “Knowing moves” is insufficient; success depends on consistently applying:
    - inside-position lane control,
    - connection/no-separation standard,
    - control-layer prerequisites (knee line + hips),
    - immediate conversions when the defense closes a line.

### 14.2 Control-first philosophy: exposure is not a finish, it is a state you stabilize

- Repeated emphasis appears via:
  - stress tests (prove the position is real before finishing),
  - heel-slip recovery (assume exposure attempts will be contested),
  - roll-following (assume opponent will try to move to escape).
- Practical reading:
  - The system treats “exposure without stability” as false exposure (it will not survive resistance).

### 14.3 Why inside position is elevated to a “master gate”

- Inside lanes determine:
  - who can enter first,
  - who must defend,
  - whether exchanges become mutual-attack races.
- The system repeatedly routes back to lane repair (pummeling) when lanes are lost.
- Practical training implication:
  - Dedicated lane-only rounds are a high leverage training tool because they build the true permission structure for attacks.

### 14.4 Why “no separation” is treated as the defining control metric (and why stress tests matter)

- The stress test concept is used to prevent:
  - false confidence (positions that only work when the opponent is passive),
  - premature focus on breaking mechanics when the platform is unstable.
- “No separation” functions as a universal quality filter:
  - if the opponent can pull away and create daylight, they can usually clear the leg line eventually.
- Practical implication:
  - Measuring entanglement quality by “could I finish a compliant partner” is replaced by “could they extract if they try.”

### 14.5 Dilemma logic as the system’s conversion engine (what makes it work vs fail)

- Dilemma success depends on two prerequisites:
  - both threats are credible (they require real defensive action),
  - conversion happens early (defense trigger causes immediate switch).
- Dilemma failure patterns are consistent:
  - one threat is not credible (e.g., Achilles without tight connection; heel exposure that slips immediately),
  - conversion is delayed (attacker insists on the defended line until defense stabilizes).

### 14.6 Risk management: outside-ashi back-exposure denial is not optional

- Outside-ashi is treated as a “higher exposure, higher constraint” hub:
  - heel exposure is more available,
  - but it is only usable if hip governance denies turn-away/back exposure routes.
- Practical implication:
  - Outside-ashi training should explicitly score:
    - “exposure created while denying turn-away” (success),
    - “exposure created but turn-away lane opened” (failure, even if heel was briefly caught).

### 14.7 Cross-ashi as an “upgrade-first” subsystem (why passing-a-leg families exist)

- Cross-ashi is presented with known “issues” that require upgrades:
  - pummeling to re-win lanes,
  - passing-a-leg families (lace/dracula) to increase constraint and force exposure.
- The system treats “upgrade-first” as the correct default:
  - if exposure is not stable, upgrade structure rather than force finish attempts.
- Dual-heel exposure is framed as an escalation tool:
  - when one-heel hunting stalls, expose both to force reactions.

### 14.8 Toe hold/top-ushiro as an escalation layer against stalls and locked legs

- Toe hold is treated as:
  - a finish line,
  - a forcing threat that creates heel-hook conversion opportunities,
  - a dilemma partner (toe hold ↔ heel hook; toe hold ↔ separation; toe hold ↔ knee bar).
- Top ushiro is positioned as:
  - a hub that supports combined toe/heel exposure,
  - a method to defeat locked-leg defenses when lower hubs stall.

### 14.9 50/50 is solved by internal order (gates and sequencing, not improvisation)

- The system frames 50/50 as:
  - symmetry plus constraints: inside-knee positioning, hand-fight, separation.
- The order is treated as a required sequence:
  - knee gate → grip/hand-fight solution → separation → dilemma pairs → transitions (backside 50/50) → follow mechanics.
- Practical implication:
  - 50/50 training should be organized as “gates first,” not as “try heel hooks from 50/50.”

### 14.10 Mutual ashi is a timing problem (priority rule decides winner)

- Mutual ashi is framed as:
  - both have access; initiating first can be a mistake.
- “Going last” is treated as a priority rule that:
  - reduces reactive counter risk,
  - increases the chance that your action resolves the exchange into advantage.
- Roll-through exits plus hip governance (far-hip control concept) are the conversion mechanism:
  - mutuality is solved by exiting into a favorable hub, not by accepting mutual finishing races.

### 14.11 Reading/usage guidance for this BIO (how to consume it efficiently)

- Recommended consumption order for training use (derived from how the system itself prioritizes constraints)
  - Start with Section 7 (Diagram set) to get the hub/engine overview.
  - Then Section 6 (Technique library) to understand each hub’s toolset and dilemma logic.
  - Then Section 11 (Failure patterns) to identify what must be trained to prevent collapse under resistance.
  - Then Section 9 (Drilling progressions) to convert system rules into training steps.
  - Then Section 8 (Application scenarios) to map the tools to opponent behaviors.
- Practical note
  - This order matches the system’s internal logic (gates/constraints → engines → outcomes) rather than reading chronologically by volume.


## 15.0 SUPPLEMENT (NOT TRANSCRIPT-DERIVED) (optional)

### 15.1 Clarifying cross-domain naming consistency (safety note for transcripts)

- Some labels in transcripts (especially auto-transcribed) may appear inconsistent (e.g., “irimi/inside ashi,” “cross/shoelace,” “ushiro” spelling variants).
- Suggested handling rule
  - Preserve transcript language inside the BIO when it is clear what is meant.
  - When a term is obviously corrupted, normalize to the most standard label but keep the transcript token in parentheses once (e.g., “Top Ushiro (top ushiro)”) so future searches still find it.
- Rationale
  - Keeps fidelity while preventing the system map from fragmenting into duplicate nodes caused by transcription noise.

### 15.2 Practical “minimum viable training loop” (fast start without losing the system)

- Loop structure (repeat weekly)
  - 10 min: lanes + connection standard (no attacks).
  - 15 min: one hub’s control platform reps (e.g., irimi ashi structure + stress test).
  - 15 min: one dilemma pair reps (Achilles ↔ heel hook or toe hold ↔ heel hook).
  - 10 min: positional resistance from the hub with defender using one scripted defense (extract OR roll OR forward pressure).
  - 10 min: failure review: identify which of the three defenses broke the structure and repair that constraint next session.
- Intended benefit
  - Preserves the system’s “control-first” identity while letting you progress quickly without needing to cover all hubs at once.

### 15.3 Optional tagging method for future VN/SYS promotion (workflow aid)

- When promoting content into SYS pages later, a lightweight tag scheme can prevent bloat:
  - [GATE]: inside position, inside-knee gate, hand-fight gate, separation gate.
  - [CONTROL]: knee line, hip governance, anti-turn-away, anti-heel-slip.
  - [ENGINE]: dilemma pairs (Achilles↔HH, ToeHold↔HH, ToeHold↔Sep, ToeHold↔KB), double trouble.
  - [CONTINUITY]: follow leg, switch legs, single roll, roll-through.
  - [RISK]: back exposure, pressure collapse, heel slip, locked legs.
- Use
  - Add tags only when extracting to SYS, not inside the main BIO, to keep BIO clean while keeping SYS searchable.

### 15.4 Coverage completeness note (strictly about this BIO build)

- This BIO was generated from the provided transcript for “Systematically Attacking the Legs” and the chapter title list you supplied; if future volumes/transcripts are added, update Section 3 and Section 6 accordingly.
