## 4.0 CORE CONCEPTS

### 4.1 Finishing competence must exist on both heel-hook sides (inside + outside)

- Inside heel hooks are treated as mechanically high-percentage, but the system explicitly requires you to be able to finish from both inside and outside heel-hook contexts.
  - If you can only finish one side, the opponent can steer exchanges into the side you cannot finish and reduce your overall effectiveness.
- The “finish both sides” requirement is framed as a strategic constraint: positional choices, pummeling, and transitions must preserve access to at least one credible breaking direction.

### 4.2 The inside-position battle is the first gate to winning leg-lock exchanges

- Inside position is defined as keeping your feet and knees inside the opponent’s feet and knees.
  - When your legs occupy the inside lane, you can access their legs while simultaneously blocking their access to yours.
- Exchange rule: winning inside position precedes meaningful offense.
  - If inside position is not clearly won, the immediate task is pummeling and re-organization before committing to finishing attempts.
- Inside position is treated as a positional “permission slip” for attack initiation, not a minor detail.

### 4.3 Control sequencing: inside position → knee-line/hip control → exposure → breaking mechanics

- The system repeatedly enforces a sequence rather than “submission-first” thinking.
  - Inside position establishes access and denial.
  - Control layers stabilize the entanglement so exposure can be created without giving the opponent an easy clear/escape.
  - Exposure is then converted into breaking mechanics rather than forcing breaks from poor alignment.
- Practical implication: when finishes fail, the error is often a skipped layer (attempting to break before exposure, or attempting exposure before stabilizing control).

### 4.4 Dilemma architecture is the engine (not single-technique attempts)

- Achilles ↔ heel hook is presented as a recurring forcing dilemma.
  - The objective is to create a situation where defending one line predictably opens the other line.
- Later volumes extend dilemma logic into toe-hold-driven dilemmas (toe hold ↔ heel hook; toe hold ↔ separation) to prevent opponents from choosing “safe” defensive lines.

### 4.5 Heel exposure is built through specific control tools, not wishful pulling

- Exposure is treated as a constructed state: you create it by controlling hips, knee line, and the opponent’s ability to rotate/clear.
- Outside-ashi emphasizes controlling the hips as the route to reliable heel exposure while preventing the opponent from escaping by turning away and exposing your back.
- Multiple exposure formats are treated as distinct pathways (belly-up vs belly-down exposures), each with different control requirements and finish vectors.

### 4.6 Back-exposure denial is a non-negotiable constraint in outside-ashi

- Outside-ashi offense is paired with explicit constraints to deny back exposure.
  - Control choices are evaluated by whether they keep you safe from the opponent turning away and taking your back during exposure/finishing attempts.
- Practical implication: if you can expose the heel but your structure gives the opponent a clear path to your back, the exposure pathway is treated as incorrect or incomplete.

### 4.7 Rolling is an expected defensive tool; continuity must be built into the system

- Defensive rolling is assumed; the system includes explicit “follow” and “switch” concepts to maintain attachment through rotation.
- Single-roll theory provides a framework for when and how the opponent’s roll resolves, and how you stay connected without being pulled into poor alignment.
- Follow-the-leg and switching-legs concepts are treated as continuity tools:
  - If the target leg clears, re-attach to the other leg or re-entangle rather than accepting a reset.

### 4.8 Heel slip is treated as a recurring defensive problem with explicit counters

- Heel slippage is presented as a realistic defensive response during finishing.
- The system includes specific counter families (high-hands recovery and roll-through recovery) to re-secure the heel and preserve breaking alignment when the heel begins to escape.

### 4.9 Cross-ashi is defined by leg-position structure and pummeling, with predictable problem sets

- Cross-ashi is introduced with explicit leg-position definitions and predictable “issues” that must be solved.
- The system uses leg pummeling as the core method to improve position and re-open exposure routes rather than forcing attacks from a losing configuration.
- Cross-ashi offense is framed as a progression:
  - Achilles-based threats and figure-4 structures → transitions into heel-hook exposure → lace/dracula families → follow-the-roll continuation to prevent escapes.

### 4.10 Passing-the-leg and dual-heel exposure are treated as strategic upgrades (not “extra moves”)

- Passing a leg (including 2-on-1 ankle control and dracula-family passing variants) is used to improve the exposure and control landscape.
- Dual-heel exposure is treated as a meaningful escalation: controlling both heels increases constraint on the opponent and improves your ability to force a breaking decision.

### 4.11 50/50 and mutual entanglements require explicit priority rules (hand fighting and “going last”)

- 50/50 is treated as a hand-fighting and separation problem, not simply a leg-entanglement “position you arrive in.”
  - Grip battles and separation dilemmas dictate whether attacks can be launched safely.
- Mutual ashi is presented as an entanglement where priority rules matter.
  - “Going last” is framed as a key concept: sequencing and timing determine who wins exchanges when both players have comparable access.

### 4.12 “Stress test” thinking: mechanics must survive resistance checks

- Stress tests are used to validate that:
  - inside position is truly won,
  - the entanglement is tight enough to deny clearing/extraction,
  - exposure can be achieved without giving back exposure,
  - breaking mechanics remain available under active defense (rolls, heel slip, posture changes).

## 5.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### 5.1 System objective and constraints (what the system is optimizing for)

- Win leg-lock exchanges by consistently creating positions where you can attack their legs while they have reduced access to your legs (asymmetry preference).
- Treat symmetrical entanglements (notably 50/50) as “high-knowledge” positions: usable, but only if you can solve the equal-access problems with explicit internal rules (separation, inside-knee position, hand-fight priorities, and dilemma stacking).
- Require credible finishing mechanics on both inside and outside heel hooks so the opponent cannot steer you into the side where you are weakest.

### 5.2 Phased model (what must happen, in order)

- Phase 1 — Acquire a controlled leg position (entanglement as the control platform)
  - Establish ashi/entanglement structure with the knee line secured and hips controlled enough that the opponent cannot easily clear/extract.
- Phase 2 — Create exposure from control (heel/foot/knee exposure is built, not grabbed)
  - Use hip control + leg position + angle to force the heel/foot into an exposed state that you can keep through movement.
- Phase 3 — Apply breaking mechanics to the exposed structure
  - Separate “having exposure” from “being aligned to break”; finish only when alignment + control + opponent rotation are governed.
- Phase 4 — Continuity when defense triggers movement
  - When the opponent rolls, slips the heel, or clears the primary leg line, the system response is follow/reattach/transfer rather than reset.

### 5.3 Positional taxonomy (the hub set the system rotates through)

- Irimi Ashi Garami hub (primary entry/control + Achilles-first threat platform)
  - Used to build stable control, then force predictable reactions with the Achilles ↔ heel hook dilemma.
  - Includes explicit solutions for common structural problems (extraction attempts, forward pressure into the entanglement, heel slip).
- Outside Ashi hub (heel exposure platform with explicit back-exposure constraints)
  - Used when the angle/structure favors heel exposure but requires strict control rules to prevent the opponent turning away and generating back exposure.
  - Uses hip-control methods (e.g., scissoring and cross-shin style hip control) to keep exposure stable as the opponent changes posture (builds to knee, rotates, rolls).
- Cross Ashi / Shoelace hub (pummeling + passing-a-leg upgrades to improve exposure)
  - Cross-ashi is treated as a position with known issues that must be solved via leg pummeling and positional upgrades before forcing breaks.
  - Shoelace and “passing the leg” families (lace/dracula families) are used to change the opponent’s defensive options and expose one or both heels.
- Toe Hold / Top Ushiro hub (alternate break family + transition engine)
  - Toe holds are treated as a full subsystem with belly-up and belly-down exposure/finish mechanics.
  - Toe-hold threats are used to force transitions into heel-hook opportunities; top ushiro functions as an exposure platform that connects toe hold and heel hook threats and solves “locked-leg” stall states.
- 50/50 hub (symmetry endgame with explicit internal rules)
  - Requires internal gates (inside-knee positioning, separation strategy, and hand-fighting solutions) to make attacks safe and repeatable.
  - Uses dilemma pairs to prevent the opponent from choosing “stall/separate” as a safe outcome (toe hold ↔ separation; toe hold ↔ heel hook).
- Mutual Ashi hub (mutual entanglement priority rules)
  - Treated as a distinct problem class where sequencing/priority determines who wins exchanges; “going last” is used as an organizing rule for how to move out of mutuality into advantage.

### 5.4 Primary control gates (what decides whether you’re allowed to attack)

- Inside-position gate (feet/knees lane control)
  - Winning inside position (feet and knees inside the opponent’s feet and knees) is treated as the prerequisite for safe offense because it simultaneously grants access and denies their access.
  - If inside position is not won, the task is pummeling and re-organization rather than forcing breaks from a losing lane.
- Knee-line governance
  - Control of how deep the opponent’s knee can escape (and how much of the leg they can withdraw) is treated as a prerequisite for both exposure and finishing; if the knee line clears too early, offense collapses into resets.
- Hip-control governance
  - Hip control is treated as the stabilizer that makes exposure repeatable; if the opponent’s hips are free to rotate/turn away, exposures become transient and back-exposure risk rises (especially in outside-ashi).

### 5.5 Attack engines (how the system forces openings instead of “hoping”)

- Achilles ↔ heel hook dilemma (recurring primary engine)
  - Use Achilles threats to force predictable defenses that expose heel-hook lines; use heel-hook threats to force defensive alignments that reopen Achilles bites.
- Toe hold dilemmas (secondary engines that prevent stalling/separation)
  - Toe hold ↔ heel hook: toe-hold threat changes alignment/rotation in a way that opens heel exposure.
  - Toe hold ↔ separation (notably in 50/50): toe-hold threat forces reactions that prevent “clean separation” as a safe default.
- Two-leg constraint (double trouble)
  - Used when the opponent locks legs or freezes the entanglement to deny exposure; controlling/threatening both legs is used to force reactions that reopen a breakable line.

### 5.6 Defensive model (what the opponent will try, and the system’s default responses)

- Extraction / clearing the leg
  - System response: keep attachment and re-establish inside position lanes; upgrade/transfer to a hub that restores control rather than chasing the foot with no structure.
- Forward pressure into the entanglement
  - System response: structural frames and positional adjustments (including elbow/ashi positioning and post-ashi style structures) and directional finishes (e.g., belly-down Achilles line) when pressure forces that finishing vector.
- Defensive rolling
  - System response: treat rolling as expected; use roll theory + follow mechanics so the roll resolves into maintained attachment rather than reset.
- Heel slip
  - System response: treat heel slip as recurring; use explicit recovery families (high-hands style recovery and roll-through style recovery) to re-secure the heel and restore breaking alignment.
- “Locked legs” / stalemate
  - System response: apply multi-leg constraints (double trouble) and/or dilemma escalation (toe hold/knee bar pairing where applicable) to force openings.

### 5.7 Continuity rules (how the system stays connected through movement)

- Follow-the-leg rule
  - When the opponent rotates/rolls, maintain attachment to the moving leg rather than re-gripping late after the leg has cleared.
- Switching-legs rule
  - If the primary target leg clears, transfer to the other leg (or transfer entanglement family) to keep offense alive rather than restarting from zero.
- “Single-roll” framing (roll resolution constraint)
  - Rolling is treated as a solvable constraint problem: the system aims to structure the position so the opponent cannot roll indefinitely without giving you a re-entanglement or exposure outcome.

### 5.8 Training validation (how the system encodes reliability)

- Drills are used to encode the base positioning, attachment, and finishing alignment (including specific Achilles-focused drill blocks and foundational position drilling).
- Stress tests are used as resistance checks to confirm the control layer is real before investing in breaking mechanics (position survives extraction attempts, heel slip attempts, and rolling attempts).
