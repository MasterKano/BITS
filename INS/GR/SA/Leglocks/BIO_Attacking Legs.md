## 4.0 CORE CONCEPTS

### 4.1 Finishing competence must exist on both heel-hook sides (inside + outside)

- Inside heel hooks are treated as mechanically high-percentage, but the system explicitly requires you to be able to finish from both inside and outside heel-hook contexts.
  - If you can only finish one side, the opponent can steer exchanges into the side you cannot finish and reduce your overall effectiveness.
- The “finish both sides” requirement is framed as a strategic constraint: positional choices, pummeling, and transitions must preserve access to at least one credible breaking direction.

### 4.2 The inside-position battle is the first gate to winning leg-lock exchanges

- Inside position is defined as keeping your feet and knees inside the opponent’s feet and knees.
  - When your legs occupy the inside lane, you can access their legs while simultaneously blocking their access to yours.
- Exchange rule: winning inside position precedes meaningful offense.
  - If inside position is not clearly won, the immediate task is pummeling and re-organization before committing to finishing attempts.
- Inside position is treated as a positional “permission slip” for attack initiation, not a minor detail.

### 4.3 Control sequencing: inside position → knee-line/hip control → exposure → breaking mechanics

- The system repeatedly enforces a sequence rather than “submission-first” thinking.
  - Inside position establishes access and denial.
  - Control layers stabilize the entanglement so exposure can be created without giving the opponent an easy clear/escape.
  - Exposure is then converted into breaking mechanics rather than forcing breaks from poor alignment.
- Practical implication: when finishes fail, the error is often a skipped layer (attempting to break before exposure, or attempting exposure before stabilizing control).

### 4.4 Dilemma architecture is the engine (not single-technique attempts)

- Achilles ↔ heel hook is presented as a recurring forcing dilemma.
  - The objective is to create a situation where defending one line predictably opens the other line.
- Later volumes extend dilemma logic into toe-hold-driven dilemmas (toe hold ↔ heel hook; toe hold ↔ separation) to prevent opponents from choosing “safe” defensive lines.

### 4.5 Heel exposure is built through specific control tools, not wishful pulling

- Exposure is treated as a constructed state: you create it by controlling hips, knee line, and the opponent’s ability to rotate/clear.
- Outside-ashi emphasizes controlling the hips as the route to reliable heel exposure while preventing the opponent from escaping by turning away and exposing your back.
- Multiple exposure formats are treated as distinct pathways (belly-up vs belly-down exposures), each with different control requirements and finish vectors.

### 4.6 Back-exposure denial is a non-negotiable constraint in outside-ashi

- Outside-ashi offense is paired with explicit constraints to deny back exposure.
  - Control choices are evaluated by whether they keep you safe from the opponent turning away and taking your back during exposure/finishing attempts.
- Practical implication: if you can expose the heel but your structure gives the opponent a clear path to your back, the exposure pathway is treated as incorrect or incomplete.

### 4.7 Rolling is an expected defensive tool; continuity must be built into the system

- Defensive rolling is assumed; the system includes explicit “follow” and “switch” concepts to maintain attachment through rotation.
- Single-roll theory provides a framework for when and how the opponent’s roll resolves, and how you stay connected without being pulled into poor alignment.
- Follow-the-leg and switching-legs concepts are treated as continuity tools:
  - If the target leg clears, re-attach to the other leg or re-entangle rather than accepting a reset.

### 4.8 Heel slip is treated as a recurring defensive problem with explicit counters

- Heel slippage is presented as a realistic defensive response during finishing.
- The system includes specific counter families (high-hands recovery and roll-through recovery) to re-secure the heel and preserve breaking alignment when the heel begins to escape.

### 4.9 Cross-ashi is defined by leg-position structure and pummeling, with predictable problem sets

- Cross-ashi is introduced with explicit leg-position definitions and predictable “issues” that must be solved.
- The system uses leg pummeling as the core method to improve position and re-open exposure routes rather than forcing attacks from a losing configuration.
- Cross-ashi offense is framed as a progression:
  - Achilles-based threats and figure-4 structures → transitions into heel-hook exposure → lace/dracula families → follow-the-roll continuation to prevent escapes.

### 4.10 Passing-the-leg and dual-heel exposure are treated as strategic upgrades (not “extra moves”)

- Passing a leg (including 2-on-1 ankle control and dracula-family passing variants) is used to improve the exposure and control landscape.
- Dual-heel exposure is treated as a meaningful escalation: controlling both heels increases constraint on the opponent and improves your ability to force a breaking decision.

### 4.11 50/50 and mutual entanglements require explicit priority rules (hand fighting and “going last”)

- 50/50 is treated as a hand-fighting and separation problem, not simply a leg-entanglement “position you arrive in.”
  - Grip battles and separation dilemmas dictate whether attacks can be launched safely.
- Mutual ashi is presented as an entanglement where priority rules matter.
  - “Going last” is framed as a key concept: sequencing and timing determine who wins exchanges when both players have comparable access.

### 4.12 “Stress test” thinking: mechanics must survive resistance checks

- Stress tests are used to validate that:
  - inside position is truly won,
  - the entanglement is tight enough to deny clearing/extraction,
  - exposure can be achieved without giving back exposure,
  - breaking mechanics remain available under active defense (rolls, heel slip, posture changes).

## 5.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### 5.1 System objective and constraints (what the system is optimizing for)

- Win leg-lock exchanges by consistently creating positions where you can attack their legs while they have reduced access to your legs (asymmetry preference).
- Treat symmetrical entanglements (notably 50/50) as “high-knowledge” positions: usable, but only if you can solve the equal-access problems with explicit internal rules (separation, inside-knee position, hand-fight priorities, and dilemma stacking).
- Require credible finishing mechanics on both inside and outside heel hooks so the opponent cannot steer you into the side where you are weakest.

### 5.2 Phased model (what must happen, in order)

- Phase 1 — Acquire a controlled leg position (entanglement as the control platform)
  - Establish ashi/entanglement structure with the knee line secured and hips controlled enough that the opponent cannot easily clear/extract.
- Phase 2 — Create exposure from control (heel/foot/knee exposure is built, not grabbed)
  - Use hip control + leg position + angle to force the heel/foot into an exposed state that you can keep through movement.
- Phase 3 — Apply breaking mechanics to the exposed structure
  - Separate “having exposure” from “being aligned to break”; finish only when alignment + control + opponent rotation are governed.
- Phase 4 — Continuity when defense triggers movement
  - When the opponent rolls, slips the heel, or clears the primary leg line, the system response is follow/reattach/transfer rather than reset.

### 5.3 Positional taxonomy (the hub set the system rotates through)

- Irimi Ashi Garami hub (primary entry/control + Achilles-first threat platform)
  - Used to build stable control, then force predictable reactions with the Achilles ↔ heel hook dilemma.
  - Includes explicit solutions for common structural problems (extraction attempts, forward pressure into the entanglement, heel slip).
- Outside Ashi hub (heel exposure platform with explicit back-exposure constraints)
  - Used when the angle/structure favors heel exposure but requires strict control rules to prevent the opponent turning away and generating back exposure.
  - Uses hip-control methods (e.g., scissoring and cross-shin style hip control) to keep exposure stable as the opponent changes posture (builds to knee, rotates, rolls).
- Cross Ashi / Shoelace hub (pummeling + passing-a-leg upgrades to improve exposure)
  - Cross-ashi is treated as a position with known issues that must be solved via leg pummeling and positional upgrades before forcing breaks.
  - Shoelace and “passing the leg” families (lace/dracula families) are used to change the opponent’s defensive options and expose one or both heels.
- Toe Hold / Top Ushiro hub (alternate break family + transition engine)
  - Toe holds are treated as a full subsystem with belly-up and belly-down exposure/finish mechanics.
  - Toe-hold threats are used to force transitions into heel-hook opportunities; top ushiro functions as an exposure platform that connects toe hold and heel hook threats and solves “locked-leg” stall states.
- 50/50 hub (symmetry endgame with explicit internal rules)
  - Requires internal gates (inside-knee positioning, separation strategy, and hand-fighting solutions) to make attacks safe and repeatable.
  - Uses dilemma pairs to prevent the opponent from choosing “stall/separate” as a safe outcome (toe hold ↔ separation; toe hold ↔ heel hook).
- Mutual Ashi hub (mutual entanglement priority rules)
  - Treated as a distinct problem class where sequencing/priority determines who wins exchanges; “going last” is used as an organizing rule for how to move out of mutuality into advantage.

### 5.4 Primary control gates (what decides whether you’re allowed to attack)

- Inside-position gate (feet/knees lane control)
  - Winning inside position (feet and knees inside the opponent’s feet and knees) is treated as the prerequisite for safe offense because it simultaneously grants access and denies their access.
  - If inside position is not won, the task is pummeling and re-organization rather than forcing breaks from a losing lane.
- Knee-line governance
  - Control of how deep the opponent’s knee can escape (and how much of the leg they can withdraw) is treated as a prerequisite for both exposure and finishing; if the knee line clears too early, offense collapses into resets.
- Hip-control governance
  - Hip control is treated as the stabilizer that makes exposure repeatable; if the opponent’s hips are free to rotate/turn away, exposures become transient and back-exposure risk rises (especially in outside-ashi).

### 5.5 Attack engines (how the system forces openings instead of “hoping”)

- Achilles ↔ heel hook dilemma (recurring primary engine)
  - Use Achilles threats to force predictable defenses that expose heel-hook lines; use heel-hook threats to force defensive alignments that reopen Achilles bites.
- Toe hold dilemmas (secondary engines that prevent stalling/separation)
  - Toe hold ↔ heel hook: toe-hold threat changes alignment/rotation in a way that opens heel exposure.
  - Toe hold ↔ separation (notably in 50/50): toe-hold threat forces reactions that prevent “clean separation” as a safe default.
- Two-leg constraint (double trouble)
  - Used when the opponent locks legs or freezes the entanglement to deny exposure; controlling/threatening both legs is used to force reactions that reopen a breakable line.

### 5.6 Defensive model (what the opponent will try, and the system’s default responses)

- Extraction / clearing the leg
  - System response: keep attachment and re-establish inside position lanes; upgrade/transfer to a hub that restores control rather than chasing the foot with no structure.
- Forward pressure into the entanglement
  - System response: structural frames and positional adjustments (including elbow/ashi positioning and post-ashi style structures) and directional finishes (e.g., belly-down Achilles line) when pressure forces that finishing vector.
- Defensive rolling
  - System response: treat rolling as expected; use roll theory + follow mechanics so the roll resolves into maintained attachment rather than reset.
- Heel slip
  - System response: treat heel slip as recurring; use explicit recovery families (high-hands style recovery and roll-through style recovery) to re-secure the heel and restore breaking alignment.
- “Locked legs” / stalemate
  - System response: apply multi-leg constraints (double trouble) and/or dilemma escalation (toe hold/knee bar pairing where applicable) to force openings.

### 5.7 Continuity rules (how the system stays connected through movement)

- Follow-the-leg rule
  - When the opponent rotates/rolls, maintain attachment to the moving leg rather than re-gripping late after the leg has cleared.
- Switching-legs rule
  - If the primary target leg clears, transfer to the other leg (or transfer entanglement family) to keep offense alive rather than restarting from zero.
- “Single-roll” framing (roll resolution constraint)
  - Rolling is treated as a solvable constraint problem: the system aims to structure the position so the opponent cannot roll indefinitely without giving you a re-entanglement or exposure outcome.

### 5.8 Training validation (how the system encodes reliability)

- Drills are used to encode the base positioning, attachment, and finishing alignment (including specific Achilles-focused drill blocks and foundational position drilling).
- Stress tests are used as resistance checks to confirm the control layer is real before investing in breaking mechanics (position survives extraction attempts, heel slip attempts, and rolling attempts).


## 6.0 TECHNIQUE LIBRARY

### 6.1 Volume 1 — Foundations (positions, gates, continuity tools, drills, submission concept families)

#### 6.1.1 Strategic position map (entanglement progression and what each is “for”)

- Primary hub sequence (as a learning spine): irimi ashi → outside ashi → cross ashi → inside ashi → 50/50 → mutual ashi
  - The value is not “knowing names,” but understanding how each position changes:
    - who has inside position,
    - what the opponent’s best escape direction is,
    - whether heel exposure is easy/hard,
    - how much back-exposure risk exists during exposure/finishing.
- Irimi ashi (strategy frame)
  - Built to protect from counter-offense while you build offense (less back-exposure risk).
  - Breaking mechanics can be very strong once heel exposure exists.
  - Trade-off: heel exposure is harder; opponent can more easily bring pressure forward and more easily heel-slip if exposure is not correct.
- Outside ashi (strategy frame)
  - Built to make outside heel exposure easier.
  - Trade-off: greater requirement to deny back exposure during exposure/finishing.
- Cross ashi (strategy frame)
  - Provides routes to control both of the opponent’s legs and to apply multi-attack trees (Achilles variations, leg laces, etc.).
  - Used as an upgrade when a single-leg entanglement becomes “hard to get a grip on” due to opponent defensive quality.

#### 6.1.2 Non-negotiable finishing requirement: inside + outside heel hooks

- Skill requirement: finish both inside and outside heel hooks.
  - Inside heel hooks are treated as mechanically stronger, but “only inside” is incomplete.
  - If one side is missing, the opponent can steer the exchange into the side you cannot finish.
- Practical implication: exposure + breaking mechanics must exist for both sides, not just “I can get to the position.”

#### 6.1.3 Inside-position battle (primary gate for winning leg-lock exchanges)

- Definition (explicit): keep your feet and knees inside the opponent’s feet and knees.
  - If your feet/knees are inside, you gain access to the opponent’s legs and deny their access to yours.
  - Mixed inside position (each has one foot inside) reduces certainty; the stronger inside-position player dominates exchanges.
- Decision rule:
  - If inside position is lost, do not commit to breaking mechanics; re-win inside position via pummeling/adjustment first.

#### 6.1.4 General escape directions (opponent’s default defensive vectors)

- Expected defensive objectives:
  - Clear the knee line and pull the leg out (extraction).
  - Rotate/roll to change alignment and remove exposure.
  - Drive forward pressure (especially relevant when exposure is weak) to crush the entanglement and/or enable heel slip.
- System response principle:
  - Treat escapes as predictable; build control + continuity to stop them, not “react late” after the leg is already cleared.

#### 6.1.5 Double trouble (two-leg constraint concept)

- Purpose: solve stalemates where single-leg exposure is repeatedly denied.
- Use-case trigger: opponent “locks” defensively and you cannot reliably secure heel exposure on the primary leg.
- Operational idea:
  - Increase constraint by controlling both legs so the opponent cannot freeze a single defensive leg configuration without opening another line.

#### 6.1.6 Continuity tools: following a leg + switching legs

- Following a leg
  - Objective: maintain attachment to the moving target leg through defensive rotation/roll/extraction attempts.
  - Key constraint: do not allow separation between bodies during opponent movement (attachment persists while they try to pull away).
- Switching legs
  - Trigger: primary target leg line becomes difficult to hold (clear/extraction/angle loss).
  - Objective: transfer to the other leg while preserving overall control advantage rather than resetting to neutral.

#### 6.1.7 Foundational drill blocks (what the drills are encoding)

- Basic drills
  - Encode: entanglement entry structure, inside-position awareness, knee-line attachment, and maintaining connection through movement.
- Achilles lock drill
  - Encode: stable straight-foot exposure, bite alignment, and ability to maintain connection while partner resists by pulling away.
- Cowboy drill
  - Encode: maintaining correct leg/hip relationship under resistance so heel slip becomes difficult and finishing alignment stays available.

#### 6.1.8 Submission concept families (what must be true for the break to work)

- Achilles lock concepts
  - Must be applied from a connected structure where the opponent cannot simply pull away and create space.
  - Control + connection are treated as prerequisites to meaningful breaking pressure.
- Knee bar concepts
  - Requires isolating the knee/hip relationship so extension cannot be removed by rotation.
- Toe hold concepts
  - Requires controlling the leg relationship so the opponent cannot freely spin out and remove foot alignment.
- Heel hook concepts
  - Requires reliable heel exposure plus anti-heel-slip structure; breaking mechanics depend on alignment + rotational control.


### 6.2 Volume 2 — Irimi Ashi Garami (structure, stress tests, Achilles engine, heel-slip counters, roll governance, transitions)

#### 6.2.1 Setting irimi ashi (structure before any breaking attempt)

- Objective: build an irimi ashi structure where:
  - the opponent cannot pull themselves away to create separation,
  - the knee line cannot easily clear,
  - your body and their body move as a connected unit during resistance (no “daylight”/gap).
- Connection requirement (explicitly tested later):
  - When the opponent pulls back, you move with them so there is no disconnection.
  - The opponent should “drag you as if you’re one person,” rather than creating separation and extracting.

#### 6.2.2 Stress test (control validation checkpoint)

- Purpose: verify that the ashi structure is tight enough to survive real defense before investing in finishing mechanics.
- Pass/fail cues:
  - Fail: opponent pulls away and you disconnect; knee line clears; you end up chasing late.
  - Pass: opponent pulls and you stay connected; there is no separation between bodies; extraction becomes difficult.

#### 6.2.3 Basic Achilles lock (baseline attack + forcing threat)

- Use as:
  - a legitimate finish when structure is correct,
  - a forcing threat that drives predictable defensive reactions into heel-hook opportunities.
- Key alignment constraint (practical):
  - If the lock is applied while the opponent can pull away and create space, the opponent will eventually pull the foot free.

#### 6.2.4 Countering basic extraction (anti-withdrawal retention)

- Trigger: opponent attempts to straighten/withdraw the leg past your knee line.
- Response goals:
  - stay attached during the withdrawal attempt,
  - close space (remove separation),
  - re-secure the structure before re-applying breaking pressure.

#### 6.2.5 Countering forward pressure with elbow position (anti-crush + anti-heel-slip layer)

- Problem set: opponent comes forward to crush posture and/or initiate heel slip while you are committed to the lock.
- Structural response (explicit cues):
  - Take the elbow in (toward ribs) rather than letting it flare or collapse.
  - Keep hands as high as possible.
  - Keep chin as low as possible.
  - As pressure drives the exchange, start to look belly down rather than remaining flat (directional posture management).
- Failure signal:
  - If hands drop and chin rises, bridging and maintaining breaking alignment become mechanically difficult.

#### 6.2.6 Countering forward pressure with post ashi (wedge creation + stronger break option)

- Trigger: opponent’s forward pressure makes the standard Achilles configuration imperfect/unstable.
- Structural build (explicit mechanics cues):
  - Bring one foot inside and place it on the opponent’s hip.
  - Use the second foot to push down (toward the floor) while raising hips to create a physical wedge.
  - Goal: make it “not easy” for the opponent to drive forward because the wedge blocks the crush.
- Outcome:
  - Post ashi provides a stronger breaking platform once wedge is established.

#### 6.2.7 Countering forward pressure with belly-down Achilles (directional finish choice)

- When pressure/rotation drives the exchange belly down, the finishing direction is treated as acceptable/expected.
- Constraint: structure must remain tight enough that the opponent cannot straighten and pull out past your knee line during the turn.

#### 6.2.8 Switching to butterfly ashi (hub transfer when geometry demands)

- Use-case: opponent’s posture/angle makes standard irimi continuation suboptimal.
- Objective: preserve attachment while changing entanglement geometry so exposure and control return.

#### 6.2.9 Achilles ↔ heel hook dilemma (forcing pair)

- Conceptual engine:
  - Achilles threat forces a defensive movement that exposes the heel.
  - Heel-hook threat forces defense that reopens Achilles pressure.
- Decision rule:
  - When the opponent’s defense meaningfully closes one line, immediately take the paired line (do not persist with the closed line).

#### 6.2.10 Heel slip counter: “high hands” recovery (anti-slip structure)

- Trigger: heel starts slipping as opponent comes forward.
- Key cues (explicit checklist used for maintaining the break under slip pressure):
  - Back heel engagement.
  - Knees pinched together.
  - Opponent’s toes drawn toward their butt.
  - Opponent’s heel aligned toward your chin.
  - Bridge and look over the bottom shoulder.
- Stress-test implication:
  - After establishing high hands + correct ashi, the opponent moving should not create separation; you should remain tight enough to proceed into mechanics.

#### 6.2.11 Heel slip counter: roll-through recovery (“reboot the system”)

- Trigger: opponent comes forward, manages to heel slip, and you do not want to be crushed.
- Response concept: roll through and re-establish a stable entanglement rather than fighting from a collapsing position.
- Explicit mechanics cues included in the roll-through response:
  - Point toes to the ground (foot to floor).
  - Use the roll to transition into a more stable entanglement (including a cross-ashi outcome) or roll the opponent through into a position where you can re-select the finishing route.

#### 6.2.12 Switching to outside ashi (transition to stronger exposure/breaking mechanics)

- Trigger: during transitions, the leg can “sneak out” in a way that favors outside-ashi breaking mechanics.
- Principle:
  - Choose the entanglement that makes your breaking mechanics strongest for the current geometry rather than staying committed to the initial hub.

#### 6.2.13 Single roll theory (roll governance model)

- Purpose: determine how many times and how fast the opponent can roll, and structure the position so the roll resolves into your advantage.
- Core constraint:
  - The directionality of force and your connection determine whether rolling becomes an escape or becomes a controlled transition.
- Explicit structural cues:
  - Create a strong connection of your leg to their leg (remove “daylight”/space).
  - Point knee toward the floor during the roll response (directional control cue).
  - Re-run the stress test logic: if connection is correct, the opponent should not be able to pull free during/after the roll.

#### 6.2.14 Figure-four switch when the opponent refuses to roll (forced reconfiguration)

- Trigger: opponent turns back into you, peels the foot, defends patiently, and does not give the expected roll.
- Execution constraints (explicit):
  - Do not perform the switch slowly; push immediately and pull your knee in.
  - Do not flare the knee in a way that allows full leg extraction.
  - Establish the figure-four configuration.
  - Flare knees and bring hips up; point toes as part of the finishing alignment.
- Additional distinction encoded:
  - Belly-up vs belly-down breaking mechanics differ; the position switch can change which mechanics set applies.

#### 6.2.15 Breaking mechanics (finish layer after exposure/control)

- Principle: breaking mechanics are a distinct layer after structure + exposure are correct.
- Included distinctions:
  - Breaking mechanics differ belly up vs belly down.
  - Slippage becomes more likely (e.g., when sweaty), so anti-slip structure and correct alignment are treated as mandatory.

---

### 6.3 Volume 3 — Outside Ashi (hip control, exposure variants, anti-back-exposure constraint)

#### 6.3.1 Irimi ashi vs outside ashi (selection rule)

- Outside ashi is selected when:
  - outside heel exposure pathways are more available than in irimi,
  - and you can maintain the additional safety constraints required to deny back exposure.

#### 6.3.2 Control while denying back exposure (non-negotiable constraint)

- The outside-ashi game is defined by two simultaneous requirements:
  - expose the heel,
  - deny the opponent’s turn-away lane that creates back exposure.
- Practical evaluation rule:
  - Any exposure pathway that opens an easy turn-away/back-take route is treated as structurally incorrect/incomplete.

#### 6.3.3 Hip control methods (tools used to stabilize exposure)

- Hip control by leg scissoring
  - Used to govern the opponent’s hip line when posture changes and the opponent tries to rotate out.
- Hip control with a cross-shin
  - Used to pin/steer the hips to keep heel exposure stable through opponent movement.

#### 6.3.4 Heel exposure pathways (distinct formats)

- Belly-down heel exposure
- Post-ashi heel exposure
- Post-feet heel exposure
- Cross-shin heel exposure
- Exposure on a kneeling opponent
- Operational implication:
  - Different exposure formats exist because opponent posture/pressure/rotation changes what alignment is available and what must be controlled.

#### 6.3.5 Heel-slip counter with a roll (outside-ashi specific slip response)

- Trigger: heel slip occurs and the opponent uses rotation/roll to remove exposure.
- Response: use a roll-based counter to preserve attachment and re-establish heel exposure rather than losing the leg line.

#### 6.3.6 Finishing Achilles vs defensive roll; heel knee bar add-on

- Defensive roll is treated as expected; finishing lines must account for it rather than being surprised by it.
- Heel knee bar is included as an additional finishing family integrated into outside-ashi endgames.

Section 6 continues with Volumes 4–6 (toe holds/top ushiro; cross-ashi/shoelace; 50/50 + mutual ashi) in the next part.

PATH: INS/gr-satl/bio-gr-satl.md

## 6.0 TECHNIQUE LIBRARY (continued)

### 6.4 Volume 4 — Toe Holds and Top Ushiro (exposure, finishing mechanics, transitions, dilemmas)

#### 6.4.1 Toe hold exposure: belly-down vs belly-up (two exposure orientations)

- Belly-down exposure (orientation choice)
  - Use when opponent posture/rotation makes the belly-down finish vector natural.
  - Exposure requirement: foot alignment must be controlled enough that the opponent cannot simply spin the leg to remove the toe line.
- Belly-up exposure (orientation choice)
  - Use when the leg relationship allows controlled rotation without turning belly-down.
  - Exposure requirement: maintain knee/hip relationship so the opponent cannot retract/clear while you chase the foot.

#### 6.4.2 Toe hold finishing mechanics: belly-down vs belly-up (breaking layer)

- Belly-down finishing mechanics
  - Apply rotational break only after exposure is stabilized (foot alignment + leg relationship).
  - Treat opponent’s ability to spin as the primary counter; finishing must deny free spinning.
- Belly-up finishing mechanics
  - Finish requires controlling the leg relationship so rotation is “taken” through the foot while the knee/hip line is governed.
  - Failure pattern: chasing the foot while the knee line clears or while the opponent rotates freely.

#### 6.4.3 Toe hold → heel hook transition (forcing pair conversion)

- Purpose: toe hold threat is used to force defensive movement that exposes the heel line.
- Transition rule:
  - When toe-hold defense creates heel exposure, convert immediately rather than persisting in a now-neutralized toe hold.
- Use-case: toe hold is not only a finish; it is a control-and-threat tool that changes the opponent’s alignment and defensive priorities.

#### 6.4.4 Recapturing a knee (knee-line re-control during toe-hold sequences)

- Trigger: opponent retracts/clears knee line as you attempt toe-hold exposure or during toe-hold → heel-hook transitions.
- Objective: regain knee-line governance so exposure is not transient.
- Functional meaning: toe hold without knee-line control becomes a foot chase; recapture restores structure.

#### 6.4.5 Calf slice switch (alternate damage/constraint line)

- Trigger: opponent uses defensive alignment/leg locking to deny toe-hold and/or heel-hook lines.
- Purpose:
  - Change defensive priorities by introducing a different break line.
  - Force reactions that reopen toe/heel exposure.
- Constraint: calf slice is treated as a “switch” line—used to redirect defense, not a random add-on.

#### 6.4.6 Top ushiro: introduction + entry (positional frame for combined exposure)

- Top ushiro is introduced as a positional hub that supports:
  - heel-hook exposure,
  - toe-hold exposure,
  - combined threat presentation (the opponent must defend multiple lines).
- Moving to top ushiro
  - Objective: establish a top-control frame over the opponent’s legs where their leg-locking defenses can be dismantled and exposure can be rebuilt.
  - Use-case: when legs are locked or exposure is difficult in lower entanglements, top ushiro functions as an escalation hub.

#### 6.4.7 Exposure from top ushiro (heel hook and toe hold exposure)

- Heel hook and toe hold exposure are presented as co-existing options from the hub.
- Decision rule:
  - If the opponent commits to defending one line (toe or heel), take the other line rather than persisting and stalling.
- Constraint: exposure must be stabilized (foot/heel presented and controlled) before breaking mechanics; top ushiro is a platform for that stabilization.

#### 6.4.8 Double trouble to counter locked legs (stuck-state solver within this volume)

- Trigger: opponent locks legs to deny exposure and freeze the position.
- Use of double trouble here:
  - Control/threaten both legs so the opponent cannot remain locked without opening another line.
  - The goal is not “hold double trouble forever,” but force a reaction that yields a clean exposure line.

#### 6.4.9 Toe hold ↔ knee bar dilemma (forcing pair to reopen finish lanes)

- Purpose: add a second forcing pair when toe-hold-only attacks stall.
- Logic:
  - Defensive alignment that protects toe hold exposes knee bar, and vice versa.
  - Use the opponent’s defense to choose the line rather than selecting blindly.
- Outcome: dilemma prevents the opponent from using a single “lock and wait” defense.

#### 6.4.10 Spinning the leg (mechanical tool for alignment creation)

- Purpose: use controlled leg rotation to:
  - improve exposure quality,
  - create/maintain breaking alignment,
  - prevent the opponent from re-squaring to neutral.
- Constraint: spinning is not “free movement”; it is applied while maintaining knee/hip relationship so the opponent cannot extract.

### 6.5 Volume 5 — Cross Ashi / Shoelace (positions, pummeling, lace/dracula families, dual-heel exposure, continuity)

#### 6.5.1 Cross ashi: leg positions (structure definition)

- Leg positions are treated as the foundation of cross ashi:
  - correct placement determines whether you can attack safely or whether the opponent can rotate/clear.
- Immediate implication:
  - if leg position is wrong, cross ashi creates “issues” (predictable failures) that must be solved before finishing attempts.

#### 6.5.2 Main issues associated with cross ashi (problem set you must solve)

- Cross ashi is framed as having repeatable defensive problems that appear if structure is not upgraded.
- The system response is not “attack harder”; it is:
  - pummel,
  - pass a leg,
  - change leg position so the issue disappears.

#### 6.5.3 Basic theory (what cross ashi is meant to enable)

- Cross ashi is intended to:
  - generate strong control of the opponent’s legs,
  - create access to Achilles threats and heel-hook exposures,
  - provide a platform to move into more constraining variants (lace/dracula families).

#### 6.5.4 Basic leg pummeling (positional improvement engine)

- Pummeling goal:
  - reclaim inside position lanes and upgrade cross-ashi structure.
- Decision rule:
  - if exposure is not available, pummel before forcing.
- Pummeling is treated as an active, repeatable solution to cross ashi issues, not an optional detail.

#### 6.5.5 Figure-4 Achilles (Achilles threat in cross-ashi structure)

- Use as:
  - a stable Achilles threat,
  - a forcing tool to open heel exposure.
- Constraint:
  - success requires cross-ashi structure to prevent easy pull-out/extraction.

#### 6.5.6 Reverse figure-4 Achilles (variant for different alignment/defense)

- Use to adjust pressure/alignment when opponent defense changes.
- Function:
  - keep Achilles threat credible across defensive postures so the Achilles ↔ heel hook engine remains available.

#### 6.5.7 Achilles → heel hook (upgrade line)

- Trigger: opponent defends Achilles in a way that exposes the heel line.
- Rule:
  - convert to heel hook when exposure is created; do not persist with a now-neutralized Achilles.

#### 6.5.8 Leg lace (passing-a-leg upgrade)

- Purpose: pass/lock the opponent’s leg to reduce their defensive rotation and improve exposure reliability.
- Value: lace changes the opponent’s ability to square up or clear knee line, creating a more stable finishing landscape.

#### 6.5.9 Leg lace → heel hook (exposure conversion)

- Lace is used as the control layer; heel hook becomes the breaking layer once exposure is created.
- Constraint:
  - exposure must be stabilized; lace is treated as the tool that stabilizes it.

#### 6.5.10 Passing a leg — 2-on-1 ankle (control upgrade)

- Purpose: isolate and control the ankle/leg to pass the leg across and improve your control geometry.
- Effect:
  - reduces opponent’s ability to rotate/clear, making exposure easier.

#### 6.5.11 Half dracula → heel hook (passing-a-leg variant to exposure)

- Half dracula is treated as a passing-a-leg family move used to:
  - change which heel is available,
  - reduce defensive rotation,
  - open heel exposure.
- Conversion rule:
  - once heel exposure is created, convert to heel hook rather than remaining in the passing step.

#### 6.5.12 Passing a leg — double dracula (stronger passing-a-leg constraint)

- Double dracula escalates the passing-a-leg constraint to further limit opponent movement.
- Purpose:
  - set up exposure of one or both heels with reduced risk of the opponent clearing their legs free.

#### 6.5.13 Exposing both heels (dual-heel escalation)

- Purpose: create a constraint state where the opponent cannot commit to defending only one heel.
- Use-case trigger:
  - single-heel exposure keeps being denied (opponent leg-locking, hiding heel, or rotating).
- Practical effect:
  - forces the opponent to open one side while defending the other, creating a more reliable finishing path.

#### 6.5.14 Countering primary leg escape with stretch ashi (escape-response structure)

- Trigger: opponent uses a primary leg escape pathway to clear a leg line.
- Response: shift to stretch-ashi structure to maintain attachment and prevent full extraction.

#### 6.5.15 Catching the heel without the secondary leg (heel-catch adaptation)

- Problem: secondary leg is not available or opponent defense prevents using it to trap.
- Solution concept:
  - still secure heel exposure by using alternate control mechanics rather than requiring the “ideal” secondary-leg trap.

#### 6.5.16 Catching the heel from shoelace ashi (shoelace-specific exposure)

- Shoelace ashi provides a configuration where heel exposure can be captured.
- Constraint:
  - secure the heel while controlling opponent rotation so the heel does not slip or hide during the catch.

#### 6.5.17 Heisting dilemma from shoelace ashi (forcing pair via movement threat)

- Use-case: opponent defends static exposure lines by stalling or re-squaring.
- Purpose:
  - introduce a heisting threat that forces the opponent to react, opening heel/foot exposure.
- Dilemma logic:
  - defense to the heist opens the exposure line; defense to exposure opens the heist-related continuation.

#### 6.5.18 Using an Achilles to mitigate back exposure (risk-control tool)

- Purpose: apply Achilles threat/structure as a method to reduce back-exposure risk during certain entanglement transitions.
- Logic:
  - Achilles threat changes opponent posture/rotation and can keep them “facing” rather than turning away.

#### 6.5.19 Countering a forced double inversion (anti-escape sequence)

- Trigger: opponent forces a double inversion as an escape/rotation method.
- Objective: prevent the inversion from becoming a clean exit by maintaining attachment and converting to a control structure that survives the rotation.

#### 6.5.20 Achilles grip → backside 50/50 (cross-volume transition hub)

- Transition used to move from Achilles-controlled structure into a backside 50/50 configuration.
- Purpose:
  - use backside 50/50 transitions as a continuation path when cross-ashi lines convert into 50/50 geometry.

#### 6.5.21 “When all fails, center chest” (emergency stabilisation cue)

- Use as an “anti-chaos” principle when the position becomes unstable.
- Functional meaning:
  - re-center your torso/chest relative to the opponent’s hips/leg line to regain connection and prevent the opponent from creating separation and extracting.

#### 6.5.22 Forward shift → heel hook (angle upgrade to exposure)

- Purpose: shift forward to improve heel exposure and enable heel-hook conversion.
- Trigger:
  - opponent defense makes heel exposure partial; forward shift changes alignment to complete exposure.

#### 6.5.23 Far-hip ashi to stop a roll (anti-roll control tool)

- Use-case: opponent initiates a roll to escape.
- Objective: control the far hip line with ashi structure so the roll cannot create separation and clear the leg line.

#### 6.5.24 Transfer to inside ashi (hub transfer to preserve advantage)

- Trigger: cross-ashi geometry becomes less optimal; inside ashi provides stronger control/exposure.
- Objective: transfer while maintaining connection so the opponent cannot extract during the transition.

#### 6.5.25 Following a roll (continuity rule applied to cross-ashi family)

- Maintain attachment through opponent rolling rather than letting the roll become an escape.
- “Follow” is treated as a core continuity rule: re-orient your body/ashi to stay on the target leg line.


### 6.6 Volume 6 — 50/50 and Mutual Ashi (internal gates, dilemma engines, hand-fight solutions, transitions, priority rules)

#### 6.6.1 Intro to 50/50 (hub framing: symmetric entanglement with explicit internal rules)

- 50/50 is treated as a distinct hub with:
  - equal-access danger (both can attack),
  - heavy reliance on internal gates (inside-knee position; separation control),
  - heavy reliance on grip/hand-fight outcomes to determine whether attacks are safe.
- Selection rule (implicit across the system):
  - 50/50 is not “default neutral”; it is entered with a plan (separate, expose, or transition), not to stall.

#### 6.6.2 “Attack until you’re defending” (priority principle)

- Priority framing:
  - In 50/50, the moment you stop solving defensive threats, you become the defender.
  - The hub punishes passive holding; it requires active sequencing to stay ahead of the opponent’s threats.
- Practical implication:
  - Attacks must be chosen to also manage the opponent’s counter-attacks (hand-fight, exposure, separation).

#### 6.6.3 Inside knee position (structural gate for safety and effectiveness)

- Inside-knee position is treated as a key structural requirement within 50/50.
- Functional role:
  - influences how safe your leg is from counters,
  - influences your ability to create separation and exposure.
- Decision rule:
  - if inside-knee positioning is not established, the task is to fix the knee/leg relationship before committing to breaking attempts.

#### 6.6.4 Separating a semi-sankaku (specific internal “stuck” problem)

- Semi-sankaku is treated as a specific entanglement constraint inside 50/50 that limits options.
- Objective:
  - create separation so the toe/heel dilemma engines become available.
- Practical meaning:
  - separation is not cosmetic; it is what turns 50/50 from a stalemate into an attackable structure.

#### 6.6.5 Toe hold ↔ separation dilemma (forcing pair to prevent “safe separation”)

- Threat logic:
  - Toe-hold threat forces reactions that disrupt clean separation or create exposure.
  - Separation attempt forces alignment changes that can expose the toe-hold line.
- Use-case:
  - When opponent attempts to separate as a “safe reset,” the system treats toe-hold threat as the counter that prevents separation being free.

#### 6.6.6 Toe hold ↔ heel hook dilemma (forcing pair inside the 50/50 hub)

- Toe hold threat changes foot alignment and opponent rotation; those defensive changes can expose heel-hook opportunities.
- Heel-hook defense changes alignment in ways that can reopen toe-hold control.
- Decision rule:
  - When defense commits to one line, take the other immediately; do not persist into a stabilized defense.

#### 6.6.7 Countering the hand fight (primary constraint problem in 50/50)

- Hand-fighting is treated as decisive:
  - if you lose grips/hand position, your attacks are delayed and the opponent’s attacks become available.
- Objective:
  - implement grip strategies that protect your own leg while enabling your attacks.
- Practical implication:
  - in 50/50, “attack selection” is constrained by the current hand-fight state; you must solve grips to unlock the break line.

#### 6.6.8 Cross-waist 50/50 (structural variant)

- Cross-waist 50/50 is presented as a specific configuration variant.
- Purpose:
  - change body alignment/connection to improve control, exposure, or safety.
- Use-case:
  - applied when standard 50/50 alignment makes separation/exposure difficult.

#### 6.6.9 Sweep/inversion dilemma vs kneeling opponent (opponent posture-specific forcing)

- When opponent is kneeling, the hub is treated as creating a new dilemma:
  - sweep line vs inversion line (forcing the opponent to concede position or exposure).
- Practical meaning:
  - posture changes create different “best” dilemmas; the system adapts the forcing pair to the posture.

#### 6.6.10 Backside 50/50 transitions (continuity + hub upgrade)

- Backside 50/50 is treated as an upgrade/transition space where:
  - control and exposure lines can change,
  - follow mechanics are used to stay attached as the opponent turns/rolls.
- Purpose:
  - prevent opponent from using rolling to reset; transitions keep you in an advantaged entanglement.

#### 6.6.11 Following a roll (50/50 continuation rule)

- Rolling is treated as expected; 50/50 must include follow mechanics to maintain connection.
- Outcome objective:
  - roll does not end the exchange; it becomes a transition to a better angle/hub.

---

### 6.7 Mutual Ashi (priority rules and exit mechanics)

#### 6.7.1 Intro to mutual ashi (mutual access as a distinct endgame problem)

- Mutual ashi is treated as a special-case hub where both players have access and where “first move” is not automatically advantage.
- The hub requires explicit priority rules to decide when to commit and how to avoid losing on the opponent’s reactive counter.

#### 6.7.2 Going last (priority / sequencing rule)

- “Going last” is treated as a core winning rule in mutual ashi:
  - the player who moves last can capitalize on the opponent’s commitment and end in superior control/exposure.
- Practical implication:
  - do not initiate blindly; induce or anticipate the opponent’s commitment, then use your move to end in advantage.

#### 6.7.3 Rolling through (exit method from mutuality)

- Roll-through is presented as a tool to:
  - escape the mutual stalemate,
  - convert mutual entanglement into a more favorable hub where you can finish.
- Constraint:
  - roll-through is not a disengagement; it is a controlled exit that maintains attachment to the leg line.

#### 6.7.4 Far-hip ashi (control tool within mutual / anti-escape constraint)

- Far-hip ashi is used to:
  - control opponent’s hip line,
  - limit their ability to rotate out or clear,
  - stop roll-based escapes during mutual exchanges.
- Functional meaning:
  - hip control remains the stabilizer even in mutuality; controlling the far hip limits the opponent’s “turn-away” options.

#### 6.7.5 Gripping (endgame detail layer)

- Gripping is treated as a determining factor in mutual ashi outcomes:
  - grip quality determines whether you can secure exposure or whether the opponent can strip and re-square.
- Decision rule:
  - do not commit to the exit/finish without grips that prevent immediate counter-escape.

#### 6.7.6 Outro (integration)

- Closing integration emphasizes:
  - mutual ashi is governed by priority sequencing and controlled exits,
  - follow mechanics and hub transfers are the system’s default way to maintain advantage rather than accepting resets.

+-----------------------------------+

- Entry selection triggers (choose the hub that makes your next 2–3 actions easiest, not the hub you “like”)
  - [IRIMI/INSIDE ASHI]: you can clamp tight connection early and build straight-lock pressure into the Achilles <-> heel-hook forcing pair.
  - [OUTSIDE ASHI]: heel exposure geometry is available, but you must keep back-exposure denial as a live constraint.
  - [CROSS/SHOELACE]: you need pummeling + passing-a-leg upgrades (lace/dracula) to defeat defensive leg locking and create better exposure.
  - [TOE HOLD/TOP USHIRO]: opponent’s leg locking, posture, or alignment makes toe-hold threats or top-ushiro escalation the best forcing route.
  - [50/50]: symmetry is unavoidable or chosen; the hub requires inside-knee gate + hand fight solutions + separation dilemmas.
  - [MUTUAL ASHI]: mutual access exists; priority sequencing (“going last”) governs whether you gain advantage or concede it.
- Inside-position gate (attack permission rule)
  - If inside lanes are not won, “attack attempts” become defensive races; the system response is pummeling and lane recovery.
  - Inside lanes are evaluated dynamically: if the opponent pummels inside during your offense, treat it as an alarm and repair first.
- Control layer (what must be governed before you treat exposure as real)
  - Knee line: opponent cannot freely withdraw past your clamp.
  - Hips: opponent cannot freely rotate to remove exposure or turn away for back exposure.
  - Heel slip: opponent cannot easily strip heel exposure once you have it.
  - Free spinning: opponent cannot spin the foot/leg to neutralize toe-hold and heel exposure lines.
- Threat engine (forcing pair rule)
  - If a threat is defended “well,” the correct action is usually to take the paired line rather than to push harder on the defended line.
- Outcome handling (no reset bias)
  - When defense triggers movement, the default is follow/roll-through/switch legs/transfer hubs rather than accepting a neutral reset.

- Dilemma construction rules (what makes it a dilemma, not two random attacks)
  - Both threats must be credible from the same control platform (or within one transition).
  - The opponent’s “best” defense to one line must predictably produce exposure or alignment for the other line.
- Common defensive triggers that flip the dilemma
  - Achilles pressure triggers: opponent turns/extends/rolls/tries to peel and run.
  - Heel-hook threat triggers: opponent hides heel, changes knee/hip orientation, or tries to clear the knee line.
- Failure patterns (why the dilemma “doesn’t work”)
  - Achilles is applied with poor connection; opponent simply withdraws without meaningful concession.
  - Heel exposure is “touched” but not secured; heel slips immediately and the opponent returns to lane control.
  - Attacker persists on the defended line instead of converting, allowing the defender to settle.
- Corrections (decision rules)
  - If defense reduces pressure but opens heel: convert to heel exposure immediately.
  - If heel is hidden or heel-hook grip is stripped: reassert Achilles bite as the follow threat instead of chasing heel late.

        |
        v
+-----------------------------------------------+
| SAFETY CHECK                                  |
| "Does this exposure open a clear turn-away    |
| lane that gives them a path to my back?"      |
+--------------------------+--------------------+
                           |
                     {OR} yes|no
                         v   v
      +--------------------------------+    +-----------------------------------+
      | CHANGE CONTROL METHOD / ANGLE  |    | PROCEED: exposure -> break layer   |
      | - re-govern hips               |    | - follow roll, deny turn-away      |
      | - change shin/leg control      |    | - keep attachment through movement |
      +--------------------------------+    +-----------------------------------+

- Safety check is continuous, not one-time
  - The risk appears most often during the moment you switch from control to exposure (the opponent turns away as you chase the heel).
- Primary constraint (outside-ashi identity)
  - If your exposure method gives the opponent a clean turn-away lane, treat it as a structural failure, not “bad luck.”
- Typical trigger moments that create back-exposure risk
  - You expose the heel while hips are not governed; opponent rotates away and you lose chest-to-hip relationship.
  - You commit hands to the heel while legs are not controlling rotation; opponent uses that window to turn.
- Correction hierarchy (what changes first)
  - Re-govern the hips (increase hip control) before recommitting to the heel.
  - Adjust your leg structure/shin positioning so the opponent’s rotation is denied.
  - Only then re-enter exposure/finishing mechanics.

                       v
[Re-secure heel + restore alignment] -> (continue break or convert to paired line)

- Heel slip definition (when to treat it as “happening”)
  - Heel is moving out of the control point such that finishing rotation will soon become impossible.
- “High hands” recovery (structure-first)
  - Objective: re-secure heel control by changing hand position higher and tightening the system so forward pressure cannot strip the heel.
  - Live constraints commonly paired with this recovery:
    - knee pinch maintained,
    - heel-to-chin type alignment maintained,
    - posture/bridge alignment maintained so the break line remains available.
- “Roll-through” recovery (movement-first)
  - Objective: use rotation to re-establish a stable entanglement (often a hub transfer) rather than fighting from a collapsing configuration.
  - Use-case triggers:
    - opponent’s forward pressure is crushing the structure,
    - heel slip is progressing and “fixing it in place” is failing.
- Failure patterns (why recoveries fail)
  - Recovery is attempted after full separation occurs (too late).
  - Recovery is attempted without restoring hip/knee-line control, so heel is re-caught briefly then slips again.
- Correction rule
  - The recovery is successful only if it restores a state where the heel cannot immediately slip again under the same defensive action.

     [Force reaction] -> [Return to one-heel exposure] -> (Finish)

- Cross-ashi identity rule
  - Cross ashi is treated as a position with known “issues”; the correct solution is upgrading structure via pummeling and passing-a-leg, not forcing breaks from unstable structure.
- Pummeling triggers (when pummeling is mandatory)
  - Inside lanes are compromised.
  - The opponent can rotate/clear freely.
  - You cannot generate stable exposure without losing attachment.
- Passing-a-leg families (why they exist in the system)
  - They change which heel is exposed and reduce the opponent’s ability to rotate out.
  - They turn “hard-to-catch heel” problems into “the heel must appear” problems by forcing the opponent’s leg relationship to change.
- Dual-heel exposure (why it is an escalation)
  - If the opponent can comfortably defend one heel, exposing both increases constraint and forces them to “choose” a defense that opens a finishing line.
- Failure patterns
  - Trying to finish while cross-ashi issues are unresolved (opponent extracts).
  - Over-committing to heel catch with no knee-line control (heel slip + reset).
- Corrections
  - Treat cross ashi as “upgrade-first”: pummel → pass-a-leg → exposure → finish.

{OR} (Finish) Toe Hold / Heel Hook
     (Transition) Backside 50/50
     (Reset) Re-enter hub with gates repaired

- 50/50 is treated as a “constraint hub,” not a free-attack hub
  - The hub imposes requirements (inside-knee position; grip control; separation work) that must be satisfied before high-confidence breaks.
- Inside-knee gate (why it is first)
  - Without the correct inside-knee relationship, your leg is more exposed to counters and your separation/exposure tools degrade.
- Hand-fight constraint (why it precedes finish attempts)
  - If you lose the hand fight, you lose the ability to secure exposure and you may concede counter-exposure.
- Separation dilemmas (what separation “does” in the system)
  - Separation is not just movement; it creates the geometry that makes toe-hold and heel-hook lines appear reliably.
- Failure patterns
  - Trying to “attack through” a lost hand fight.
  - Ignoring the inside-knee gate and getting countered or stalled.
  - Treating separation as optional and ending in stalemate.
- Corrections (sequencing rule)
  - Fix knee relationship → solve grips → create separation → run the dilemma pair.

     [Transfer to favorable hub] -> (Finish)

- Mutual ashi identity (why it is special)
  - Both players have access; speed alone is unreliable because initiating can expose you to reactive counters.
- “Going last” operational meaning
  - Do not commit first into mutual access unless you have a guaranteed control advantage.
  - Induce or detect their commitment, then use your action to end in superior structure/exposure.
- Roll-through exit (why it exists)
  - Mutuality is treated as a problem to be solved by controlled exit into a favorable hub rather than by trading blind finishes.
- Far-hip ashi control (why it matters in mutuality)
  - Hip control limits the opponent’s ability to rotate away and removes a common escape axis during the transition out of mutuality.
- Failure patterns
  - Initiating first without control advantage and getting countered.
  - Exiting without hip control and allowing the opponent to rotate free.
- Corrections
  - Treat mutual ashi as a priority/timing hub: win the sequence (“last mover”) and exit into a non-mutual finishing platform.


PATH: INS/gr-satl/bio-gr-satl.md

## 8.0 APPLICATION SCENARIOS

### 8.1 Inside-position scramble: both players hunting legs (who gets to attack first)

- Problem shape
  - Both players have partial access; inside lanes are contested (feet/knees pummeling).
  - Attacks initiated without inside position become mutual-attack races rather than controlled offense.
- Primary objective
  - Win inside position (feet + knees inside) before committing to exposure/finishing.
- Decision rules
  - If inside position is lost mid-attack, treat it as an emergency: repair lanes first, then re-apply threat engine.
  - If inside position is mixed (each has one inside lane), treat it as unstable: continue pummeling until you have a clear lane advantage.
- Success indicators
  - You can access their legs while their access to your legs is blocked/delayed by your inside lanes.
- Common failure patterns
  - Chasing a heel/foot while losing lane control, resulting in counter-entry or mutual exposure.
  - Treating “touching the leg” as control while knee line is not governed.

### 8.2 Opponent attempts a basic extraction (pulling the leg out / clearing knee line)

- Problem shape
  - Opponent withdraws the trapped leg; if separation appears, the leg clears.
- Primary objective
  - Maintain attachment (no separation), re-secure knee-line governance, then re-enter the threat engine.
- Immediate priorities
  - Follow the leg during the withdrawal attempt (do not reach late after the leg has cleared).
  - Re-establish the entanglement clamp before applying breaking pressure again.
- Decision rules
  - If your connection breaks (separation appears), treat the finishing attempt as over; rebuild control first.
  - If extraction attempts repeatedly succeed, treat it as a structural problem (failed stress test): rebuild the hub, then retest.
- Failure patterns
  - Continuing to pull on a lock while the opponent is already clearing the knee line.
  - “Foot chasing” after extraction begins instead of maintaining a connected entanglement.

### 8.3 Opponent drives forward pressure into the entanglement (crushing posture + heel-slip pressure)

- Problem shape
  - Forward pressure collapses posture, reduces finishing leverage, and increases the chance of heel slip.
- Primary objective
  - Preserve structure under pressure while keeping the break line available; choose the correct counter-family rather than fighting the crush directly.
- Response families (selection by what pressure is doing)
  - Elbow-position solution (structure-first)
    - Keep elbow position correct (no flaring/collapse) to preserve mechanical advantage under pressure.
    - Keep hands high and chin low to prevent posture collapse from killing the break.
    - If the exchange is driving belly-down, accept the directional finish vector rather than resisting into collapse.
  - Post-ashi wedge solution (wedge-first)
    - Place a foot to the hip and use the other foot to push down while raising hips to form a wedge.
    - Objective: make forward pressure mechanically “expensive” and preserve a stronger break platform.
  - Belly-down Achilles option (directional finish choice)
    - When posture/pressure forces the vector, finish belly down while maintaining knee-line control.
- Failure patterns
  - Letting posture collapse (hands drop; chin rises), then trying to “muscle” the finish.
  - Ignoring the wedge requirement and accepting continuous forward pressure until structure breaks.

### 8.4 Opponent uses defensive rolling as the main escape tool

- Problem shape
  - Opponent rolls to change alignment, strip heel exposure, or clear the knee line.
- Primary objective
  - Convert the roll into continuity: follow the leg, govern the roll outcome, and re-land in control/exposure.
- Core tools (how the system expects you to solve rolls)
  - Single-roll theory (roll governance)
    - Structure the position so the roll resolves predictably (not infinite escape).
    - Maintain tight connection; if connection is correct, rolling does not create separation.
  - Follow-the-leg rule (attachment through rotation)
    - Maintain attachment as the opponent rotates; do not allow the leg to “leave your body.”
  - Switch-legs rule (continuity if target clears)
    - If the primary target leg clears during the roll, transfer to the other leg or transfer hubs rather than resetting.
- Failure patterns
  - Letting the roll create separation, then trying to recover with late grips.
  - Persisting on a defended line through the roll rather than converting to the paired line when exposure changes.

### 8.5 Opponent defends by refusing to roll (stalling, peeling, “patient defense”)

- Problem shape
  - Opponent denies the expected rolling response and instead defends in place, attempting to peel and extract.
- Primary objective
  - Force a reconfiguration that reopens exposure rather than stalling on a defended line.
- System response
  - Execute the figure-four switch as the forced reconfiguration when the opponent refuses to roll.
  - Key constraints: the switch is decisive and structured (not slow), and the knee/hip relationship must not open an extraction window during the switch.
- Failure patterns
  - Switching too slowly and allowing full extraction.
  - Remaining committed to the original line when defense has stabilized.

### 8.6 Heel slip occurs during exposure/finishing (loss of heel control)

- Problem shape
  - Heel begins to slip from control, often paired with forward pressure or rotation.
- Primary objective
  - Recover heel control before it fully escapes; restore alignment so the same defense cannot immediately re-strip the heel.
- Response families
  - High-hands recovery (structure-first)
    - Re-secure heel by adjusting hand position and tightening structure so forward pressure cannot strip the heel.
    - Maintain knee pinch and alignment constraints that keep the heel “loaded” into the breaking line.
  - Roll-through recovery (movement-first)
    - Use a roll-through to rebuild a stable entanglement when forward pressure + heel slip are collapsing the structure.
    - Treat roll-through as a controlled transition to regain a finishing platform, not a disengagement.
- Failure patterns
  - Attempting recovery after full separation has already occurred (too late).
  - Re-catching the heel without restoring knee-line/hip control, resulting in immediate repeat slip.

### 8.7 Outside-ashi exposure attempt creates back-exposure risk (turn-away lane opens)

- Problem shape
  - As you chase heel exposure, the opponent gains a clear turn-away lane that can expose your back.
- Primary objective
  - Deny the turn-away lane first, then re-attempt exposure; never treat back exposure as an acceptable trade for heel exposure.
- Safety rule
  - Any exposure method that gives a clean turn-away lane is structurally incorrect/incomplete and must be changed.
- Practical corrections
  - Re-govern hips (increase hip control) before recommitting to heel exposure.
  - Adjust the control method (e.g., re-establish hip control format) so exposure is created without opening the back.
- Failure patterns
  - Prioritizing heel contact over hip governance.
  - Allowing the opponent to rotate freely during the exposure moment.

### 8.8 Opponent presents a “high leg” defensive problem (harder to enter or exposes different lines)

- Problem shape
  - High-leg positioning changes access routes and can deny the standard entry/exposure path.
- System responses (as framed in the series)
  - Use dedicated counters for the high-leg scenario rather than forcing standard entries.
  - Wrist-to-wrist toe-hold option appears as a named solution in this scenario class (use when alignment presents it).
- Failure patterns
  - Trying to force standard exposure when the leg height/angle denies it.
  - Ignoring the alternate line and burning time into a structurally blocked pathway.

### 8.9 Opponent drops to a kneeling posture (exposure geometry changes)

- Problem shape
  - Kneeling posture changes the exposure pathway and the direction of control required.
- Primary objective
  - Use kneeling-opponent-specific exposure to maintain advantage rather than losing the leg line as posture changes.
- Failure patterns
  - Treating the kneeling opponent like a standing/squared opponent and losing exposure timing.

### 8.10 “Locked legs” / stalemate defense (opponent freezes the position)

- Problem shape
  - Opponent locks legs and uses structure to deny exposure; the exchange stalls.
- Primary objective
  - Apply multi-leg constraint tools and dilemma escalation to force openings; do not wait out the stall.
- System tools
  - Double trouble (two-leg constraint)
    - Control both legs so the opponent cannot freeze one defensive configuration without opening another line.
  - Toe-hold dilemma escalation (toe hold ↔ knee bar) where applicable
    - Use a paired threat to prevent the opponent from defending with one static alignment.
- Failure patterns
  - Persisting in single-heel hunting while the opponent’s locked structure prevents exposure.
  - Treating stalemate as neutral time instead of an active “problem to solve.”

### 8.11 50/50: opponent tries to separate as the “safe exit” (separation dilemma activation)

- Problem shape
  - Opponent attempts to separate and reset from 50/50; symmetry often stalls if separation is unopposed.
- Primary objective
  - Run the toe-hold ↔ separation dilemma so separation is no longer a free defensive choice.
- Sequencing constraints (internal order)
  - Inside-knee position gate first.
  - Hand-fight constraint second (win grips/deny grips).
  - Separation work third (create usable geometry).
  - Then run dilemma pair(s) (toe hold ↔ separation; toe hold ↔ heel hook).
- Failure patterns
  - Attempting to attack without solving hand fight.
  - Attempting to “hold 50/50” without separation mechanics, resulting in stall.

### 8.12 Mutual ashi: both players have access (priority sequencing decides winner)

- Problem shape
  - Mutual access exists; committing first can expose you to reactive counters.
- Primary objective
  - Apply priority rule “going last” and exit mutuality into a favorable hub rather than trading blind finishes.
- System tools
  - Going last (timing rule)
    - Induce or detect opponent commitment, then respond to end in advantage.
  - Rolling through (exit method)
    - Use roll-through as a controlled exit to land in a favorable entanglement rather than staying in mutuality.
  - Far-hip ashi (anti-rotation control)
    - Govern hips during the exit so the opponent cannot rotate free mid-transition.
- Failure patterns
  - Initiating first without control advantage.
  - Exiting mutuality without hip governance, allowing the opponent to clear and reset.
