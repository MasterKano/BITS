TRACEABLE TOKEN NOTES (do not silently rename)

## 2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2.1 What this instructional is doing (high level)
- The instructional connects lower-body leg entanglement defense/offense to upper-body positional gain by converting leg-lock exchanges into backtakes, and when backtakes fail, into guard passes.
- The recurring theme is not “new positions,” but using timing/opportunity and opponent reactions in live resistance to choose when to pursue a backtake versus when to convert into a pass.

2.2 Central conversion principle: lower-body game -> upper-body control (“cranial shift”)
- A repeated emphasis is that successful conversion requires changing from controlling the lower body to controlling the upper body (head/shoulders line), which is framed as the “cranial shift.”
- This is presented as the key bridge between leg entanglements and stable upper-body control (tight waist, chest-to-chest, cross-body ride, side body lock) that enables either back control or passing.

2.3 Back exposure hierarchy: upper vs lower back exposure
- The transcript distinguishes between creating lower-back elevation/exposure versus true upper-back exposure; the point is that exposing the upper back is the reliable route to taking the back.
- The instructional repeatedly frames conversion choices around creating the right type of back exposure rather than simply “lifting hips” or “making them turn.”

2.4 Primary safety/control constraints (what must be solved first)
- “Hiding your foot” is treated as a gating requirement in multiple entanglements (deny heel/foot exposure so you can safely progress).
- “Rule of the Achilles”: the transcript frames Achilles control as a “saving grace” for the defender and as a constraint that can prevent certain step/stand/advance options; the implication is that clearing/denying Achilles control changes what conversions are available.
- “Hips and knees” are repeatedly emphasized as alignment and control priorities (how you orient and wedge the lower body to create turns/exposure while staying safe).

2.5 The instructional’s recurring decision tree (reaction-driven)
- Turn-away reactions: route into exposure methods that chase upper-back exposure (rolling/inverting families show up repeatedly) to finish the backtake.
- Turn-toward reactions: use hips/knees alignment and the cranial shift to prevent square-up and to re-route into back exposure or a pass-first line.
- Turtle / attempted turtle: tight-waist lane becomes the primary anchor for controlling the scramble and finishing the backtake or switching to a tight-waist style pass.
- Posting/framing problems (including “cross lat” / “cross lat post” tokens): the transcript frames this as a clearance battle (elbow/shoulder positioning + top-side shoulder checks) before chest-to-chest or back exposure becomes available.

2.6 System organization by entanglement (how the content is structured)
- Irimi Ashi: foot-hiding baseline -> backtake attempts via roll/inversion families; when the backtake is denied, convert to tight-waist and underhook passing options; includes north-south and “outside camping positions” as recurring destinations.
- Butterfly Ashi: “build to standing” and use Achilles/finish threats to create dilemmas that open passing/backtake lanes; includes underhook-to-backtake and heel-hook-threat-to-backtake concepts.
- Outside Ashi: backstep to cross-body ride, full-roll to side body lock, knee-down theory, elbow vs shoulder battle, top-side shoulder rule, clearing cross lat, and “V-grip and scoot” mechanics; culminates in two named backtake method families (knee-drop method vs rolling method) and a heel-hook-to-backtake/passing dilemma.
- Top Ushiro / “Tapo Shiro”: top-side control lanes feeding underhooks, head-and-arm style lanes, kimura routes, and cross-body ride connections that support pass/back dilemmas.
- Cross Ashi: primary leg extraction and “build to a knee” concepts feed body-lock-to-back; includes backstep/half-roll-to-backstep families, inversion-linked backtakes, and misdirectional backtake/pass exchanges.
- Inside Ashi + the transcript’s “50/50 family” naming (far hip ashi / cross waist ashi / criss cross ashi / backside 50/50): separation/extraction mechanics into passing/backtakes; includes far-leg butterfly-hook-to-backtake and backside entries.

2.7 Failure handling (explicitly emphasized)
- A named recurring problem is losing the back head-and-arm configuration during backtake attempts; the transcript emphasizes immediate head positioning (forehead-to-forehead style cues appear) and re-anchoring upper-body control before re-attacking.
- “Failed backtake -> pass” is not treated as secondary; it is an intended branch where the same exposure/upper-body control work produces guard passing outcomes when hooks/back control are denied.

2.8 Coverage note (what is and is not usable here)
- Volumes 1–6 provide the technical instruction for this BIO.
- Volume 7 transcript content is effectively missing (only a brief fragment is present), so Part 7 rolling footage cannot be transcript-derived here.
- Volume 8 is rolling commentary; it is not treated as primary technical instruction for technical extraction in this BIO.


## 3.0 Volume index

Notes
- No timestamps were provided, so each volume is summarized at the “chapter-heading” level.
- Any transcript-specific tokens are preserved (normalization mappings will be handled later in 13.0 Terminology).

### 3.1 Volume 1 — Foundations + entry to Irimi Ashi
- Sets the overall objective: convert leg entanglement exchanges into back exposure, then either take the back or switch to passing when the back is denied.
- Introduces the core theory pieces that drive the whole system (cranial shift; exposure types; hips/knees priorities; Achilles constraints).
- Starts Irimi Ashi with the safety gate (hide your foot), then compares core backtake families (hip-drop vs inversion) and establishes the “failed backtake → tight waist pass” branch.

### 3.2 Volume 2 — Irimi Ashi conversions and chains
- Builds chaining: backtake attempts should naturally flow into tight waist, underhook passing, north-south, and other top-control outcomes when the back isn’t available.
- Develops the rolling toolkit (forward roll vs inversion; half roll to underhook passing/back access).
- Covers reaction branches (turtle/attempted turtle; turn-away vs turn-toward) and stabilizing positions (“camping positions”) via stepping/backstepping.

### 3.3 Volume 3 — Butterfly Ashi hub
- Uses stand-up/build-up mechanics to finish conversions when grounded exposure stalls.
- Connects Butterfly Ashi to passing/backtake options based on opponent reactions (not one “main” finish).
- Emphasizes underhooks and heel-hook threats as leverage to open the back or force a pass-first route.

### 3.4 Volume 4 — Outside Ashi conversions
- Establishes primary routes (backstep to cross-body ride; full roll to side body lock) with explicit fallbacks (failed ride → guard pass).
- Introduces control checks that decide whether conversion is possible (knee-down theory; elbow vs shoulder battle; top-side shoulder rule; clearing cross-lat frames).
- Consolidates backtake method families (knee-drop method vs rolling method) and frames heel hooks as a dilemma that feeds backtakes/passing.

### 3.5 Volume 5 — Top Ushiro + Cross Ashi integration
- From Top Ushiro: uses underhooks, head-and-arm lanes, and kimura leverage to create a clean back/pass dilemma (not a single linear finish).
- Links top control into cross-body ride and back exposure routes (including from 3/4 mount).
- From Cross Ashi: focuses on primary leg extraction, building to a knee, and connecting to body lock → back, with roll/backstep/inversion options when resisted.

### 3.6 Volume 6 — Inside Ashi + “50/50 family” mechanics
- Uses Inside Ashi transfers (notably into Outside Ashi) and half roll → backstep mechanics to exit stalemates and convert.
- Frames heel hook threats as a tool to force exposure and route into backtakes.
- For the 50/50 family: prioritizes separating legs and extracting to reach body lock/backtakes; includes specific backtake routes (far-leg butterfly hook; backside orientation) and named variations (far hip ashi; cross waist ashi; criss cross ashi).

### 3.7 Volume 7 — Rolling footage (not usable here)
- Intended to be live rolling examples that show the system under resistance.
- The transcript content for this volume is effectively missing, so it cannot be used for transcript-derived extraction in this BIO.

### 3.8 Volume 8 — Rolling commentary (excluded from primary extraction)
- Commentary over the rolling footage; not structured as primary technical instruction.
- Treated as out-of-scope for technical extraction in this BIO (any later extraction must still be strictly transcript-derived).
