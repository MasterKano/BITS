7.0 DIAGRAM SET
  7.1 Master decision tree: leg entanglement → back exposure → finish vs conversion
  7.2 Irimi Ashi conversion map (inversion vs forward-roll branches)

  7.5 Cross Ashi primary leg extraction map
  7.6 50/50 separation/extraction map
8.0 APPLICATION SCENARIOS
  8.1 Opponent turns away: capture + back exposure sequence selection
  8.2 Opponent turns toward you: prevent square-up and re-route to back
  8.3 Opponent turtles: immediate backtake vs pass-first choices

## 1.0 MASTER SYSTEM MAP (ASCII)

ASCII WIDTH RULE (user override): diagrams may be hard-wrapped; max 170 characters/line. Non-diagram prose is not hard-wrapped.

COVERAGE / BOUNDARIES (transcript-derived)
- Vol 1–6: mapped (technical instruction present).
- Vol 7: transcript file is effectively empty; Part 7 rolling footage cannot be mapped.
- Vol 8: rolling commentary; not treated as primary technical instruction for this BIO.

TRACEABLE TOKEN NOTES (do not silently rename)
- katakitame (transcript token; treated as a head-and-arm lane token; appears in Vol 4 transcript)
- tapo shiro (transcript token; appears across Vol 1,4,5,6,8 transcripts)
- top oshiro (transcript token; appears in Vol 5 transcript)
- cross lat / cross lat post (transcript token; appears in Vol 1,4,5 transcripts)
- criss cross ashi / cross waist ashi / far hip ashi (transcript tokens; appear in Vol 6 transcript)
- 50/50 is not a dominant transcript token; the above variants are used instead (map preserves transcript naming)
