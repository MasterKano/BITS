## 2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2.1 What this instructional is doing (high level)
- The instructional connects lower-body leg entanglement defense/offense to upper-body positional gain by converting leg-lock exchanges into backtakes, and when backtakes fail, into guard passes.
- The recurring theme is not “new positions,” but using timing/opportunity and opponent reactions in live resistance to choose when to pursue a backtake versus when to convert into a pass.

2.2 Central conversion principle: lower-body game -> upper-body control (“cranial shift”)
- A repeated emphasis is that successful conversion requires changing from controlling the lower body to controlling the upper body (head/shoulders line), which is framed as the “cranial shift.”
- This is presented as the key bridge between leg entanglements and stable upper-body control (tight waist, chest-to-chest, cross-body ride, side body lock) that enables either back control or passing.

2.3 Back exposure hierarchy: upper vs lower back exposure
- The transcript distinguishes between creating lower-back elevation/exposure versus true upper-back exposure; the point is that exposing the upper back is the reliable route to taking the back.
- The instructional repeatedly frames conversion choices around creating the right type of back exposure rather than simply “lifting hips” or “making them turn.”

2.4 Primary safety/control constraints (what must be solved first)
- “Hiding your foot” is treated as a gating requirement in multiple entanglements (deny heel/foot exposure so you can safely progress).
- “Rule of the Achilles”: the transcript frames Achilles control as a “saving grace” for the defender and as a constraint that can prevent certain step/stand/advance options; the implication is that clearing/denying Achilles control changes what conversions are available.
- “Hips and knees” are repeatedly emphasized as alignment and control priorities (how you orient and wedge the lower body to create turns/exposure while staying safe).

2.5 The instructional’s recurring decision tree (reaction-driven)
- Turn-away reactions: route into exposure methods that chase upper-back exposure (rolling/inverting families show up repeatedly) to finish the backtake.
- Turn-toward reactions: use hips/knees alignment and the cranial shift to prevent square-up and to re-route into back exposure or a pass-first line.
- Turtle / attempted turtle: tight-waist lane becomes the primary anchor for controlling the scramble and finishing the backtake or switching to a tight-waist style pass.
- Posting/framing problems (including “cross lat” / “cross lat post” tokens): the transcript frames this as a clearance battle (elbow/shoulder positioning + top-side shoulder checks) before chest-to-chest or back exposure becomes available.

2.6 System organization by entanglement (how the content is structured)
- Irimi Ashi: foot-hiding baseline -> backtake attempts via roll/inversion families; when the backtake is denied, convert to tight-waist and underhook passing options; includes north-south and “outside camping positions” as recurring destinations.
- Butterfly Ashi: “build to standing” and use Achilles/finish threats to create dilemmas that open passing/backtake lanes; includes underhook-to-backtake and heel-hook-threat-to-backtake concepts.
- Outside Ashi: backstep to cross-body ride, full-roll to side body lock, knee-down theory, elbow vs shoulder battle, top-side shoulder rule, clearing cross lat, and “V-grip and scoot” mechanics; culminates in two named backtake method families (knee-drop method vs rolling method) and a heel-hook-to-backtake/passing dilemma.
- Top Ushiro / “Tapo Shiro”: top-side control lanes feeding underhooks, head-and-arm style lanes, kimura routes, and cross-body ride connections that support pass/back dilemmas.
- Cross Ashi: primary leg extraction and “build to a knee” concepts feed body-lock-to-back; includes backstep/half-roll-to-backstep families, inversion-linked backtakes, and misdirectional backtake/pass exchanges.
- Inside Ashi + the transcript’s “50/50 family” naming (far hip ashi / cross waist ashi / criss cross ashi / backside 50/50): separation/extraction mechanics into passing/backtakes; includes far-leg butterfly-hook-to-backtake and backside entries.

2.7 Failure handling (explicitly emphasized)
- A named recurring problem is losing the back head-and-arm configuration during backtake attempts; the transcript emphasizes immediate head positioning (forehead-to-forehead style cues appear) and re-anchoring upper-body control before re-attacking.
- “Failed backtake -> pass” is not treated as secondary; it is an intended branch where the same exposure/upper-body control work produces guard passing outcomes when hooks/back control are denied.

2.8 Coverage note (what is and is not usable here)
- Volumes 1–6 provide the technical instruction for this BIO.
- Volume 7 transcript content is effectively missing (only a brief fragment is present), so Part 7 rolling footage cannot be transcript-derived here.
- Volume 8 is rolling commentary; it is not treated as primary technical instruction for technical extraction in this BIO.


## 3.0 Volume index

Notes
- No timestamps were provided, so each volume is summarized at the “chapter-heading” level.
- Any transcript-specific tokens are preserved (normalization mappings will be handled later in 13.0 Terminology).

### 3.1 Volume 1 — Foundations + entry to Irimi Ashi
- Sets the overall objective: convert leg entanglement exchanges into back exposure, then either take the back or switch to passing when the back is denied.
- Introduces the core theory pieces that drive the whole system (cranial shift; exposure types; hips/knees priorities; Achilles constraints).
- Starts Irimi Ashi with the safety gate (hide your foot), then compares core backtake families (hip-drop vs inversion) and establishes the “failed backtake → tight waist pass” branch.

### 3.2 Volume 2 — Irimi Ashi conversions and chains
- Builds chaining: backtake attempts should naturally flow into tight waist, underhook passing, north-south, and other top-control outcomes when the back isn’t available.
- Develops the rolling toolkit (forward roll vs inversion; half roll to underhook passing/back access).
- Covers reaction branches (turtle/attempted turtle; turn-away vs turn-toward) and stabilizing positions (“camping positions”) via stepping/backstepping.

### 3.3 Volume 3 — Butterfly Ashi hub
- Uses stand-up/build-up mechanics to finish conversions when grounded exposure stalls.
- Connects Butterfly Ashi to passing/backtake options based on opponent reactions (not one “main” finish).
- Emphasizes underhooks and heel-hook threats as leverage to open the back or force a pass-first route.

### 3.4 Volume 4 — Outside Ashi conversions
- Establishes primary routes (backstep to cross-body ride; full roll to side body lock) with explicit fallbacks (failed ride → guard pass).
- Introduces control checks that decide whether conversion is possible (knee-down theory; elbow vs shoulder battle; top-side shoulder rule; clearing cross-lat frames).
- Consolidates backtake method families (knee-drop method vs rolling method) and frames heel hooks as a dilemma that feeds backtakes/passing.

### 3.5 Volume 5 — Top Ushiro + Cross Ashi integration
- From Top Ushiro: uses underhooks, head-and-arm lanes, and kimura leverage to create a clean back/pass dilemma (not a single linear finish).
- Links top control into cross-body ride and back exposure routes (including from 3/4 mount).
- From Cross Ashi: focuses on primary leg extraction, building to a knee, and connecting to body lock → back, with roll/backstep/inversion options when resisted.

### 3.6 Volume 6 — Inside Ashi + “50/50 family” mechanics
- Uses Inside Ashi transfers (notably into Outside Ashi) and half roll → backstep mechanics to exit stalemates and convert.
- Frames heel hook threats as a tool to force exposure and route into backtakes.
- For the 50/50 family: prioritizes separating legs and extracting to reach body lock/backtakes; includes specific backtake routes (far-leg butterfly hook; backside orientation) and named variations (far hip ashi; cross waist ashi; criss cross ashi).

### 3.7 Volume 7 — Rolling footage (not usable here)
- Intended to be live rolling examples that show the system under resistance.
- The transcript content for this volume is effectively missing, so it cannot be used for transcript-derived extraction in this BIO.

### 3.8 Volume 8 — Rolling commentary (excluded from primary extraction)
- Commentary over the rolling footage; not structured as primary technical instruction.
- Treated as out-of-scope for technical extraction in this BIO (any later extraction must still be strictly transcript-


## 4.0 Core concepts

### 4.1 Leg entanglements as a dilemma engine (backtake vs pass)
- Primary objective: convert lower-body exchanges into upper-body outcomes.
- Build simultaneous threats so the defender cannot cover everything at once.
- Default expectation: leave with a positional upgrade every exchange.
  - Back attaches cleanly → take the back.
  - Back is denied → convert immediately into a pass lane (do not “chase hooks” from a slipping attachment).
- Passing is a designed branch, not a consolation outcome.
- System success metric: reliability of conversion under resistance, not how “dominant” the entanglement looks.

### 4.2 Conversion mindset (win reactions; leave with something)
- Conversion loop:
  - Stay safe in the entanglement.
  - Force a predictable reaction.
  - Select the correct method family (roll/invert/step/come-up).
  - Land in a stable upper-body lane (pin/attachment).
  - Finish as back or pass depending on what the defender gives.
- Opportunistic sequences are valid when failure still yields top control (or another stable lane).
- Do not reset to neutral after an exchange unless forced; always route into a continuation lane.

### 4.3 Cranial shift (lower-body control → upper-body control)
- Definition: shift control priority from legs/hips to head-and-shoulders line.
- Why it matters:
  - “Past the legs” is not the same as “able to finish.”
  - Upper-body control is what stabilizes pins and makes chest-to-back attachment possible.
- Operational cues:
  - Follow the head line; keep your head aligned with theirs as they rotate.
  - When head control is slipping, fix it first before continuing.
  - Transition into upper-body anchors (tight waist, underhooks, head-and-arm circle) as soon as the reaction is created.

### 4.4 Upper vs lower back exposure (what “counts” as back access)
- Lower-back exposure ≠ completion.
- Completion state:
  - Chest-to-upper-back connection.
  - Centre lines aligned.
- Exposure must be paired with an upper-body connection; exposure without connection is transient.
- Upper-body connection must be no-gi functional (cannot rely on belt-style pulling).
- If upper-back exposure cannot be maintained, route into pin/passing lanes rather than forcing back attachment.

### 4.5 Hips-and-knees alignment (containment rules and diagnostics)
- Containment rule:
  - Hips inside your knees → back is available.
  - Hips outside your knees → back connection is degrading.
- Continuous diagnostic during rolls/inversions/build-ups:
  - If containment is lost, expect hook insertion to fail; switch branch.
- Directional control objective:
  - Point the opponent’s knees away from you → pass/back becomes available.
- Maintain structural integrity while transitioning (do not separate controls while “climbing” to the upper body).

### 4.6 Rule of the Achilles (constraint that governs what is possible)
- Achilles control is a major limiter on conversion freedom.
- If the opponent maintains meaningful Achilles control:
  - Back-chasing routes become low percentage.
  - Forward-pressure upgrades are constrained.
- If Achilles control is absent/cleared:
  - Angle changes, come-ups, and back-chasing routes open up.
- Treat Achilles control as a gating check before committing to certain branches (especially pressure-forward advancements).

### 4.7 Knee-down theory (mode shift to forward pressure)
- Knee-down is a functional control upgrade (not “knee touching the mat”).
- Functional prerequisites:
  - Separate the opponent’s legs.
  - Create posture that supports forward pressure (heel-to-butt cue).
- Outside-ashi contexts support knee-down pressure-forward advancement more readily than irimi contexts.
- Achilles control blocks effective knee-down pressure-forward work (dependency link to 4.6).

### 4.8 Elbow vs shoulder battle (inside-position gate)
- Problem state:
  - Opponent keeps elbow inside your shoulder line and keeps the hand inside → you cannot come forward effectively.
- Target state:
  - Your shoulder inside their elbow line (win inside shoulder position).
- Method concept:
  - Push/force the elbow across to reverse the relationship.
- Why it matters:
  - Winning this gate unlocks either chest-to-chest pins (pass) or chest-to-back routes (back), depending on shoulder-line availability.

### 4.9 Top-side shoulder rule (chest-to-back vs chest-to-chest filter)
- Decision filter:
  - Top-side shoulder in front of the bottom-shoulder line → chest-to-back route.
  - Top-side shoulder behind that line → chest-to-chest pins and pass-first route.
- The rule is applied through a stable “coming forward” base (post foot/hand structures).
- Frames/posts commonly interfere; clear them, then re-check the shoulder relationship before committing.

### 4.10 Reaction-led branching (turn away / turn toward / turtle / frames)
- Primary reaction categories that drive branch selection:
  - Turn away → upper-back exposure and chest-to-back attachment routes.
  - Turn toward → accept chest-to-chest pins and pass-first control, or re-route to regain exposure.
  - Turtle / attempted turtle → tight-waist capture as the anchor; finish as back or pass.
  - Post/frame → clearance step required before pressure/attachment.
- Treat method families as tools chosen by reaction, not fixed scripts.

### 4.11 Hip square vs hip stagger (method selection cue)
- Hip orientation cue for selecting method family:
  - Hips square → forward-roll style routes are favored.
  - Hips staggered/angled → hip-based “fall to hip / hipdrop” style routes are favored.
- Use this as a quick selector when deciding between roll families under resistance.

### 4.12 Knee–elbow connection (anti-recovery structure; timing windows)
- Maintain knee–elbow connection as a default structural rule during transitions.
- Purpose:
  - Prevent re-insertion of legs/feet and recovery of inside position.
  - Deny space that enables re-guarding and re-squaring.
- Timing window:
  - Opponent must separate knee–elbow to move/build/escape; attack during that separation.

### 4.13 Cross-lat / cross-shoulder post (primary frame problem + clearance requirement)
- Common defensive barrier: cross-lat / cross-shoulder post blocks forward pressure and denies shoulder-line advantages.
- Operational rule:
  - Clear the post/frame before expecting shoulder-rule execution or consistent forward-pressure progress.
- Clearance concept:
  - Track the posting structure, break its function, flatten/redirect posture, then proceed.

### 4.14 Wedges (anti-explosive control during build-ups and angle changes)
- Wedges are structural blocks that remove explosive options while you build height or change angle.
- Purpose:
  - Prevent sudden run-outs/rotations as you come up.
  - Stabilize the moment you transition from lower-body control to upper-body control.
- Use wedges as “control-before-movement” mechanics in build-up phases.

### 4.15 Come-up milestones (build to standing / build to a knee as conversion finishers)
- Come-up milestones are treated as conversion finishers when grounded exposure stalls:
  - Build to a knee.
  - Build to standing.
- Why they matter:
  - Upgrades the exchange from entanglement-only to top-control-ready.
  - Makes pass lanes (tight waist, underhooks, north-south, body-lock routes) more stable.
- Come-up requires structural safety:
  - Foot safety and Achilles constraint awareness.
  - Knee–elbow connection and wedges to prevent reversals.

### 4.16 No-gi connection replacements (trap grip / cross-trap grip; pulling vs pushing)
- Replace belt-style pulling with no-gi connection solutions that maintain upper-back exposure.
- Trap grip / cross-trap grip as named connection families.
- Functional distinction:
  - Some connections excel at pulling/keeping the upper back connected.
  - Some connections are weaker for pushing/flattening; switch connections as posture/shoulders change.
- Connection choice determines whether you can maintain chest-to-upper-back long enough to complete the back take or must route into chest-to-chest pins and pass.


## 5.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Scope note (transcript-derived)
- This BIO’s technical systems are driven by Volumes 1–6. Volume 7 transcript content is effectively missing. Volume 8 is rolling commentary and is not treated as primary technical instruction for system extraction.

### 5.1 Irimi Ashi (entries, defensive goals, conversion targets)
- System purpose
  - Use Irimi Ashi exchanges as a controlled environment to force predictable turns and expose the back.
  - When back attachment is denied, convert immediately to top control and passing (rather than resetting or forcing hooks).
- Gating constraints (what must be true before “chasing” outcomes)
  - Foot safety: “hiding your foot” is treated as a prerequisite for attempting extended conversions.
  - Achilles constraint: the “rule of the Achilles” is treated as a major limiter on what conversions are realistically available while the opponent has strong Achilles control.
  - Lower-body alignment: maintain hips/knees alignment while you transition toward upper-body control (otherwise you lose the backtake connection).
- Primary conversion families (how Irimi produces back/pass)
  - Backtake families framed in the content:
    - Hipdrop-style back takes versus inversion-based back takes (explicit comparison).
    - Forward-roll back takes versus inversion (explicit comparison).
    - Half-roll sequences that route into underhook passing/back access.
  - Top-control conversion lanes repeatedly linked to Irimi outcomes:
    - Tight waist as a stabilizing anchor (including as the default branch after failed backtakes).
    - Underhook passing as a pass-first branch that retains backtake follow-ups.
    - North-south as a forward-step reroute when direct back attachment is blocked.
- Reaction branches (the “decision tree” Irimi is expected to run)
  - Opponent turtles or attempts turtle: tight-waist style capture becomes the anchor for back/pass.
  - Opponent turns away vs turns toward: backtake selection and pass-first selection are framed as reaction-driven choices rather than fixed sequences.
- “Camping” integration
  - Irimi includes stepping/backstepping routes into “outside camping positions” and “backstepping to camping positions” as stabilizing top states to continue the pass/back dilemma.

### 5.2 Butterfly Ashi (standing builds, offense-to-conversion framing)
- System purpose
  - Use Butterfly Ashi as a hub that naturally opens either passing or backtaking opportunities based on reactions.
  - Use stand-up/build-up mechanics to finish conversions when grounded exposure stalls.
- Key conversion levers emphasized in the material
  - Underhook acquisition as a bridge from lower-body entanglement advantage to upper-body control and back access.
  - Heel hook threat used to force reactions that open backtakes (and/or passing), consistent with the broader dilemma model.
- System outputs
  - Passing and backtake options are presented as paired outcomes (not separate “chapters” of unrelated techniques).
  - “Intro to Irimi Ashi offense” appears here as an inter-system link: Butterfly sequences are presented as able to feed into Irimi-style offensive branches when the opponent’s reactions and leg positioning present it.

### 5.3 Outside Ashi (cross-body ride and back exposure pathways)
- System purpose
  - Use Outside Ashi to upgrade into heavier forward pressure, stabilize through frames, and convert into either back takes or guard passes with high repeatability.
- Core control upgrades emphasized
  - Knee-down theory as a key control upgrade that enables forward pressure and passing/back lanes (treated as a meaningful “mode shift,” not a cosmetic detail).
  - The elbow vs shoulder battle as an inside-position gate for coming forward effectively.
  - The top-side shoulder rule as a positional decision filter for choosing chest-to-back versus chest-to-chest outcomes.
  - “Clearing a cross lat” as a repeated frame-clearing problem that must be solved to apply the above.
- Primary conversion lanes named in the content
  - Backstep to cross body ride as a major route; with an explicit failure branch:
    - Failed cross body ride is routed to guard passing rather than abandoning the exchange.
  - Full roll to side body lock as another stabilization route feeding back/pass.
  - Chest-to-chest passing as a core route that is explicitly linked to backtakes (passing pressure and back exposure are treated as connected).
- Backtake method families consolidated in this system
  - Backtakes from inversion as a repeated family.
  - “V grip and scoot” as a named movement/grip idea that feeds roll-based exposure.
  - Half-roll/full-roll to back as a roll-depth family, tied to achieving the correct exposure and connection.
  - Two explicitly named completion families:
    - Knee-drop method for taking the back.
    - Rolling method for taking the back.
- System outputs
  - Back takes and guard passes are treated as paired outcomes, including explicit “heel hooks to backtakes/passing” dilemma framing.
- Inter-system links present in the material
  - Outside Ashi is explicitly tied into top-side “ushiro/oshiro” style sequences via “clearing the knee from top ushiro” and “V grip from top oshiro transition.”

### 5.4 Top Ushiro (top-side control, passing/backtake integration)
- Token alignment (traceability)
  - Chapter heading uses “Top Ushiro.” Transcript tokens appearing around this content include “tapo shiro,” “toposhiro,” and “top oshiro.” (Normalization mapping belongs in 13.0, but the system is treated here as one cluster.)
- System purpose
  - Provide a top-side upper-body control framework that reliably produces either:
    - Back takes, when the opponent’s reaction opens attachment, or
    - Guard passes, when the opponent blocks back attachment and accepts pins.
- Primary levers and lanes as organized in the content
  - Underhook to guard pass / back take as a central fork.
  - Back head-and-arm lanes explicitly tied to both backtakes and guard passes.
  - Kimura leverage used as a route to either:
    - Rotate into back exposure (kimura to back), or
    - Force and stabilize passing outcomes (kimura to guard pass).
  - 3/4 mount to cross body ride as a top-control connection that feeds back exposure and/or passing stability.
- Inter-system role
  - Serves as a return point from Cross Ashi sequences (“moving back to top ushiro”) when the exchange stabilizes into top control rather than continuing as a pure leg entanglement fight.

### 5.5 Cross Ashi (leg extraction framework into body lock/back)
- System purpose
  - Use Cross Ashi to extract the primary leg, come up to top control, and convert into body-lock-to-back or pass/back dilemmas.
- Gating constraints and recurring problems called out
  - Foot safety: “hiding your foot” appears as a repeated prerequisite before attempting extended extraction/conversion.
  - “Beating a cross lat post” is treated as a common resistance problem in the come-up/extraction phase.
- Primary conversion lanes emphasized
  - Primary leg extraction → build to a knee → body lock → back as the main “spine” of the system.
  - Backstep options immediately after extraction as stabilization and/or angle-change into other top-control lanes.
  - Roll to cross body ride as a route when the direct come-up/back line is resisted.
  - Backtakes from inversion and half-roll to backstep as recurring method families to keep access when the opponent’s reactions block the first line.
  - Misdirectional backtakes/passes as a concept for exploiting defensive anticipation (keeping the dilemma alive).
  - Explicit return link: moving back to Top Ushiro when the leg exchange resolves into top-side control.
- System outputs
  - Body lock to back is treated as a reliable terminal outcome.
  - Heel hook to back appears as a dilemma branch: the finish threat is used to force reactions that open back conversion rather than committing only to the finish.

### 5.6 Inside Ashi (transfer logic; heel hook to back)
- System purpose
  - Use Inside Ashi as an entanglement that often resolves by transferring to Outside Ashi or by using roll/backstep families to reach upper-body control lanes.
- Key pathways emphasized in the content
  - Transfer to Outside Ashi as an explicit inter-system solution (Inside Ashi is not treated as isolated; it feeds Outside Ashi control upgrades).
  - Half-roll to backstep as a repeated exit/angle-change family.
  - Heel hook to back as a dilemma branch: finish threat used to open back conversion.

### 5.7 50/50 (separation, extraction, and backtake lanes)
- Token alignment (traceability)
  - The transcript does not lean on the literal “50/50” token as strongly as the chapter headings; it uses specific variants including “far hip ashi,” “cross waist ashi,” “criss cross ashi,” and “backside 50/50.”
- System purpose
  - Treat the position as a separation/extraction problem first: separate legs, then convert into passing/backtakes and body-lock access rather than stalling in symmetrical entanglement.
- Core priorities emphasized
  - Half-roll to back step and stand-up/build-to-standing appear as main ways to resolve stalemates and create angle.
  - Separating legs is treated as the gateway to clean passing/backtake work.
  - Extraction to body lock/backtakes is treated as a primary conversion.
- Specific backtake lanes named
  - Far leg butterfly hook to back take as a named route.
  - Backside 50/50 to backtake as a named orientation-based route.
  - Variant naming (far hip ashi / cross waist ashi / criss cross ashi) is treated as a family of related shapes feeding the same separation/extraction → pass/back outcomes.

### 5.8 “Camping positions” (where they appear and why)
- System purpose
  - “Camping” is presented as a stabilization layer: reach a position where the opponent is constrained to predictable, limited rotation (often described as “half rotation”), then run the pass/back dilemma from a secure base.
- Where it appears
  - Explicitly in Irimi Ashi conversion material (outside camping positions; forward-step and backstep entries).
  - Reappears as a repeated destination in broader stepping/backstepping sequences that aim to stabilize after the opponent’s turn reactions.
- Operational role
  - It is not presented as an endpoint; it is presented as a platform that:
    - makes passing predictable when the opponent tries to re-guard, and
    - makes backtakes available when the opponent turns away/explodes out of pins.

### 5.9 Back exposure methods (knee-drop vs rolling, inversion vs forward-roll)
- The content organizes “methods” as families selected by reaction and alignment rather than as one fixed sequence:
  - Hipdrop backtake family versus inversion family (explicit comparison within Irimi material).
  - Forward-roll family versus inversion family (explicit comparison within Irimi conversion material).
  - Half-roll family (appears as a bridge into underhook passing/back access; also appears in Cross/Inside/50-50 family exits).
  - Full-roll family (used to reach stabilizing top-control states such as side body lock and to complete exposure when alignment is correct).
  - Knee-drop family (explicitly named as a backtake method in Outside Ashi material; linked to knee-down theory and forward pressure prerequisites).
  - Rolling method family (explicitly named as a backtake method; paired with knee-drop method as the other primary completion family in Outside Ashi).
  - Stand-up/build-to-standing family (appears in Irimi/Butterfly/50-50 family as a finishing mechanic when grounded conversion stalls).
  - Step families that redirect exposure into top-control lanes:
    - Forward step to north-south.
    - Backstep to cross body ride.
    - Step/backstep into camping positions.
- Across families, two repeated requirements are emphasized:
  - Exposure must become upper-back exposure with a usable upper-body connection (the cranial shift).
  - Lower-body alignment must be maintained (hips/knees control) so the opponent cannot drift out of your structure while you climb to attachment or pin.


## 6.0 Technique library (expanded; main techniques and branches)

### PART 1 of 2 (6.1–6.4)

### 6.1 Part 1 — Foundations

#### 6.1.1 Intro
- Primary objective: use lower-body attacks/defense to create upper-body positional gains (back takes and guard passes).
- Core model: attempt back takes off leg exchanges; when back takes fail, flow directly into guard passes; when guard passes are resisted by turning away, flow back into back takes.
- Key emphasis: timing and opportunity against resisting opponents (not “new moves only”).

#### 6.1.2 Overview
- Default workflow:
  - Establish leg-control scenario → force a defensive reaction → convert to upper-body control → finish as back take or guard pass.
- Decision drivers repeated throughout:
  - Where the head goes (head slipping out vs controlled).
  - Whether hips stay contained relative to your knees.
  - Whether Achilles control is present (gates what you can realistically force).
- “Leave with something” principle:
  - If a back take attempt doesn’t attach, do not reset; route immediately into a stable top-control lane (tight waist / underhook passing / north-south / camping / ride styles).

#### 6.1.3 Theory
- Dilemma logic: the more threats you present at once, the harder it is to defend.
- Conversion is the skill:
  - You are not “finishing leglocks”; you are forcing reactions that let you either attach chest-to-back or pin chest-to-chest.
- Opportunistic attempts are acceptable if failure lands you in a strong top-control/passing lane (low downside, high positional upside).

#### 6.1.4 Cranial shift (mechanical implementation)
- Named bridge: shift from leg focus to head/shoulder-line focus to complete conversions.
- “Head slipping out” is treated as a hard stop:
  - If the head starts moving out/away during the come-up, address it immediately (close the head-line) before continuing.
- Upper-body connection replaces belt-pulling:
  - Use trap-grip / cross-trap style connections to pull the upper back into your chest and keep centre lines aligned.
- Key cue repeated: trap grip is strong for pulling/connecting; it is weaker for pushing/flattening, so connection choice changes as posture changes.

#### 6.1.5 Upper vs lower back exposure (completion standard)
- Completion state for “back access”:
  - Chest connected to upper back + centre line aligned.
- Lower-back rotation alone is not treated as completion.
- Exposure must be paired with a usable upper-body connection; otherwise the opponent will re-square and you must switch to pin/passing.

#### 6.1.6 Hips and knees (containment + attachment reliability)
- Diagnostic rule used during attachment:
  - If the hips drift outside your knees, the back connection degrades.
- Control requirement during transitions:
  - Maintain containment while you “climb” to upper-body attachment; do not trade hip containment for a loose reach.

#### 6.1.7 Rule of the Achilles (gate)
- Achilles control is treated as a primary constraint on conversions.
- If Achilles control is strong:
  - back-chasing becomes low percentage,
  - forward-pressure upgrades are blocked,
  - you prioritize clearing/denying the control or switching branches.

---

### 6.2 Intro to Irimi Ashi

#### 6.2.1 Hide your foot (baseline safety)
- Foot-hiding mechanics emphasized:
  - Outside blade of the foot on the floor.
  - Toes pointed to reduce exposure.
  - The closer your foot is to the opponent’s body, the easier it is for them to attack; foot-hiding reduces that.
- Dilemma framing: heel-hook exposure vs Achilles control risks must be managed before you try to convert.

#### 6.2.2 Basic recap (working shape and priorities)
- Stabilize the irimi structure first; do not “move on” if foot safety is not solved.
- Maintain lower-body alignment while preparing to convert up to upper-body control (do not free your hips without an upper-body plan).

#### 6.2.3 Back take families: “fall-to-hip” connection vs full inversion
- Common starting cluster (when opponent “loses the leg” and tries to recover):
  - V-grip on the ankle.
  - Knee between the opponent’s legs to pin and prevent re-insertion.
  - Pin the ankles as you set the transition.
- Knee–elbow connection is treated as critical during this phase:
  - If knee and elbow separate, the opponent can bring a foot back inside (bad), so you keep knee–elbow connected while you move.
- Two back take types are taught from this pinned-ankle scenario:
  - A “fall-to-hip” type where you connect hip + trap (or cross-trap) and pull the upper back into your chest as you drop.
  - A “full inversion” type where ankles are pinned before the opponent can fully invert, then you rotate through while controlling hip and building the upper-body connection.

#### 6.2.4 Failed back take → tight waist guard pass (designed failure branch)
- When attachment does not secure:
  - Immediately switch to tight waist as the stabilizing anchor.
- Tight waist + build-up mechanics:
  - Secure tight waist (shallow or deep).
  - Build to elbow and then build height.
  - Maintain knee–elbow connection during the rise; if knee and elbow separate, the opponent can bring the knee through the space.
- Reinforcement structure options shown:
  - Standard knee–elbow connection as you rise.
  - A “shelf” style knee–elbow connection (knee shelved to the far hip) that blocks the opponent’s shrimp and prevents space creation as you post and come up.

---

### 6.3 Part 2 — Irimi Ashi conversions / passing–backtake chains

#### 6.3.1 Losing a back head-and-arm (head-line recovery)
- Problem cue: as you come up, the opponent’s head starts to slip outside and away.
- Immediate response cue:
  - Forehead to forehead as the first priority (stop the head from walking out).
- Reasoning expressed:
  - The only way the opponent frees the head is by creating an angle (walking the head out); you stop the angle by closing head-to-head contact early (before you’re fully on your knees).
- Secondary structure layered in:
  - Knee and elbow positioning while rising is treated as part of preventing the opponent from rebuilding their structure as their head clears.

#### 6.3.2 Backtake / guard pass combinations (paired outcomes)
- If the opponent accepts chest-to-chest to deny the back:
  - You keep the pin and pass.
- If the opponent turns away to flee the pin:
  - You follow and re-open back attachment.
- The techniques are presented as chained outcomes (do not treat “backtake attempt” and “pass attempt” as separate sequences).

#### 6.3.3 Forward roll back takes vs inversions (risk + reward framing)
- Forward roll family is presented as higher commitment:
  - If it fails, you can end in bottom position (risk).
- Inversion family is presented as a safer chase when forward roll doesn’t deliver the correct exposure/connection (lower risk of fully losing top position).
- Selection logic emphasized:
  - Choose the method family that preserves top position and keeps the conversion alive, even if upper-back exposure is less perfect in the moment.

#### 6.3.4 Half roll → underhook passing / back take
- Half roll is used as an “angle change that keeps you on top” to land in an underhook lane.
- Underhook lane is treated as a fork:
  - If they turn toward to deny hooks → chest-to-chest pin and pass.
  - If they turn away to escape pin → chest-to-back routes open.

#### 6.3.5 Build to standing (conversion finisher)
- Build to standing appears as a finisher when grounded attachment stalls.
- Structural rule during build:
  - Maintain containment and deny the opponent the space to insert a knee/foot as you rise.

#### 6.3.6 Forward step → north-south (positional reroute)
- Forward step is used to redirect the exchange when the direct attachment line is blocked.
- North-south is treated as a stable top pin that maintains passing pressure while still allowing back follow-ups if the opponent turns away.

#### 6.3.7 Backtake when opponent turtles (turtle trigger)
- Turtle/attempted turtle is treated as a trigger for immediate upper-body anchoring (tight waist style capture).
- Back completion is attempted when the angle/attachment appears; otherwise, the anchor is used to flatten and pass.

#### 6.3.8 Back take / passing from an attempted turtle (capture the transition)
- Attempted turtle is treated as a window:
  - capture before they fully set turtle structure.
- If you miss hooks/attachment:
  - prioritize flattening and passing off the capture rather than hovering behind a stable turtle.

#### 6.3.9 Forward step → outside camping positions (stabilize rotation)
- “Camping” is used to limit rotation and prevent full recoveries.
- From camping:
  - If they accept pins → pass-first.
  - If they try to run/turn away → back opens.

#### 6.3.10 Turning away: take the back (attachment priorities)
- Turning away is treated as the reaction that creates the cleanest back access.
- Key priorities repeated:
  - keep head high with theirs during the chase,
  - maintain hip containment (do not let hips drift outside your knees),
  - insert hooks only after chest-to-upper-back connection is secured.

#### 6.3.11 Turning toward: pin and pass (deny hook chase)
- Turning toward is treated as a common defense to deny hooks.
- Response:
  - accept chest-to-chest pinning and run passing, expecting later turning reactions to re-open the back.

#### 6.3.12 Passing off failed back takes (no reset rule)
- Failure response is structured:
  - tight waist passing,
  - underhook passing,
  - north-south reroute,
  - camping stabilization,
  - cross-body ride style stabilizations when available.

#### 6.3.13 Backstepping to camping positions (angle-change stabilization)
- Backstep is used as a repeatable way to land in a stable “camping” alignment.
- Camping is treated as continuation platform (pass/back dilemma), not a terminal position.

### 6.4 Part 3 — Butterfly Ashi

#### 6.4.1 Intro to Butterfly Ashi (defense-to-conversion frame)
- Butterfly ashi is treated as a hub where you:
  - stabilize leg safety first (prevent heel exposure),
  - then convert to top pressure and upper-body control lanes.
- “Switch to outside ashi” appears as a safety answer when heel/toe threats are present and the configuration makes them hard to manage directly.

#### 6.4.2 Build to standing (safety + finish)
- Standing build is used to complete conversions when grounded attachment/pinning stalls.
- Structural emphasis:
  - deny heel exposure as you heist/stand,
  - rise in a way that keeps your opponent from creating angles to expose your heel.

#### 6.4.3 Passing and backtake options (paired outcomes)
- From the come-up:
  - worst case scenario highlighted: the opponent can lock half guard and you end chest-to-chest half guard, which is treated as acceptable because you are ready to pass.
- The general rule is to accept the pin when it appears rather than forcing back attachment through strong frames.

#### 6.4.4 Underhooks to backtake (head + underhook integration)
- Underhook is treated as a key bridge to upper-body control.
- Head position is treated as a safety and steering factor:
  - if head is not placed correctly, the opponent can turn toward you,
  - if head is placed correctly, exploding toward you is hard; exploding away opens re-attachment opportunities.
- If the opponent creates space while you pursue the underhook lane:
  - reroute to north-south and maintain a top pin rather than losing position.

#### 6.4.5 Heel hook threat → back/pin conversion
- Heel hook is used as a lever to force defensive reactions.
- The conversion is framed as:
  - force the reaction (pull away / hand-fight / posture change),
  - switch to upper-body attachment (chest-to-back) when the reaction opens it,
  - or accept top pin/passing if the reaction blocks back attachment.
- Two-on-one control appears as a repeated hand-control solution during the reaction phase before chest-to-back attachment.


## 6.0 Technique library (expanded; main techniques and branches)

### PART 2 of 2 (6.5–6.9)

### 6.5 Part 4 — Outside Ashi (conversion hub)

#### 6.5.1 Back step → cross body ride
- Primary entry idea: use the backstep to change the line of control and land in a ride that controls rotation.
- Ride objective: trap rotation so the opponent cannot freely square hips or re-guard; use the ride to open either:
  - chest-to-back access when they turn away, or
  - chest-to-chest pressure when they turn toward to deny hooks.

#### 6.5.2 Failed cross body ride → guard pass
- Explicit branch: if the ride does not “stick,” convert directly into a pass rather than re-entering a loose leg exchange.
- Conceptual rule: do not accept a prolonged scramble when you can stabilize as top passer.

#### 6.5.3 Full roll → side body lock
- Full roll used as a completion family when the opponent’s rotation/frames make the ride entry unstable.
- Side body lock treated as a stabilization platform:
  - if they accept the pin, pressure pass;
  - if they turn away to escape, back access opens.

#### 6.5.4 Knee-down theory (functional knee-down, not cosmetic)
- Purpose: shift from entanglement control to forward-pressure control.
- Functional prerequisites emphasized:
  - Separate the opponent’s legs (no separation → you cannot come forward effectively).
  - Sprawl/crawl legs back to achieve a stable base.
  - Achieve the “heel to butt” capacity (indicator you can drive forward rather than hang back).
- Dependency: Achilles control blocks functional knee-down because it prevents the posture and pressure required.

#### 6.5.5 Elbow vs shoulder battle (inside-position gate)
- Problem: if the opponent’s elbow is inside your shoulder line and their hand is inside, you cannot pressure forward.
- Objective: push the elbow across and win “shoulder inside elbow.”
- After you win:
  - you can come forward into chest-to-chest pins,
  - or, if shoulder-line conditions allow, transition into chest-to-back.

#### 6.5.6 Top side shoulder rule (branch selector)
- Decision filter:
  - top-side shoulder in front of the bottom-shoulder line → chest-to-back.
  - top-side shoulder behind that line → chest-to-chest and pass-first.
- Application note: treat this as a repeated check while clearing frames, not a one-time decision.

#### 6.5.7 Clearing a cross lat (frame removal problem)
- Cross-lat / cross-shoulder post is treated as a primary defensive barrier to forward pressure and shoulder-line advantage.
- Operational rule: clear/defeat the post, then re-apply elbow/shoulder and shoulder-line decisions.
- Clearance concept (as taught): track the post, prevent it from supporting their turn/brace, then flatten/redirect posture.

#### 6.5.8 Chest-to-chest passes to backtakes (pass/back coupling)
- Coupling rule:
  - If they turn toward you to deny the back, accept chest-to-chest and pass.
  - If they turn away to escape the pass, attach chest-to-back and take the back.
- This is presented as the “engine” of outside ashi conversions: passing pressure creates the turn-away that yields the back.

#### 6.5.9 Kata gatame backtake (token: katakitame)
- Head-and-arm lane used to create back exposure.
- Control idea: head control is the handle; keep the head from slipping out and away while you circle to the back line.
- If the head starts escaping:
  - prioritize re-anchoring head-line control before trying to insert hooks.

#### 6.5.10 Back head-and-arm backtake
- Related head-and-arm lane:
  - use the head-and-arm connection to prevent re-squaring and to access the back line when the opponent’s shoulders are aligned for it.
- Failure cue matches other lanes:
  - when the head frees, the conversion collapses; fix head control early.

#### 6.5.11 Backtakes from inversion (method family)
- Inversion used when the opponent’s reaction/angle prevents clean completion via the ride or knee-down pressure route.
- Completion focus remains:
  - reach chest-to-upper-back alignment,
  - maintain hip containment while you attach.

#### 6.5.12 V grip and scoot (angle change + entry tool)
- V-grip used as a lever to change angle and start the scoot-under sequence.
- Core objective: scoot under while keeping hip containment so the opponent cannot drift outside your knees during the transition.

#### 6.5.13 Half roll / full roll to back (depth selection)
- Half roll used when a smaller angle change can expose the back without losing top position.
- Full roll used when more rotation is required to reach the back line or to transition into side-body-lock stabilization.
- In both:
  - keep the back exposure goal (upper back) and head/upper-body connection in mind; rolls without connection are treated as transient.

#### 6.5.14 Clearing the knee from top ushiro
- Problem: the opponent’s knee blocks your ability to stabilize and progress through top ushiro lanes.
- Rule: clear the knee before expecting clean chest-to-chest pressure or clean back exposure.

#### 6.5.15 V grip from top oshiro transition
- V-grip concept reused to maintain angle control during transitions through top oshiro lanes.
- Goal: stop the opponent from re-forming knee–elbow structure as you transition and climb to upper-body control.

#### 6.5.16 Build to standing (recap)
- Standing build appears again as a completion tool when grounded routes stall.
- Safety constraints remain:
  - foot safety,
  - avoid Achilles control,
  - maintain containment and deny knee/foot re-insertion during the rise.

#### 6.5.17 Taking the back — knee-drop method (completion family)
- Completion family uses knee-drop as the finishing mechanic once inside-position and shoulder-line conditions are met.
- Use when:
  - forward pressure is available and the opponent’s shoulder relationship makes chest-to-back attachment the correct branch.

#### 6.5.18 Taking the back — rolling method (completion family)
- Completion family uses rolling/inversion mechanics to finish attachment when knee-drop completion is blocked or the opponent’s angle demands a rolling finish.
- Treated as a paired option with knee-drop (choose based on reaction/angle).

#### 6.5.19 Heel hooks to backtakes / passing (threat-to-conversion)
- Heel hook threat is used as leverage:
  - defensive hand-fighting/turning reactions create the opening for back exposure or passing pressure.
- The point is not “always finish the heel hook,” but to use the threat to force a predictable branch.

---

### 6.6 Part 5 — Top Ushiro + Cross Ashi

#### 6.6.1 Underhook → guard pass / back take (primary fork)
- Underhook is treated as a direct bridge to upper-body control.
- Branch logic:
  - opponent turns toward to block back attachment → accept chest-to-chest and pass.
  - opponent turns away to flee pressure → attach chest-to-back and take the back.

#### 6.6.2 Back head-and-arm lane → back/pass
- Head-and-arm control presented as dual-use:
  - if the back line opens, take the back,
  - if they block hooks and accept pin, convert to pass.
- Head control remains the handle; if head slips, the lane collapses.

#### 6.6.3 Kimura to back
- Kimura used as a rotational lever:
  - force shoulder rotation that exposes the back line.
- Treated as an upper-body tool that fits the overall conversion model (not a standalone submission chapter).

#### 6.6.4 Kimura to guard pass
- When the rotation does not yield clean back attachment:
  - use the same lever to flatten, pin, and pass.
- Reinforces the “leave with something” rule.

#### 6.6.5 3/4 mount → cross body ride
- Uses a pin state (3/4 mount) to transition into a ride state.
- Purpose: keep rotation controlled so the opponent cannot freely square and re-guard; ride feeds pass/back continuations.

#### 6.6.6 Cross ashi — hide your foot (gate)
- Same safety gate: no extended conversion if your foot is exposed.
- Solve foot safety first, then begin extraction/come-up.

#### 6.6.7 Primary leg extraction → body lock / backtake (spine of the system)
- Primary objective: extract the primary leg to remove the constraint that keeps you “stuck” in the entanglement.
- Once extracted:
  - come up (build to a knee),
  - connect body lock,
  - finish to the back if the line is there.

#### 6.6.8 Backstep from primary leg extraction (stabilization/angle change)
- Backstep is used immediately after extraction to stabilize on top and prevent re-guarding.
- Often used to land in ride/camping-like control so the exchange stays in your favour.

#### 6.6.9 Building to a knee (come-up milestone)
- Come-up is treated as a positional upgrade:
  - shifts the exchange from “leg fight” into “top control and finishing lanes.”
- Maintain structural constraints (knee–elbow connection, deny re-insertion) during the rise.

#### 6.6.10 Beating a cross-lat post (repeated barrier)
- Cross-lat posting appears as a common block to the come-up/body lock connection.
- Clearance required before expecting stable forward pressure or clean attachment.

#### 6.6.11 Passing/backtake dilemma (explicit pairing)
- If they block back attachment by turning toward and accepting pin → pass.
- If they turn away to flee the pass → take the back.
- Misdirection is used to exploit anticipation (force one defense, then take the other lane).

#### 6.6.12 Roll to cross body ride / inversion backtakes / half roll to backstep
- Alternate method families to keep progress when direct extraction/body lock line is resisted:
  - roll to reach ride stabilization,
  - inversion family to complete attachment,
  - half roll to create angle for backstep stabilization.

#### 6.6.13 Move back to top ushiro (recycle)
- If the leg exchange stabilizes into top-side control rather than continuing as a leg fight, return to top ushiro lanes.

#### 6.6.14 Body lock to back
- Body lock treated as a reliable terminal once come-up is achieved.
- Focus: keep hips contained and line up chest-to-upper-back before completing hooks.

#### 6.6.15 Heel hook to back
- Heel hook threat used as leverage to open the back line (or to force pass-first when the opponent’s defense blocks attachment).

---

### 6.7 Part 6 — Inside Ashi + 50/50 family

#### 6.7.1 Inside ashi — transfer to outside ashi
- Primary solution when inside ashi stalls:
  - transfer to outside ashi to access knee-down and stronger forward-pressure conversion routes.

#### 6.7.2 Half roll → backstep (common exit)
- Half roll used to create the angle required to backstep into stable top control.
- Purpose: avoid stalemate and preserve top advantage during the transition.

#### 6.7.3 Heel hook to back
- Heel hook threat functions as the lever:
  - defensive reactions create back exposure or passing openings.

#### 6.7.4 50/50 — separate legs first (gateway)
- 50/50 treated as a separation/extraction problem:
  - separate legs,
  - extract,
  - come up to top control and finish as pass/back.
- Without separation, forward pressure and clean come-ups are constrained.

#### 6.7.5 Half roll to backstep / build to standing (stall breakers)
- Half roll to backstep is a repeated exit to create angle.
- Build to standing is a repeated finisher when mat-based separation doesn’t resolve.

#### 6.7.6 Extraction → body lock/backtakes
- Extraction is the primary bridge into body lock and backtakes.
- Maintain structural control (deny knee/foot re-insertion) while coming up.

#### 6.7.7 Far leg butterfly hook to back take
- Named backtake route off the 50/50 family:
  - use the far-leg butterfly hook structure to open attachment and climb to the back.

#### 6.7.8 Backside 50/50 to backtake
- Backside orientation treated as a direct line to the back when the opponent’s hips/shoulders align for it.

#### 6.7.9 Far hip ashi / cross waist ashi / criss cross ashi (named variants)
- Presented as variant shapes used to continue the exchange when one configuration stalls.
- Used to create new angles for separation/extraction and to re-open pass/back conversions.

## 8.0 Application scenarios

### 8.1 You are in a leg entanglement and your foot safety is not solved yet
- Primary objective: solve “hide your foot” before attempting any large conversion.
- Secondary objective: deny Achilles control long enough to create an angle change.
- Decision rule: if Achilles control is strong, do not force back-chasing; route to safer stabilizations and re-pummel until the constraint changes.

### 8.2 You win the leg exchange but the opponent is starting to invert to recover
- Primary objective: prevent the opponent from fully inverting before you stabilize.
- Typical response family: pin/control the ankles and use a controlled method family (fall-to-hip or inversion) that maintains alignment.
- Success condition: end with chest-to-upper-back connection and centre-line alignment, not just a rotation.

### 8.3 You attempt a back take and the opponent denies hook insertion
- Immediate action: do not persist with a slipping attachment.
- Conversion: switch to tight waist (or an underhook passing lane) and begin passing pressure.
- Continuation expectation: as they defend the pass by turning away/exploding, re-open chest-to-back attachment.

### 8.4 The opponent turns toward you to deny the back
- Preferred branch: accept chest-to-chest pinning and pass-first work.
- Control requirement: keep hips contained (do not allow them to get hips outside your knees as you transition).
- Continuation expectation: the moment they turn away to flee the pin, attach to the back.

### 8.5 The opponent turns away (classic “back opens” reaction)
- Preferred branch: chase upper-back exposure, not lower-back rotation.
- Key checks:
  - hips remain inside your knees (containment),
  - head line stays controlled/high (do not allow head to slip out and away),
  - chest-to-upper-back with centre lines aligned before committing to hook insertion.

### 8.6 The opponent turtles or is attempting to turtle
- Anchor first: tight waist capture to stop the scramble and prevent a full stable turtle.
- Branch:
  - if hooks/attachment appear early, take the back,
  - if not, flatten and pass off the anchor rather than hovering behind turtle structure.

### 8.7 You are in outside ashi and want to convert to pressure-forward passing
- Gate checks:
  - separate the opponent’s legs first,
  - Achilles control must not be locking you.
- Then shift to knee-down forward pressure mode:
  - heel-to-butt functional posture cue,
  - come forward into chest-to-chest pins when shoulder-line rule says chest-to-back is not available.

### 8.8 You are blocked by a cross-lat / cross-shoulder post while trying to come forward
- Recognize it as the primary frame barrier that prevents forward pressure and shoulder-line advantage.
- Priority: clear the post/frame, then re-apply:
  - elbow vs shoulder battle (win shoulder inside elbow),
  - top-side shoulder rule to choose chest-to-back vs chest-to-chest.

### 8.9 You are unsure whether to go chest-to-back or chest-to-chest
- Apply the top-side shoulder rule:
  - top-side shoulder in front of bottom-shoulder line → chest-to-back.
  - top-side shoulder behind that line → chest-to-chest and pass-first.
- If frames/posts prevent clean reading, clear frames first, then re-check.

### 8.10 You are stuck in 50/50 (symmetry/stalemate)
- Treat it as a separation/extraction problem:
  - separate legs,
  - use half roll to backstep or build to standing to break the stalemate.
- Conversion targets:
  - extract to body lock/back,
  - or pass-first when they turn toward to deny the back.

### 8.11 You are losing the head-and-arm control while converting
- Treat head slip as an emergency:
  - close the head line early (forehead-to-forehead) before continuing the come-up.
- Reinforce structure:
  - maintain knee–elbow connection to deny the opponent rebuilding inside position while the head is escaping.



## 9.0 Drilling progressions

### 9.1 Foundational constraint drills (solo/partner light)
- Foot-hiding reps (irimi / cross ashi contexts)
  - Reps focused on retracting the foot and orienting it to reduce exposure.
  - Add partner “hand fishing” for the heel as light resistance; goal is continuous foot safety while you angle.
- Achilles constraint awareness
  - Partner maintains an Achilles grip; you rep only the safe responses (do not chase the back).
  - Then partner releases the grip on cue; you immediately transition into your chosen conversion family.

### 9.2 Alignment and exposure drills (partner)
- Upper vs lower back exposure recognition
  - Start with partial rotation: your job is to upgrade to chest-to-upper-back + centre-line alignment (not just “turn them”).
  - Partner’s job is to re-square; your job is to maintain connection or convert to pin/pass.
- Hips-inside-knees containment
  - Start in a “near-back” attachment where the defender tries to drift hips outside your knees.
  - Your goal: keep containment while you scoot/adjust to stay behind; if containment breaks, you immediately switch to a pin/pass lane.

### 9.3 Reaction-led branch drilling (structured resistance)
- Turn-away branch
  - Start in an entanglement with the defender instructed to turn away on a cue.
  - Attacker reps attaching chest-to-upper-back, maintaining head line, and finishing into back control.
- Turn-toward branch
  - Same start, defender turns toward to deny hooks.
  - Attacker reps accepting chest-to-chest pins and entering the passing lane immediately (no hook chase).
- Turtle / attempted turtle branch
  - Start from a conversion moment; defender goes to turtle/attempted turtle.
  - Attacker reps tight waist anchor first, then:
    - back take if the line is present,
    - or flatten-and-pass if hooks are blocked.

### 9.4 Method-family progressions (limited options → full options)
- Irimi family: hipdrop vs inversion
  - Phase 1: only hipdrop attempts.
  - Phase 2: only inversion attempts.
  - Phase 3: defender chooses the reaction; attacker chooses method family based on hip orientation (square vs stagger cue).
- Forward roll vs inversion
  - Phase 1: forward roll entries with emphasis on staying safe (do not accept bottom position).
  - Phase 2: inversion entries with emphasis on maintaining alignment/connection.
  - Phase 3: attacker chooses whichever keeps them in top-control lanes when defended.

### 9.5 Outside ashi pressure-mode progressions (knee-down theory)
- Separation first
  - Drill only the leg separation prerequisite until it is consistent.
- Functional knee-down posture
  - Drill knee-down with the “heel-to-butt” posture cue as the success criterion.
  - Add defender trying to re-establish Achilles control; if they get it, attacker aborts pressure mode and re-solves.
- Frame-clearing gate sequence
  - Drill: elbow vs shoulder battle → clear cross-lat post → apply top-side shoulder rule → choose chest-to-back vs chest-to-chest.
  - Add light resistance: defender keeps elbow inside + posts cross-lat; attacker must clear before progressing.

### 9.6 Stabilization layer drilling (camping / ride)
- Camping entries
  - Drill forward step and backstep entries into camping.
  - Defender alternates: accept pin (turn toward) vs flee (turn away).
  - Attacker reps immediate pass on accept-pin; immediate back attachment on flee.
- Cross-body ride stabilization
  - Drill backstep → cross-body ride.
  - If ride fails, immediate guard pass conversion (explicit failure branch).

### 9.7 50/50 family resolution progressions
- Separation/extraction loop
  - Drill: separate legs → extract → come-up → body lock/back or pass-first.
- Stall breakers
  - Drill half roll → backstep as the default “get unstuck” option.
  - Drill build to standing as the other “finish the conversion” option.
- Named backtake routes
  - Drill far-leg butterfly hook to back take.
  - Drill backside 50/50 to backtake.

### 9.8 Short positional games (constraints + scoring)
- Game A: “Back or pass”
  - Start in chosen entanglement.
  - Score only for a clean back attachment or a stabilized pass pin; reset immediately on score.
- Game B: “No hook chase”
  - Start in backtake attempt position.
  - Defender’s goal: deny hooks.
  - Attacker’s goal: if hooks denied, must convert to pin/pass within a short count.
- Game C: “Frame clearing”
  - Start in outside ashi pressure mode with defender posting cross-lat.
  - Attacker cannot advance until post is cleared and elbow/shoulder battle is won.



## 10.0 Four-week curriculum

Structure notes
- 4 weeks, 3 sessions per week (12 sessions total).
- Each session is built around: one position focus + one conversion family + one failure branch.
- Default objective every session: finish the exchange with either a back take or a pass (no resets).

### Week 1 — Foundations and Irimi Ashi conversion spine

#### Session 1: Foundations (concept checks)
- Focus: cranial shift; upper vs lower back exposure; hips-inside-knees containment.
- Technique focus: chest-to-upper-back connection + centre-line alignment as the backtake completion state.
- Constraint work: foot-hiding and Achilles constraint awareness.
- Positional game: “back or pass” from a controlled leg exchange start.

#### Session 2: Irimi Ashi — foot safety and first conversions
- Focus: hide your foot; basic irimi structure; initial conversion attempts.
- Conversion family: hipdrop vs inversion as the primary decision pair.
- Failure branch: failed back take → tight waist guard pass.

#### Session 3: Irimi Ashi — roll families + pass integration
- Focus: forward roll back takes vs inversion; half roll to underhook passing/back access.
- Conversion family: roll selection tied to hip orientation and maintaining top advantage.
- Failure branch: backtake denied → underhook passing or north-south reroute.

### Week 2 — Reaction-led branching + camping stabilizations

#### Session 4: Reaction branches (turn away vs turn toward)
- Focus: read the reaction and choose branch immediately.
- Branch A: turn away → chest-to-back attachment.
- Branch B: turn toward → chest-to-chest pin and pass-first work.
- Game: defender alternates turn-away/turn-toward on cue.

#### Session 5: Turtle / attempted turtle branch
- Focus: tight waist as the anchor.
- Conversion family: anchor first, then back if available; otherwise flatten-and-pass.
- Game: start from conversion moment; defender turtles/attempts turtle.

#### Session 6: Camping positions (stabilize then finish)
- Focus: forward step/backstep entries to camping; limit rotation.
- Outcomes: pass on accept-pin; back on flee/turn-away.
- Failure branch: if camping entry fails, reroute to north-south or underhook passing.

### Week 3 — Outside Ashi (pressure mode + frame clearing + completion families)

#### Session 7: Outside Ashi — knee-down pressure mode
- Focus: separate legs → functional knee-down posture (heel-to-butt cue).
- Constraint: Achilles control blocks pressure; solve/avoid before committing.
- Outcome: pressure forward into chest-to-chest pins or open chest-to-back.

#### Session 8: Outside Ashi — inside-position gates
- Focus: elbow vs shoulder battle; clear cross-lat post.
- Decision filter: top-side shoulder rule (chest-to-back vs chest-to-chest).
- Game: defender maintains cross-lat post; attacker must clear before advancing.

#### Session 9: Outside Ashi — completions
- Focus: backstep to cross body ride; full roll to side body lock.
- Completion families: knee-drop method vs rolling method.
- Failure branch: failed cross body ride → guard pass immediately.

### Week 4 — Top Ushiro / Cross Ashi / 50-50 family resolutions

#### Session 10: Top Ushiro — underhook and head/arm lanes
- Focus: underhook → pass/back fork; head-and-arm lanes; kimura leverage.
- Outcome: pass on accept-pin; back on turn-away.
- Game: start in top-side control; defender alternates reactions.

#### Session 11: Cross Ashi — extraction to body lock/back
- Focus: hide foot → primary leg extraction → build to a knee → body lock → back.
- Barrier: cross-lat post during come-up; clear then attach.
- Stabilization branch: backstep/roll to cross body ride when direct line is resisted.

#### Session 12: 50/50 family — separate, extract, finish
- Focus: separation gateway; half roll to backstep; build to standing.
- Outcomes: extraction → body lock/back; pass-first when they turn toward.
- Named routes: far-leg butterfly hook to back; backside 50/50 to backtake.



## 10.0 Four-week curriculum (expanded density)

Structure
- 4 weeks, 3 sessions/week (12 sessions).
- Every session has:
  - A-position focus (where you are starting / what you are trying to stabilize).
  - A-conversion family (how you move from leg exchange into upper-body outcomes).
  - A-failure branch (what you do the moment the first choice is denied).
- Default completion standards:
  - Back outcome: chest-to-upper-back connection + centre line alignment before hook pursuit.
  - Pass outcome: chest-to-chest pinning lane with forward pressure (do not accept loose “almost passed” states).
- Default constraints to monitor every session:
  - Foot safety (hide foot).
  - Achilles constraint (if strong, do not force pressure-forward or back-chasing lines).
  - Hip containment (hips inside knees).
  - Head-line control (do not allow head to slip out and away during build-ups).

### Week 1 — Foundations and Irimi Ashi conversion spine

#### Session 1: Foundations (core checks + common outcomes)
- Primary focus
  - Cranial shift: leg exchange -> head/shoulder-line control.
  - Upper vs lower back exposure: insist on upper-back connection as completion.
  - Hip containment: hips inside knees as continuous diagnostic.
- Conversion family
  - “Back or pass” pairing concept: do not separate these as unrelated paths.
- Failure branch
  - Back denied -> immediate chest-to-chest pins and pass lanes (tight waist / underhooks).
- Key drilling blocks
  - Constraint reps: foot-hiding under light hand-fishing pressure.
  - Exposure reps: upgrade lower-back rotation into upper-back connection (or switch to pin).
  - Containment reps: defender tries to drift hips outside knees; attacker either re-contains or converts to pin/pass.
- Mini-games
  - Game A: score only for clean back attachment or stabilized pass pin; reset on score.
  - Game B: “no hook chase” (if hooks are denied, must convert to pin/pass quickly).
- Success criteria
  - Fewer stalled backtake attempts; faster, cleaner conversions into pins when the back is denied.

#### Session 2: Irimi Ashi (foot safety + first conversion pairing)
- Primary focus
  - Hide your foot as the entry gate.
  - Establish working Irimi structure that allows conversion attempts without exposing heel/foot.
- Conversion family
  - Hipdrop/fall-to-hip versus inversion family (selection by angle and reaction).
- Failure branch
  - Failed back attachment -> tight waist as the anchor -> pass lane.
- Key drilling blocks
  - Foot-hiding rounds: partner actively hunts heel; attacker maintains safety while building angle.
  - Method-family rounds: attacker alternates hipdrop attempts and inversion attempts (same start, different completion).
  - Failure-branch rounds: defender denies hooks; attacker must snap to tight waist and begin pass pressure.
- Mini-games
  - Game: defender’s only goal is to deny hooks; attacker’s only goal is to finish with pass pin (no resets).
- Success criteria
  - Immediate recognition of “back not attaching” and automatic tight waist conversion.

#### Session 3: Irimi Ashi (roll families + pass integration)
- Primary focus
  - Forward roll versus inversion as method families.
  - Half roll to underhook passing/back access as a “stay on top” converter.
- Conversion family
  - Roll selection tied to maintaining top advantage and preserving the pass/back dilemma.
- Failure branch
  - Roll attempt denied -> underhook passing / north-south reroute / camping stabilization.
- Key drilling blocks
  - Half roll -> underhook lane: defender alternates turn toward vs turn away to force pass vs back choice.
  - Forward step -> north-south: practice rerouting when direct attachment line is blocked.
  - Backstep/step -> camping entry: stabilize rotation and then finish as pass/back depending on reaction.
- Mini-games
  - Game: “stay on top” constraint (any sequence that drops you to bottom is considered a failure; must choose safer method family).
- Success criteria
  - Cleaner transitions into underhook/north-south without losing top position.

### Week 2 — Reaction-led branching + camping stabilizations

#### Session 4: Reaction branches (turn away vs turn toward)
- Primary focus
  - Read the reaction early and commit to the correct lane (do not hesitate between pass and back).
- Conversion family
  - Turn away -> chest-to-back attachment lane.
  - Turn toward -> chest-to-chest pin lane -> pass.
- Failure branch
  - If you guessed wrong (reaction flips mid-sequence), re-anchor head-line and hip containment, then re-route.
- Key drilling blocks
  - Reaction reps: defender must switch reaction on cue (turn away / turn toward), attacker must finish the correct lane.
  - Containment reps: defender tries to “hip-escape outside knees” during back chase; attacker either re-contains or pins and passes.
- Mini-games
  - Game: attacker scores only if they choose the correct lane within a short count after the reaction becomes clear.
- Success criteria
  - Faster branch commitment; fewer stalled “in between” positions.

#### Session 5: Turtle / attempted turtle branch (tight waist anchor)
- Primary focus
  - Tight waist as the stabilization anchor when the opponent tries to hide the back line via turtle.
- Conversion family
  - Anchor first, then choose:
    - back take if attachment appears,
    - flatten and pass if hooks/back line is blocked.
- Failure branch
  - If turtle stabilizes, do not hover behind it; either flatten or re-route to a pass lane immediately.
- Key drilling blocks
  - Attempted turtle capture: start in the transition window (not fully formed turtle).
  - Full turtle: start with turtle already stable; attacker must anchor then flatten/pass.
  - Reaction chaining: after flatten, defender tries to turn away to flee pin; attacker attaches to back.
- Mini-games
  - Game: defender’s objective is to achieve stable turtle; attacker’s objective is to prevent it and finish pass/back.
- Success criteria
  - Tight waist becomes automatic; fewer resets from turtle situations.

#### Session 6: Camping positions (stabilize rotation, then finish)
- Primary focus
  - Use camping as stabilization to limit rotation and force predictable branches.
- Conversion family
  - Entries: forward step / backstep / stabilization after a failed backtake.
  - Exits: accept-pin -> pass; flee/turn-away -> back.
- Failure branch
  - If camping entry fails, reroute to north-south or underhook passing (do not re-enter loose leg chaos).
- Key drilling blocks
  - Entry reps: forward step to camping; backstep to camping (same start, different entry).
  - “Two reactions” reps: defender must alternate accept-pin vs flee; attacker must finish accordingly.
  - Fail-safe reps: camping entry denial -> immediate north-south or underhook lane.
- Mini-games
  - Game: score only from camping (must stabilize first, then finish).
- Success criteria
  - Camping becomes a reliable “reset without resetting” platform.

### Week 3 — Outside Ashi (pressure mode + frame clearing + completion families)

#### Session 7: Outside Ashi — knee-down pressure mode (separation first)
- Primary focus
  - Separate legs -> functional knee-down posture -> forward pressure.
- Conversion family
  - Pressure-forward conversions into chest-to-chest pins and pass lanes, with back as the secondary outcome when they flee.
- Failure branch
  - If Achilles constraint is strong or separation fails, abort pressure mode and re-solve; do not force.
- Key drilling blocks
  - Separation reps as a standalone skill.
  - Functional knee-down reps (posture that supports forward pressure, not cosmetic knee contact).
  - Pressure to pin reps: goal is stable chest-to-chest (then pass), not loose forward movement.
- Mini-games
  - Game: attacker can only advance after demonstrating separation + functional knee-down posture.
- Success criteria
  - More reliable forward pressure, fewer “stuck with knee down but no progress” outcomes.

#### Session 8: Outside Ashi — inside-position gates (frames and posts)
- Primary focus
  - Elbow vs shoulder battle (win inside shoulder position).
  - Clear cross-lat/cross-shoulder posting barrier.
  - Apply top-side shoulder rule to choose chest-to-back vs chest-to-chest.
- Conversion family
  - Gate sequence: inside position -> frame cleared -> shoulder-rule decision -> finish lane.
- Failure branch
  - If the frame reappears mid-advance, re-clear and re-check (do not push through the barrier).
- Key drilling blocks
  - Gate-only rounds: defender’s only job is elbow-inside + cross-lat post; attacker’s only job is to win inside and clear.
  - Shoulder-rule rounds: once gates are cleared, defender alternates shoulder relationship; attacker must choose correct lane.
- Mini-games
  - Game: attacker cannot score without visibly clearing the frame first.
- Success criteria
  - Cleaner progress into either chest-to-back or chest-to-chest without stalling on frames.

#### Session 9: Outside Ashi — completions (ride / side body lock / backtake families)
- Primary focus
  - Backstep -> cross body ride stabilization.
  - Full roll -> side body lock stabilization.
  - Completion families: knee-drop method vs rolling method.
- Conversion family
  - Stabilize first, then finish; treat ride/side body lock as the platform.
- Failure branch
  - Failed cross body ride -> immediate guard pass (explicit branch).
- Key drilling blocks
  - Backstep to ride entry reps; ride maintenance; finish as pass/back.
  - Full roll to side body lock reps; stabilize; finish as pass/back.
  - Completion family rounds: alternate knee-drop completion and rolling completion (same start, different finish).
- Mini-games
  - Game: “ride sticks or pass” (if ride fails, must immediately convert to pass; cannot re-enter entanglement).
- Success criteria
  - Stable ride/side body lock time increases; fewer scrambles.

### Week 4 — Top Ushiro / Cross Ashi / 50-50 family resolutions

#### Session 10: Top Ushiro — underhook + head/arm + kimura integration
- Primary focus
  - Use top-side control as a conversion hub: underhooks, head-and-arm lanes, kimura leverage.
- Conversion family
  - Underhook fork: accept-pin -> pass; flee/turn-away -> back.
  - Head-and-arm fork: back opens -> attach; back denied -> pin/pass.
  - Kimura fork: rotate to back; if rotation yields pin instead, pass.
- Failure branch
  - If head-line slips or inside position is lost, re-anchor control before advancing (do not chase behind a slipping head).
- Key drilling blocks
  - Underhook rounds: defender alternates turn toward vs turn away; attacker must finish correct lane.
  - Head-and-arm rounds: defender’s goal is to free head; attacker’s goal is to keep head-line and finish pass/back.
  - Kimura rounds: defender blocks rotation; attacker must accept pass branch rather than forcing back.
- Mini-games
  - Game: “one tool per round” (underhook only / head-and-arm only / kimura only) then “all tools allowed.”
- Success criteria
  - Cleaner decision-making: no forcing the wrong tool; automatic pass conversion when the back is denied.

#### Session 11: Cross Ashi — extraction to come-up to body lock/back
- Primary focus
  - Primary leg extraction as the spine.
  - Build to a knee as the key milestone.
  - Body lock as the terminal connector to back control.
- Conversion family
  - Direct line: extract -> come up -> body lock -> back.
  - Stabilization line: extraction resisted -> backstep/roll -> ride/camp -> pass/back.
- Failure branch
  - Cross-lat post barrier: clear it; if cannot clear, stabilize and pass rather than forcing attachment.
- Key drilling blocks
  - Extraction-only rounds: emphasize clean removal of the primary constraint.
  - Come-up rounds: defender tries to re-insert knee/foot; attacker maintains structure and completes come-up.
  - Body lock rounds: defender denies back; attacker must pass-first rather than chase hooks.
- Mini-games
  - Game: score only if you reach body lock or a stabilized pass pin within a short count after extraction.
- Success criteria
  - Higher extraction-to-come-up success; fewer stalls after extraction.

#### Session 12: 50/50 family — separate, extract, finish (stall breakers)
- Primary focus
  - Treat 50/50 as separation/extraction first.
  - Use half roll -> backstep or build to standing to break stalemates.
- Conversion family
  - Separation -> extraction -> come-up -> body lock/back or pass-first.
  - Named backtake routes: far-leg butterfly hook to back; backside 50/50 to backtake.
- Failure branch
  - If separation fails, do not “wait”; trigger a stall breaker (half roll/backstep or stand).
- Key drilling blocks
  - Separation reps under increasing resistance.
  - Stall-breaker reps (half roll/backstep; stand-up).
  - Named route reps (far-leg butterfly hook; backside orientation).
- Mini-games
  - Game: “no stalemates” (if you spend too long in symmetry, you must trigger a stall breaker immediately).
- Success criteria
  - Faster exits from symmetrical entanglement; higher rate of ending in back or pass.


## 11.0 Failure patterns (expanded density)

### 11.1 Backtake “completion error”: chasing hooks without upper-back connection
- What it looks like
  - You are behind them “a bit” but your chest is not connected to the upper back and your centre line is not aligned.
  - You reach for hooks anyway, often while their shoulders/head are still free.
- Why it fails
  - Without chest-to-upper-back connection, hook attempts become a race you lose: they square hips, free the head line, and strip the attachment.
- Typical downstream failure
  - Hips drift outside your knees and you end up riding too high/too loose, or you fall into a scramble with no pin.
- Fix
  - Rebuild the completion state first: chest-to-upper-back + centre-line alignment.
  - If you cannot rebuild it immediately, stop hook-chasing and convert into chest-to-chest pins (pass lane).

### 11.2 Alignment collapse: letting hips drift outside your knees during the chase
- What it looks like
  - As they rotate, their hips slide outside your knee line and your attachment becomes “hanging on.”
- Why it fails
  - Hip containment is the structural support that makes hook insertion and chest-to-back control stable.
- Typical downstream failure
  - They turn in, re-guard, or step the hips out and you lose the back line completely.
- Fix
  - Treat hips-inside-knees as a constant diagnostic during all roll/inversion/build-up families.
  - If containment is lost: immediately re-route to pin/pass lanes rather than continuing the backtake line.

### 11.3 Constraint violation: ignoring Achilles control
- What it looks like
  - You try to come forward (pressure mode, knee-down, or back chase) while they still have meaningful Achilles control.
- Why it fails
  - Achilles control is a hard limiter on your mobility and your ability to generate forward pressure; you are forcing a blocked line.
- Typical downstream failure
  - You stall, get extended, or give them enough time to re-form frames and re-square.
- Fix
  - Treat Achilles control as a gate: if it is strong, either clear/deny it first or choose a different branch that does not require forward pressure/back chase.

### 11.4 “Cosmetic knee-down”: knee touches but pressure does not exist
- What it looks like
  - You drop the knee to the mat but you cannot drive forward; you remain stuck in place.
- Why it fails
  - Knee-down is only meaningful when leg separation and posture allow forward pressure (heel-to-butt cue). Without that, you are stationary.
- Typical downstream failure
  - The opponent keeps frames, posts, or rebuilds guard; you are “committed” but not progressing.
- Fix
  - Rebuild prerequisites: separate legs and create the posture that allows forward pressure; if Achilles control blocks this, abandon pressure mode.

### 11.5 Gate failure: losing elbow/shoulder inside position (cannot come forward)
- What it looks like
  - Their elbow stays inside your shoulder line and their hand stays inside, so you cannot pressure forward or align for chest-to-back.
- Why it fails
  - You cannot win the forward-pressure lane until you win “shoulder inside elbow.”
- Typical downstream failure
  - You push forward into a wall, burn effort, and allow them to re-square or re-guard.
- Fix
  - Stop trying to advance; first push the elbow across and win inside shoulder position, then re-apply pressure and shoulder-line decisions.

### 11.6 Frame barrier: failing to clear the cross-lat / cross-shoulder post
- What it looks like
  - They establish the cross-lat post and you attempt to apply pressure or shoulder-line choices anyway.
- Why it fails
  - The post is a mechanical block to your forward advance and to the shoulder relationship you need for chest-to-back/chest-to-chest transitions.
- Typical downstream failure
  - You get stalled and they regain alignment; you lose the moment to convert.
- Fix
  - Treat the post as a required clearance step:
    - clear it first,
    - then re-check elbow/shoulder and the top-side shoulder rule before choosing the lane.

### 11.7 Head-line leak: allowing the head to slip out and away during the come-up
- What it looks like
  - You begin building height but the opponent’s head walks out/away; the head-and-arm or back-head-and-arm lane collapses.
- Why it fails
  - The head line is the steering wheel for the cranial shift; once it escapes, they can re-square and rebuild structure.
- Typical downstream failure
  - They bring knees up to elbows, re-form defensive connection, and you lose the conversion window.
- Fix
  - Treat head slip as an emergency:
    - close head-to-head early (forehead-to-forehead cue),
    - then continue the build-up only after head control is re-established.

### 11.8 Branching mistake: treating “turn toward” as still a backtake moment
- What it looks like
  - They turn toward you to deny hooks, and you keep trying to force chest-to-back attachment.
- Why it fails
  - Turn-toward defense closes the back line; hook pursuit becomes low percentage and wastes the conversion window.
- Typical downstream failure
  - They stabilize frames and you lose both the back and the pin.
- Fix
  - Accept chest-to-chest pinning and commit to passing when they turn toward; expect later turn-away reactions to re-open back access.

### 11.9 Branching mistake: treating “turn away” as only a passing moment
- What it looks like
  - They flee/turn away from pins and you keep chasing passing rather than attaching to the back line.
- Why it fails
  - Turn-away is often the cleanest back exposure condition; if you ignore it, you let the most valuable window pass.
- Typical downstream failure
  - You chase a moving target and allow a re-guard rather than finishing attachment.
- Fix
  - When the opponent turns away, prioritize chest-to-back attachment and upper-back exposure completion.

### 11.10 Failure-branch omission: not converting immediately after a failed backtake
- What it looks like
  - Hooks are denied or the attachment slips, but you keep trying “one more time” instead of switching lanes.
- Why it fails
  - The opponent is already organized defensively; your second and third attempts are lower quality and cost time/position.
- Typical downstream failure
  - You lose the top-control moment and fall back into a scramble.
- Fix
  - Use the designed conversions immediately:
    - tight waist anchor and pass,
    - underhook passing,
    - north-south reroute,
    - camping stabilization,
    - ride/side body lock stabilizations when available.

### 11.11 Turtle timing error: arriving late to the turtle (anchor comes after structure)
- What it looks like
  - You chase behind the turtle after it is fully formed instead of capturing the attempted turtle transition.
- Why it fails
  - Once the turtle structure is stable, hooks/back access and flattening require more effort and give the defender time to build/stand.
- Typical downstream failure
  - You hover without progress or get shaken off into a scramble.
- Fix
  - Anchor earlier: tight waist capture during attempted turtle; if late, flatten first and pass rather than chasing hooks behind a stable turtle.

### 11.12 50/50 stalemate pattern: staying symmetrical without triggering a stall breaker
- What it looks like
  - You remain in symmetrical 50/50 without separation, extraction, or come-up.
- Why it fails
  - The conversion engine stops; you are no longer forcing reactions or creating exposure.
- Typical downstream failure
  - Time passes; the opponent organizes defenses, and your chances to convert shrink.
- Fix
  - Treat separation as the gateway; if you cannot separate quickly, trigger a stall breaker:
    - half roll to backstep, or
    - build to standing.


## 12.0 Key passages (expanded density)

### 12.1 Multi-threat framing (dilemma model)
- Core idea: single threats are manageable; layered threats force the defender to “choose a loss.”
- Key framing analogy used: defending becomes harder as the “goal” you must cover expands (more simultaneous openings).
- Operational takeaway: every sequence should be built so that the opponent’s best defense to Outcome A increases exposure to Outcome B (backtake ↔ pass).

### 12.2 The central objective: convert leg exchanges into upper-body outcomes
- Stated emphasis: the technical difference is not “new moves,” it is timing and conversion between domains (legs → upper body).
- The system is presented as a conversion engine:
  - start in leg entanglement control,
  - force a predictable reaction,
  - convert to either chest-to-back attachment or chest-to-chest pinning.
- “Leave with something” is treated as a standard: if the first outcome is denied, the exchange must still end in advantage (pass lane / stabilization).

### 12.3 Passing and backtaking are not separate chapters (they are paired branches)
- Repeated pairing logic:
  - If they turn toward you to deny hooks/back attachment, they are often accepting pin pressure → pass.
  - If they turn away to escape pins/pressure, they often expose the back → take the back.
- The pairing is presented as a loop, not a one-time choice:
  - pass pressure produces turn-away,
  - turn-away produces back exposure,
  - back defense often produces pin acceptance again.

### 12.4 Upper vs lower back exposure (what “counts” as real back access)
- Clear standard used: rotation alone is not enough; you must upgrade exposure into control.
- Completion condition is repeatedly framed as:
  - chest connected to upper back,
  - centre lines aligned.
- Practical warning embedded: chasing hooks without the completion state produces slipping attachments and resets.

### 12.5 Cranial shift (named bridge from legs to finishing lanes)
- Core statement: without upper-body control, you cannot reliably finish passing or back takes even if legs are “won.”
- The cranial shift is framed as the moment you stop being “leg-focused” and begin controlling the head/shoulder line.
- Applied meaning:
  - you transition into upper-body anchors (tight waist, underhooks, head-and-arm circles),
  - you prioritize controlling the head line when it begins to slip.

### 12.6 Head-line control is a hard gate during conversions
- A recurring “stop and fix” cue: if the head starts slipping out and away during the come-up, address it immediately.
- The head line is treated as the steering wheel for conversion:
  - lose it → opponent squares and rebuilds structure,
  - keep it → you complete attachment or maintain pinning pressure.
- Practical enforcement: head-to-head closure early in the build-up is framed as preventing the opponent from creating the angle that frees them.

### 12.7 Hips-inside-knees diagnostic (backtake reliability rule)
- Stated diagnostic:
  - hips inside your knees → back is available,
  - hips outside your knees → you are losing the back.
- The passage functions as a constant check during:
  - scooting underneath,
  - roll/inversion families,
  - hook insertion attempts.
- Consequence: when the diagnostic fails (hips drifting out), the correct move is often branch change (pin/pass) rather than forcing hook work.

### 12.8 Hip orientation as a method selector (roll vs hip-based options)
- A practical selector is given:
  - hips square → forward-roll family becomes viable,
  - hips staggered/angled → hip-based fall/hipdrop family becomes viable.
- The point is not stylistic preference; it is matching the method to the geometry so you preserve alignment and stay on top.

### 12.9 Rule of the Achilles (the constraint that changes what is possible)
- Achilles control is framed as the defender’s “saving” constraint.
- Practical implication stated: if Achilles control is strong, certain conversions (especially direct back-chasing and pressure-forward upgrades) become extremely difficult.
- Decision rule: treat Achilles control as a gate—solve/deny it or choose a branch that does not depend on free leg mobility and forward pressure.

### 12.10 Knee-down theory (functional requirements, dependencies)
- Knee-down is framed as a meaningful mode shift only when it is functional:
  - leg separation is required,
  - posture that allows forward pressure is required (heel-to-butt cue used).
- Dependency is emphasized: Achilles control prevents the functional knee-down posture and therefore blocks pressure-forward passing.

### 12.11 Elbow vs shoulder battle + cross-lat posting barrier
- Inside-position gate stated:
  - if the opponent keeps elbow/hand inside your shoulder line, you cannot come forward effectively.
  - you must reverse that relationship (shoulder inside elbow).
- A common high-level barrier is described:
  - strong cross-lat / cross-shoulder posting stops forward advance and delays your ability to apply shoulder-line decisions.
- Practical enforcement: clear the post, win inside position, then proceed—do not try to “power through” the barrier.

### 12.12 Top-side shoulder rule (back vs pin filter)
- A clear heuristic is stated:
  - shoulder relationship determines whether chest-to-back is available or whether chest-to-chest pinning is the correct continuation.
- The rule is framed as actionable:
  - you re-check it after clearing frames/posts,
  - you do not force the “wrong lane” if the shoulder relationship indicates the other branch.

- North-south lane
  - A top-pin reroute used when direct attachment is blocked, maintaining passing pressure with back re-openings on turn-away.

### 13.6 Failure-pattern tokens (short labels used in Section 11)
- Hook-chasing (without completion)
  - Pursuing hooks before chest-to-upper-back + centre-line alignment is secured.
- Containment leak
  - Allowing hips to drift outside knees during back pursuit.
- Cosmetic knee-down
  - Knee to mat without separation/posture sufficient for forward pressure.
- Frame lock
  - Cross-lat post / elbow-inside structure preventing forward advance and shoulder-rule application.
- Head-line leak
  - Allowing head to slip out and away during come-up, collapsing the conversion window.
- Stalemate (50/50)
  - Remaining in symmetrical 50/50 without triggering separation/extraction or a stall-breaker (half roll/backstep; build to standing).


## 14.0 Additional notes (full density)

### 14.1 Operational defaults (what you do unless a constraint forces a different choice)
- Every exchange is treated as a “finish the conversion” problem:
  - back take if attachment is available,
  - pass if the opponent’s defense forces pin acceptance,
  - stabilize (camping/ride/north-south) if neither outcome is immediately clean, then re-run the pass/back dilemma.
- Do not treat “failed backtake” as failure; it is the designed trigger to enter the pass lane.
- Do not treat “failed pass pressure” as failure; opponent turn-away responses are treated as the designed trigger to enter the back lane.
- Conversion priority order when the position is unstable:
  1) re-secure safety (foot; Achilles constraint awareness),
  2) re-secure alignment (hip containment; head-line control),
  3) re-enter a control lane (tight waist / underhook / chest-to-chest / ride / camping / north-south),
  4) finish as back or pass.

### 14.2 “What to look at” checklist (diagnostics used mid-exchange)
- Foot safety status
  - If foot is exposed, do not commit to large rotations or come-ups.
  - Re-solve foot-hiding first, then proceed.
- Achilles constraint status
  - If Achilles control is meaningful, treat back-chasing and pressure-forward as constrained.
  - Either clear/deny the control, or choose a branch that does not require that freedom.
- Hip containment status (hips inside knees)
  - If hips are inside knees, back pursuit remains mechanically supported.
  - If hips drift outside knees, treat the back as degrading and switch to pin/pass stabilization.
- Head-line status (head slipping out and away)
  - If the head starts escaping during a come-up, treat it as an immediate stop-and-fix.
  - If you ignore it, the opponent re-squares and rebuilds structure.
- Frame/post status (cross-lat posting barrier)
  - If the cross-lat post or similar posting barrier is present, forward progress is gated.
  - Clear the barrier, then re-apply inside-position/shoulder-line decisions.
- Leg separation status (for pressure-forward work)
  - Without separation, knee-down is cosmetic and forward pressure does not exist.
  - With separation plus functional posture, pressure-forward passing becomes viable.

### 14.3 Branch selection rules (reaction -> lane mapping)
- Turn away
  - Treated as the “back opens” reaction.
  - Priority: chest-to-upper-back connection + centre-line alignment before hook pursuit.
  - Continuous requirement: hips remain contained inside your knees during the chase.
- Turn toward
  - Treated as the “pin is available” reaction (they are denying hooks/back line).
  - Priority: accept chest-to-chest pin and commit to passing rather than chasing the back.
  - Expectation: passing pressure often causes later turn-away reactions that re-open the back lane.
- Turtle / attempted turtle
  - Treated as an anchoring trigger.
  - Priority: tight waist anchor first; then:
    - if hooks/back line appears, finish the back,
    - if not, flatten and pass off the anchor (do not hover behind stable turtle).
- Post/frame (cross-lat barrier)
  - Treated as a gating problem.
  - Priority: clear frame/post first; then:
    - win elbow vs shoulder inside-position gate,
    - apply top-side shoulder rule to choose chest-to-back vs chest-to-chest.

### 14.4 Lane selection rules (shoulder-line and inside-position gates)
- Elbow vs shoulder gate
  - If the opponent’s elbow/hand is inside your shoulder line, you cannot come forward effectively.
  - Win shoulder-inside-elbow first, then advance.
- Top-side shoulder rule as a consistent filter
  - Use shoulder relationship to decide chest-to-back vs chest-to-chest.
  - If frames/posts block the decision, clear them first and re-check rather than forcing the wrong lane.

### 14.5 Method-family selection rules (which completion family fits this geometry)
- Hip orientation cue
  - Hips square: forward-roll family is often the fitting method family.
  - Hips staggered/angled: hipdrop/fall-to-hip family is often the fitting method family.
- Safety and risk rule
  - If a method family tends to put you on bottom when defended, prefer the family that preserves top advantage and keeps the conversion alive.
- Roll/inversion rule
  - Rolls are used to complete exposure or to land in stabilization lanes (ride/side body lock), not as movement for its own sake.
  - Do not roll without a plan to end in a control lane (attachment or pin).

### 14.6 Stabilization layers (how the system “resets without resetting”)
- Tight waist anchor
  - Used as the immediate conversion lane after failed backtakes and as the anchor against turtle attempts.
  - Primary function: stop scramble, deny re-guarding, force predictable follow-ups (back or pass).
- Underhook lane
  - Used to apply chest-to-chest pinning and pass.
  - Expected secondary function: as the opponent turns away to escape pressure, re-open chest-to-back access.
- Camping positions
  - Used to restrict rotation (force partial rotation rather than full re-square).
  - Designed outcomes:
    - accept-pin (turn toward) -> pass lane,
    - flee (turn away) -> back lane.
- Ride lanes (cross body ride)
  - Used to control rotation and prevent re-guarding during transitions.
  - Failure branch is explicit: if ride does not stick, convert directly into a guard pass rather than returning to loose entanglement.
- Side body lock
  - Used as a stabilization platform when roll/rotation is required.
  - Keeps the opponent pinned enough to run the pass/back dilemma from a stable base.
- North-south
  - Used as a forward-step reroute when direct attachment is blocked.
  - Maintains a stable pin while waiting for the opponent’s turning reactions to re-open either pass completion or back access.

### 14.7 Common “stall states” and immediate solutions
- Stall state: hooks denied and back attachment is slipping
  - Immediate solution: abandon hook chase; convert to tight waist or chest-to-chest pin and pass.
- Stall state: knee-down achieved but no forward progress
  - Immediate solution: re-check leg separation and posture; if Achilles constraint blocks posture, abandon pressure mode.
- Stall state: frame/post prevents forward advance
  - Immediate solution: clear cross-lat post; win shoulder-inside-elbow; then re-check shoulder rule.
- Stall state: 50/50 symmetry
  - Immediate solution: treat as separation/extraction first; trigger a stall breaker (half roll -> backstep or build to standing).


## 15.0 SUPPLEMENT (NOT TRANSCRIPT-DERIVED) (OPTIONAL)

### 15.1 How to use this BIO (operational playbook)
- Run this as a loop, not a checklist: entanglement/control -> force reaction -> choose lane -> stabilize -> finish as back or pass -> recycle.
- Define a “conversion done” standard:
  - Back: chest-to-upper-back connection + centre-line alignment before hook pursuit.
  - Pass: chest-to-chest pin with stable pressure (not “almost passed”).
- Pre-commit two automatic landing lanes so every failed backtake has a deterministic next action (archetypes: tight waist lane; underhook lane; north-south lane; ride/camping lane).
- Treat stabilization layers as intentional phases (camping/ride/north-south): stabilize first, then re-run pass/back dilemma rather than chasing in unstable space.
- Use “gate-first” rules in live training:
  - If foot safety is unresolved, do not commit to high-amplitude rotations/stand-ups.
  - If Achilles control is functionally constraining you, do not force pressure-forward or back-chasing; branch to a lane that does not require that freedom.
- Track a minimal KPI set to ensure you are improving conversion (not just collecting techniques):
  - % exchanges ending in back control or stabilized pass.
  - Time-to-branch after a clear reaction (turn away / turn toward / turtle / post).
  - % failed backtake attempts that convert to a stabilized pass lane (no reset).

### 15.2 Reliability micro-cues (non-step-by-step)
- Head line: if the head starts walking out and away during a come-up, stop advancement and re-close head-to-head before continuing.
- Hip containment: if hips drift outside your knees during back pursuit, stop hook-chasing and switch to pin/pass immediately.
- Shoulder-rule timing: re-check shoulder relationship after clearing frames; do not commit early if the post is still functioning.
- Pressure mode: if knee-down is not producing forward progress within 1–2 beats, you are missing separation/posture—rebuild, don’t grind.
- 50/50 symmetry: treat symmetry as a timer; if you are not separating/extracting, trigger a stall breaker (half roll/backstep or stand).

### 15.3 Troubleshooting matrix (symptom -> immediate response)
- “I’m behind them but can’t get hooks.”
  - Rebuild chest-to-upper-back and centre-line alignment; if denied, convert immediately to a pin lane (tight waist / chest-to-chest) and pass.
- “They keep turning into me when I chase the back.”
  - Accept chest-to-chest pins and pass-first; expect later turn-away to re-open the back.
- “They keep turning away when I try to pass.”
  - Attach to the back line; prioritize upper-back connection over chasing the pass into movement.
- “Cross-lat post blocks me.”
  - Clear the post first; win inside position (shoulder inside elbow); then re-check shoulder relationship and choose the lane.
- “Knee-down doesn’t move them.”
  - Rebuild separation + posture; if Achilles control persists, abandon pressure mode and re-solve the constraint.
- “50/50 becomes a stalemate.”
  - Trigger a stall breaker and re-enter separation/extraction; do not sit in symmetry.
- “Turtle kills my momentum.”
  - Anchor early; flatten and pass if hooks aren’t immediate; do not hover behind stable turtle.

### 15.4 Drilling games (simple scoring; high transfer)
- Game: Back-or-pass only
  - Start in a chosen entanglement or conversion moment.
  - Score only for: clean back control, or stabilized pass pin (hold for ~3 seconds).
  - Reset immediately on score.
- Game: No hook chase
  - Start from a near-back exposure position.
  - Defender: deny hooks and re-square.
  - Attacker: if hooks are denied, must convert to a pin/pass lane within a short count; scoring requires stabilized pass pin.
- Game: Reaction switch
  - Defender alternates reactions on cue: turn away / turn toward / turtle.
  - Attacker must branch correctly within 1–2 beats and finish into back or pass lane.
- Game: Frame-clearing gate
  - Start in an outside-ashi pressure context with defender posting cross-lat.
  - Attacker cannot advance until the post is cleared and inside position is won; score only after lane completion (back or stabilized pass).
- Game: 50/50 timer
  - Start in 50/50 symmetry.
  - If separation/extraction doesn’t happen inside a short window, attacker must trigger a stall breaker (half roll/backstep or stand); score only after back or stabilized pass.

### 15.5 Drilling progressions (skill ladders)
- Ladder A — Gates first
  - Round 1: foot safety only (partner hand-fishes; you maintain safety while angling).
  - Round 2: Achilles constraint awareness (partner holds Achilles; release on cue; you immediately branch into a pressure/conversion line).
  - Round 3: add reaction forks (turn away / turn toward / turtle / post) with immediate branch requirement.
- Ladder B — Inside position then shoulder rule
  - Round 1: elbow vs shoulder battle only (win shoulder inside elbow).
  - Round 2: add cross-lat post that must be cleared before advancing.
  - Round 3: after clearance, partner presents shoulder relationship; you must choose back vs pin correctly.
- Ladder C — Stabilize then finish
  - Round 1: enter stabilization only (camping / ride / north-south), no finishes.
  - Round 2: stabilization -> pass finish only.
  - Round 3: stabilization -> back finish only.
  - Round 4: full dilemma (finish pass or back based on reaction).

### 15.6 Training hygiene (leg entanglement focus)
- Set explicit tap norms for heel exposure and twisting pressure; treat early taps as correct training, not failure.
- Increase resistance on reactions (turning, posting, turtling) before increasing intensity on submission finish attempts.
- Cap inversion/roll intensity until you can reliably end in top lanes; prioritize “stay on top” as a learning constraint early.
- Use controlled entry starts for positional sparring (rather than scramble starts) to reduce injury risk and improve the learning signal.

### 15.7 Personalization prompts (to refine your own map)
- Pick your two highest-percentage “pass lanes” after failed backtakes and drill them as defaults until automatic.
- Pick your preferred stall breaker for 50/50 (half roll/backstep vs stand) and standardize it.
- Identify which reaction gives you the most trouble (turn toward / turn away / turtle / post) and bias 2–3 sessions toward that fork.
- Write a one-breath conversion checklist you can run mid-round: foot safe, Achilles not constraining, hips contained, head controlled, choose lane.
