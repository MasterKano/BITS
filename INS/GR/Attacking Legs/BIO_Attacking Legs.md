 0.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
========================

- System objective and organising principle
  - Build a lower-body submission system around leg-position asymmetry: attacker can access both of partner’s legs while keeping own legs comparatively safe.
  - Use leg entanglements (Ashi Garami families) as primary control hubs, not just finishing positions.

- Core positional families and hierarchy
  - Develop a clear hierarchy between Irimi Ashi, Outside Ashi, Cross/Inside Ashi, 50/50, Mutual Ashi, and associated variants (butterfly, shoelace, stretch, far-hip, backside 50/50).
  - Treat each Ashi family as a specialised tool: some better for initial control and heel exposure, others for switching sides, recapturing knees, or transitioning into stronger breaking positions.

- Control mechanics, wedges and double trouble
  - Emphasise strong leg wedges: knee line control, hip pinning, cross-shin and leg-scissor structures that deny back exposure and limit opponent’s mobility.
  - Prioritise “double trouble” (two-leg control) to restrict counters and secure heel exposure, especially when opponents attempt to clear primary leg or stand up.

- Submission hierarchy and strategic dilemmas
  - Use a submission hierarchy built around Achilles locks, toe holds, knee bars, and inside/outside heel hooks, with a constant bias toward stronger inside heel hooks where rules permit.
  - Create structured dilemmas (Achilles vs heel hook, toe hold vs heel hook, toe hold vs knee bar, sweep vs inversion) so that every defensive choice exposes a new breaking or transition opportunity.

- Positional battles and 50/50 / Mutual Ashi logic
  - Frame 50/50 and Mutual Ashi as contested zones where “going last”, leg-pummelling, inside-knee positioning, and waist-control variations decide who controls the breaking initiative.
  - Use separation mechanics (semi-sankaku opening, far-hip Ashi, backside 50/50 transitions) to break symmetry and return to favourable asymmetrical entanglements.

- Entry, follow-up and leg-switching behaviours
  - Treat Irimi Ashi as a primary entry and initial control hub from standing, seated, and top positions, with clear procedures for setting leg positions and denying back exposure.
  - Systematically “follow the leg” and “switch legs” when opponents roll, stiff-leg, or hide the primary heel, using structured transitions between Irimi, Outside, Cross, Inside, 50/50, backside and far-hip options.

- Defensive structure, escapes and shootouts
  - Map general escape directions and common counters (high leg, hand fights, knee posts, rolls) and pair them with pre-planned re-attacks or positional shifts.
  - Address leg-lock “shootouts” by using faster-onset options (especially toe holds) to force defensive reactions that open stronger breaking positions or knee-bar/heel-hook combinations.

- Stress testing, pressure and ruleset considerations
  - Integrate regular stress tests for each key configuration (Irimi, Outside, Cross Ashi, 50/50, Mutual Ashi) to confirm that control and finishing mechanics hold up under realistic resistance.
  - Adjust submission choices and exposure patterns to different rulesets and training contexts, balancing mechanical efficiency, breaking risk, and long-term leg health.

==============================
1.0 INSTRUCTIONAL VOLUME CONTENT
==============================

1.1 [Volume 1]: Leg Lock System Fundamentals & Global Strategy
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Establishes the overall leg lock framework: asymmetry between attackers’ and defenders’ legs, strategic roles of inside vs outside heel hooks, and the core battle between inside positions, Ashi families, 50/50, and Mutual Ashi.
- Introduces general escape directions, the double-trouble concept, leg-following and leg-switching behaviours, plus foundational drills and high-level breaking concepts for Achilles locks, knee bars, toe holds, and heel hooks.

1.2 [Volume 2]: Irimi Ashi Garami: Entries, Control & Outside Heel Hook Chains
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Details how to set and stress-test Irimi Ashi as a primary control hub, including basic Achilles attacks, counters to common extractions, and layered responses to forward pressure (post Ashi, belly-down Achilles, butterfly Ashi).
- Builds Achilles–heel hook dilemmas, transitions from butterfly Ashi into other entanglements, and links Irimi Ashi to outside Ashi with structured rolling, post-knee counters, figure-4 configurations, and refined breaking mechanics.

1.3 [Volume 3]: Outside Ashi Garami: Hip Control, Heel Exposure & Finishes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Compares Irimi vs outside Ashi, then focuses on solving high-leg defences (including toe hold options) while maintaining hip control and denying back exposure through leg-scissor and cross-shin structures.
- Systematically covers rolling behaviours and heel exposures (belly-down, post-Ashi, post-feet, cross-shin, kneeling opponent), reinforces the Achilles–heel hook dilemma, and connects outside Ashi attacks into Achilles finishes under defensive rolls and heel–knee bar combinations.

1.4 [Volume 4]: Toe Holds & Ushiro: Exposures, Dilemmas & Transitions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Explains toe hold exposures and finishing mechanics from belly-down and belly-up orientations, then uses toe holds to transition into heel hooks, recapture knees, and create calf-slicer and knee-bar options.
- Introduces top Ushiro entries from leg entanglements, including strategies for dealing with locked legs via double trouble, and structures toe hold–knee bar dilemmas and leg-spinning behaviours that reset control and expose new breaking lines.

1.5 [Volume 5]: Cross Ashi Garami: Double-Leg Control, Leg Lace & Backside 50/50 Entries
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Defines leg positions, structural problems, and base theory for cross Ashi, then develops leg pummelling patterns, figure-4 and reverse figure-4 Achilles attacks, and transitions from Achilles to heel hooks.
- Builds double-leg control through leg laces and ankle-control passing, exposes both heels, manages primary-leg escapes with stretch and shoelace Ashi, and uses Achilles-based control to mitigate back exposure and connect into backside 50/50, inside Ashi transitions, and rolling follow-ups.

1.6 [Volume 6]: 50/50 & Mutual Ashi: Dilemmas, Backside 50/50 & Far-Hip Transitions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Lays out 50/50 strategic logic around “attack until you’re defending”, inside-knee positioning, and separating semi-sankaku, then stacks toehold–separation and toehold–heel hook dilemmas with solutions to common hand-fight defences.
- Develops cross-waist 50/50, sweep/inversion dilemmas vs kneeling opponents, transitions into backside 50/50 and far-hip Ashi while following rolls, and concludes with Mutual Ashi concepts (going last, rolling through, gripping structures) that re-establish asymmetry and control.


====================
2.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
====================

2.1 System Goals, Asymmetry and Leg Safety
-----------------------------------------
- Primary objective
  - Build a leg lock system where the attacker consistently achieves leg-position asymmetry: easy access to opponent’s legs while keeping own legs comparatively insulated from counters.
  - Use Ashi Garami not as isolated “moves” but as control hubs from which to create dilemmas, transitions and submissions.

- Asymmetry vs symmetry
  - Asymmetrical positions (Irimi, Outside, Cross/Inside Ashi, backside 50/50, far-hip Ashi, Ushiro) give one player clear control of knee lines and hips.
  - Symmetrical positions (50/50, Mutual Ashi) are inherently more dangerous for both players; system goal is to “break symmetry” and return to favourable asymmetry whenever possible.

- Risk management and leg safety
  - Emphasis on knowing when to prioritise control over immediate breaking attempts, especially in positions where both players can attack (50/50, Mutual Ashi).
  - System encourages structured escape and re-attack cycles rather than wild “shootouts”; guard recovery, back-exposure prevention and knee-line awareness are built into each major configuration.

- Integration with overall game
  - Leg locks are not isolated from passing or back attacks; the system is designed so that failures and defences often lead to dominant positional outcomes (top Ushiro, back exposure, sweeping to top).
  - Clear pathways are provided for moving from leg entanglements into passing sequences, top control or back takes when submissions are not immediately available.


2.2 Major Ashi Garami Families and Hierarchy
--------------------------------------------
- Core families
  - Irimi Ashi Garami
    - Primary “entry hub” from many positions: easy to acquire, strong initial control of one leg, good for building Achilles–heel-hook dilemmas.
    - Often used as a staging point for transitions to outside Ashi, butterfly Ashi and other entanglements.
  - Outside Ashi Garami
    - Focused on strong hip control and back-exposure denial via leg scissoring and cross-shin structures.
    - Excels at methodical heel exposure and connecting Achilles threats to powerful outside-heel or heel–knee-bar combinations.
  - Cross / Inside Ashi Garami (including Cross Ashi, Shoelace, Stretch Ashi)
    - Strong double-leg control and multiple heel exposures; powerful offensive hub but with back-exposure and inversion risks if not managed correctly.
    - Used heavily to build dilemmas (Achilles vs heel hook) and to transition to backside 50/50 and inside Ashi when opponents roll or pummel legs.

- Symmetrical families
  - 50/50
    - Shared control over each other’s legs; initiative depends on inside-knee positioning, hand fighting and waist/hip control variants.
    - Treated as a “decision point” where the system aims to attack first and then separate into asymmetrical positions (backside 50/50, far-hip Ashi).
  - Mutual Ashi
    - Both players have entanglements on each other; requires disciplined leg-pummelling and timing (“going last”) to emerge with a clear attacking advantage.

- Secondary/derived positions
  - Butterfly Ashi, Post Ashi, Far-Hip Ashi
    - Transitional hubs used to manage forward-pressure reactions, post knees and rolling escapes.
  - Backside 50/50 and Double 50
    - Highly offensive variations with improved control of opponent’s hips and spine; often act as the final stepping stones to decisive breaking positions.
  - Ushiro (Top Ushiro)
    - Top control configuration derived from leg entanglements, offering strong heel exposure, toe holds and routes into back attacks.

- Hierarchical view
  - For attacking: move from accessible entries (Irimi / Outside / Cross Ashi) into tighter breaking hubs (backside 50/50, Ushiro, far-hip Ashi) as opponent’s reactions dictate.
  - For defending: prioritise escaping knee line, re-establishing inside position and converting dangerous symmetric positions back into safer guard or top scenarios.


2.3 Control, Retention and Transitions Between Ashi Variations
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Control principles
  - Knee-line dominance: consistently keep opponent’s knee past the line of the hips and aimed into strong wedges (thigh, ribs, hip).
  - Hip pinning and rotation: use leg scissoring, cross-shin frames and far-hip hooks to stop opponent turning their hips or exposing attacker’s back.
  - Upper–lower body integration: combine elbow position, hand fighting and cross-wrist grips with leg wedges to secure heel exposure and prevent opponent’s free leg from freeing the entanglement.

- Retention under common reactions
  - When opponent stands or posts:
    - Use post Ashi, far-hip Ashi and butterfly Ashi to follow hips, prevent clear knee-line extraction and create new heel-exposure angles.
  - When opponent rolls:
    - “Follow the leg” – maintain close chest-to-leg control, rotate with the roll and use it to transition to backside 50/50, inside Ashi or far-hip variations.
  - When opponent high-legs or tries to step over:
    - Use cross-shin and leg-pummelling counters (especially from outside Ashi) to re-trap the knee line and immediately re-establish heel exposure.

- Leg-following and leg-switching
  - Following a leg
    - Systematic practice of staying glued to the attacking leg during rolls and scrambles, preserving wedges and heel access.
  - Switching legs
    - When primary leg becomes too well defended, deliberately switch to the secondary leg via pre-defined pathways (Irimi → Outside, Outside → Cross Ashi, Cross Ashi → Inside / Backside 50/50).
    - Leg switches are paired with immediate dilemmas (new Achilles, toe hold or heel-hook threats) to exploit the momentary disorganisation in opponent’s defence.

- Positional cycling
  - Expected transition chains:
    - Irimi Ashi → Butterfly / Post Ashi → Outside Ashi → Cross / Inside Ashi → Backside 50/50 / Far-Hip Ashi / Ushiro.
    - 50/50 → Backside 50/50 or Far-Hip Ashi → Re-entry into Irimi/Outside/Cross Ashi or transition to top positions.
  - Each transition is taught with clear triggers (opponent posts, hides heel, high-legs, double-inverts, hand-fights successfully).


2.4 Submission Families and Breaking Priorities
-----------------------------------------------
- Main submission families
  - Achilles lock
    - Fast-onset, relatively low-risk option; used heavily to create dilemmas and to punish opponents who hang in “escaped” looking positions.
    - Frequently paired with heel hooks (Achilles–heel-hook dilemmas) and used to manage back-exposure threats.
  - Toe hold
    - Highly versatile and fast to apply; used from multiple Ashi configurations, especially when opponents attempt to free heels or rotate.
    - Core element of toe hold–heel-hook and toe hold–knee-bar dilemmas, and a key weapon in 50/50 and Ushiro transitions.
  - Knee bar
    - Typically arises from transitions out


====================
3.0 CORE CONCEPTS
====================

3.1 ASYMMETRICAL VS SYMMETRICAL LEG POSITIONS
--------------------------------------------

- Asymmetry as organising principle
  - Whole system built around creating leg-position asymmetry: attacker’s legs safe while opponent’s leg is exposed.
  - Preferred attacking hubs:
    - Outside ashi garami.
    - Cross ashi garami.
    - Inside ashi / “inside-out” ashi variants.
  - Goal: attacker has strong leg attacks while opponent has little or no meaningful access to attacker’s feet.

- Symmetrical positions (50/50 and mutual ashi)
  - 50/50:
    - Both players can attack the same class of heel hooks.
    - No inherent positional advantage: whoever understands the position better wins.
    - Good for holding spastic / explosive opponents:
      - Hard to get guard passed or back taken if knee is trapped.
      - But legs are highly exposed.
  - Mutual ashi:
    - Functional “50/50 of outside heel hooks”.
    - Both players can attack outside heel hooks; hard to hide the feet.
    - Typically a position you “end up in” (through pummelling errors) rather than one you voluntarily choose.

- Practical implications
  - Preference:
    - Use outside / cross / inside ashi as primary breaking hubs.
    - Use 50/50 and mutual ashi as transitional holding or shootout positions, not main homes.
  - In symmetric positions:
    - Knowledge advantage matters more than structure advantage.
  - In asymmetric positions:
    - Structural advantage (one-sided exposure) is baked in; opponent must escape before counterattacking.

3.2 ASHI GARAMI AS CONTROL ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------------------

- Ashi garami as foundation of leg control
  - Nothing happens until a leg is controlled through a robust ashi configuration.
  - Key families (baseline progression):
    - Irimi ashi (initial entry / default control).
    - Outside ashi (primary outside heel hook hub).
    - Cross ashi (dominant inverted heel hook hub).
    - Inside ashi (cross-ashi-like, but set for outside heel hook).
    - 50/50 (inverted heel hooks for both).
    - Mutual ashi (outside heel hooks for both).

- Connection and wedging principles
  - Maintain multiple connection points:
    - Hips close to opponent’s hips.
    - Heel and knee squeezed together.
    - Active control of far leg when possible.
  - Ashi should do the wedging, not just the upper-body grip:
    - Stress-test without Achilles grip to verify leg configuration is structurally sound.
    - Achilles grip is an add-on wedge and control tool, not the primary structure.

- Following the leg through transitions
  - Opponent reactions will force rolls and direction changes:
    - Opponent may roll two, three, six times trying to free the leg.
  - Requirement:
    - Stay attached with the ashi itself (and/or Achilles grip).
    - Follow the leg through the roll and emerge in a secure breaking position (often on the other side).
  - Transitions between ashi families:
    - Irimi → outside.
    - Outside → cross.
    - Cross → inside.
    - Any ashi ↔ 50/50 or mutual, depending on opponent’s rolls and pummels.

3.3 DOUBLE TROUBLE AND TWO-LEG CONTROL
--------------------------------------

- “Two is always better than one”
  - Whenever possible, control two of the opponent’s legs rather than one.
  - Benefits:
    - Greatly restricts opponent’s ability to stand, heist, or rotate.
    - Makes defensive rolls and leg pummels much harder.
    - Provides strong control when setting up knee bars, toe holds, and transitions.

- Typical double-trouble configurations
  - Cross ashi:
    - Primary leg: heel hook / inverted heel hook hub.
    - Secondary leg: controlled for Achilles, reverse figure-four Achilles, leg lace, or simply to deny defensive rotation.
  - Tapo shiro (rear-facing top ashi) into double trouble:
    - Opponent crosses or figure-fours ankles to “hide” feet.
    - Attacker falls across body, figure-fours legs below opponent’s, and traps both legs.
    - Bodyweight pins one leg; ashi controls the other.

- Role in knee bar and shootout scenarios
  - Knee bars:
    - Pure single-leg knee bars (with no secondary-leg control) are easier to escape for skilled opponents.
    - Double trouble or heel-knee-bar structures constrain spin directions and make escapes difficult.
  - Mutual ashi / shootouts:
    - Double-trouble-style transitions allow attacker to move from mutual shootouts into dominant structures (cross ashi, far-hip ashi, knee bar dilemmas).

3.4 LEG PUMMELLING, STRESS TESTS, AND ESCAPE DIRECTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------

- Four major defensive directions opponent can pursue
  - From ashi positions, opponent typically:
    - Moves straight back to clear the knee from the knee line.
    - Drives forward to crush and gain upper-body control.
    - Rotates / turns left or right (rolling, high-legging, changing hips).
    - Re-pummels legs to enter their own ashi or passing attacks.
  - System requirement:
    - Clear responses to each direction from each core ashi configuration.

- Irimi ashi stress tests
  - After setting irimi ashi, run stress tests before committing to submissions:
    - Backward extraction:
      - Opponent walks away / scoots back to pull knee line out.
      - Answer: keep hips close, knees pinched, and strong heel–knee connection so she drags you with her.
    - Belly-down roll:
      - Opponent rolls onto stomach to free leg.
      - Answer: back-heel, pinch knees, draw knees to chest to stop knee rising toward ceiling.
    - Forward pressure:
      - Opponent tries to come up and crush chest/head.
      - Answer: active control of far leg and slight hip lift so partner cannot generate forward base.
    - Re-pummelling:
      - If your leg “floats”, opponent re-pummels inside and takes over leg attacks.
      - Answer: proactive far-leg control; keep foot/leg positions that block easy re-pummels.

- Leg pummelling battles
  - Losing the pummel:
    - Example: starting in irimi ashi, opponent pummels into a mutual ashi via inside leg threading.
    - Often arises from leaving a leg behind or getting beat on a pummel, not from deliberate choice.
  - Offensive pummelling:
    - Use re-pummels to:
      - Move from 50/50 to outside ashi.
      - Transfer from cross ashi to inside ashi when opponent turns to “correct” hip.
      - Reclaim far-hip ashi or cross ashi when opponent tries to re-attack.

3.5 BREAKING MECHANICS AND SUBMISSION HIERARCHY
-----------------------------------------------

- Achilles locks
  - Control function:
    - Even without ideal ashi, a strong Achilles grip can control the opponent long enough to re-pummel and reset legs.
  - Key ideas:
    - Grips that keep hands high (figure-four, wrist-to-wrist, etc.).
    - Hips close to opponent’s hips; control at end of lever (near opponent’s heel/Achilles).
    - Can be used belly-up or belly-down, including transitions from far-hip ashi, tapo shiro, and 50/50.
  - Strategic usage:
    - As a “safety handle” when leg configuration feels compromised.
    - As a finishing option when opponent’s re-pummels are blocked and knee line is fully controlled.

- Toe holds
  - Speed vs strength:
    - Toe holds come on faster because hands alone create the lock.
    - Mechanical breaking power is lower than heel hooks, which connect leg to full torso.
  - Coupled-force requirement:
    - Effective pressure requires toes driven toward butt while heel is drawn toward chin.
    - Single-direction pulling (only toes down or only heel up) creates little danger.
  - Dilemma usage:
    - Use toe holds to force reactions in shootouts (e.g. mutual ashi, 50/50, outside ashi):
      - If opponent stubbornly keeps figure-four, cannot roll defensively and risks catastrophic break.
      - If opponent unlocks or shifts to semi-sankaku, legs separate and heel-exposure or leg-pass options open.
    - Toe-hold → heel-hook chains:
      - Threaten toe hold to get reaction, then switch to heel hook, knee bar, or cross-ashi transitions.

- Heel hooks
  - Inside vs outside:
    - Inside (inverted) heel hooks:
      - Mechanically stronger.
      - You can make more technical errors and still get a strong break.
    - Outside heel hooks:
      - Require more details to achieve catastrophic breaks on skilled opponents.
      - Still essential, especially from outside-ashi-based systems.
  - Common mechanics:
    - Same coupled forces concept as toe holds:
      - Toes directed down, heel drawn up to chest/chin.
    - Strong control over knee line:
      - Knees splayed and hips driven forward for maximal torque.
  - Strategic preference:
    - When both options are available, choose inside heel hook first.
    - Maintain ability to break effectively from both inside and outside positions.

- Knee bars
  - Hierarchy of control and options:
    - Best case: double trouble knee bar with both legs controlled.
    - Next: lat knee bar with the leg draped across torso, calf wedged to shoulder, elbow tight.
    - Additional tool: heel knee bar (heel hook grip with knee-bar hip mechanics) to limit escape directions.
  - Lat knee bar:
    - Attacker’s shoulder behind Achilles/ankle; forearm wedged along calf.
    - Strong friction and tension through opponent’s leg, making rotations easy to follow and finish.
  - Heel knee bar:
    - Uses heel-hook grip while hips drive through for knee-bar style break.
    - Limits opponent’s ability to spin freely; forces them into predictable escape direction.
  - Avoided baseline:
    - Pure “one-leg” knee bar where only heel/Achilles is controlled and second leg is free:
      - Works on less experienced opponents but unreliable against skilled defenders.

3.6 DILEMMAS AND SUBMISSION CHAINING
------------------------------------

- Achilles vs heel-hook dilemmas
  - From ashi positions (irimi / outside / cross / inside):
    - Use Achilles grip to stabilise control when ashi is under attack.
    - Opponent’s attempts to free knee or re-pummel expose heel; immediate switch to heel hook.
  - Defensive rolls:
    - As opponent rolls to relieve heel-hook pressure, follow the leg and be ready to:
      - Re-attach with Achilles if heel slip occurs.
      - Re-expose heel from the new side (often outside ashi after roll).

- Toe hold vs knee bar dilemmas
  - From double trouble / tapo shiro:
    - Legs crossed or figure-four:
      - Initial threat is toe hold on trapped leg.
      - If opponent does not react, broken on toe hold.
      - If opponent pushes on hands or unlocks, attacker catches foot, re-positions, and can switch to knee bar.
  - Lat / heel-knee-bar integration:
    - If double trouble cannot be fully secured:
      - Shift to lat knee bar for stronger mechanical control.
      - Or transition to heel knee bar to constrain spin and retain breaking leverage.

- Toe hold vs heel-hook dilemmas
  - Mutual ashi / 50/50 shootouts:
    - Toe hold generates pain and reaction faster; used to force defensive roll.
    - As opponent rolls, transition to:
      - Cross ashi with inverted heel hook.
      - Outside ashi with outside heel hook.
      - Knee bar variations depending on leg configuration.
  - Semi-sankaku transitions:
    - If opponent extends legs to escape toe hold:
      - Attacker uses opened structure to separate legs, expose heel, or pass to another ashi.

3.7 STRATEGIC ROLES OF MAIN ASHI FAMILIES
-----------------------------------------

- Irimi ashi
  - Most common and accessible initial entry:
    - Available from standing, top, bottom, seated, and various guards.
  - Primary roles:
    - First robust control over both hips and often both legs.
    - High-quality heel exposure hub that often transitions into outside ashi for finishing.

- Outside ashi
  - Primary outside-heel-hook breaking hub.
  - Strengths:
    - Asymmetrical: strong attacks with limited counters if leg configuration is correct.
    - Integrates well with:
      - Far-hip ashi for extra foot safety and opponent-hip control.
      - Tapo shiro transitions (e.g. standing or kneeling opponents).

- Cross ashi
  - Most dominant “inverted” heel-hook hub in the system.
  - Features:
    - Strong breaking mechanics.
    - Easy integration of double trouble on secondary leg.
  - Management:
    - Against strong opponents who are hard to heel-expose, may require transitions to inside ashi or far-hip ashi as they rotate.

- Inside ashi
  - Cross-ashi-like control with outside-heel-hook finishing orientation.
  - Use-cases:
    - When opponent turns to “correct” hip during cross-ashi defence.
    - To punish high-level heel-slip attempts, using inside feet positioning to keep heel exposed.

- 50/50
  - Use as:
    - Control position for explosive opponents (hard to pass/back-take when knee is trapped).
    - Transitional hub for:
      - Following rolls and then transferring to outside ashi or far-hip ashi.
      - Heel-hook attacks when legs are separated and appropriate grips are set.
  - Strategic rule:
    - “Attack until you’re defending”:
      - Always be first to separate legs, attack heel, or transition to superior ashi.
      - Only switch to defence when opponent actually secures credible threats.

- Mutual ashi
  - Role:
    - Outcome of pummelling errors or leaving a leg behind, not a target position.
    - Used mainly as a transient shootout environment.
  - Key concept – “going last”:
    - The player who exposes heel first without appropriate protection often gets heel-hooked.
    - Priority:
      - Hide own heels (e.g. far-hip ashi options).
      - Use dilemmas (toe holds, double trouble, transitions) to force opponent to show their heel first.

3.8 RULESET, SAFETY, AND TRAINING CONSTRAINTS
---------------------------------------------

- Ruleset-driven attack selection
  - Certain rule environments restrict heel hooks but allow toe holds and straight ankle locks.
  - Adjustments:
    - In contexts where heel hooks are illegal:
      - Emphasise toe holds and Achilles locks from positions where heel hooks would normally be primary.
      - Use the same structural exposure mechanics but finish with legal submissions.

- Safety and escalation
  - Heel hooks:
    - Highest catastrophic break potential; pressure may build more slowly but total damage is greater.
    - Should be applied with controlled, progressive tension in training.
  - Toe holds:
    - Pain comes on very quickly; used tactically to provoke movement or as fast-breaking options in competition.
  - Training implication:
    - Partners must tap early on rotational submissions.
    - System relies on tight control; technical success should be prioritised over maximal speed in practice.

4.1 [VOLUME 1]: LEG LOCK SYSTEM FUNDAMENTALS & GLOBAL STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------

Introductory theory and global leg lock structure
- Intro to leg locks / overview / theory
  - Leg lock system framed around exploiting the historical weakness in lower-body understanding relative to upper body.
  - Core organising idea: build a persistent asymmetry in leg positions so one player can attack while remaining comparatively safe.
  - Emphasis on using leg entanglements as primary control positions that can lead to dominant pins or back exposure if submissions fail.
- Importance of inside and outside heel hooks
  - Inside heel hooks prioritised for mechanical strength and forgiveness of minor errors.
  - Outside heel hooks still important but require tighter details for catastrophic breaks on skilled opponents.
  - Preference hierarchy:
    - When both are available, choose inside heel hook.
    - Maintain ability to finish from both inside and outside orientations.
- Battle of inside positions
  - Fight to maintain or win inside leg position in pummelling exchanges.
  - Inside position dictates who can enter Ashi Garami first and whose feet are more exposed.
  - Losing inside position leads quickly to symmetric shootouts (50/50, mutual ashi) rather than clean, asymmetrical attacks.

Global Ashi Garami strategy by family
- Irimi and outside Ashi Garami strategy
  - Irimi used as the most common initial entry: accessible from standing, top, bottom and seated positions.
  - From Irimi, focus on:
    - Controlling both hips and at least one of the opponent’s legs.
    - Denying back exposure by orienting knees and hips to prevent opponent turning behind.
    - Using early heel exposure to transition into outside ashi for more decisive finishes.
  - Outside ashi emphasised as a primary asymmetrical breaking hub with strong back-exposure denial.
- Cross and inside Ashi Garami strategy
  - Cross ashi used as a powerful inverted-heel-hook hub with strong double-leg control.
  - Main issues addressed:
    - Managing risk of back exposure if control is loose.
    - Ensuring consistent knee-line dominance while transitioning between primary and secondary legs.
  - Inside ashi treated as a structurally similar configuration oriented toward outside heel hooks.
- 50/50 strategy
  - Treated as a symmetric position:
    - Both players can attack each other’s legs with similar options.
  - Strategic rule:
    - Play “attack until you’re defending” – be first to separate legs, expose heels, and move back to asymmetry.
  - Used as a holding and transition zone rather than a preferred finishing hub.
- Mutual Ashi Garami strategy
  - Viewed as a “50/50 of outside heel hooks” – both players have strong outside-heel access.
  - Usually entered by losing pummelling or leaving a leg behind rather than deliberate choice.
  - Goal is to:
    - Protect one’s own heels first.
    - Use dilemmas to force the opponent to expose their heel before committing.

Defensive structure, escapes and leg-following behaviour
- General escape directions
  - Opponent’s primary defensive routes identified as:
    - Retreating to clear knee line.
    - Driving forward to crush upper body.
    - Rotating left/right through rolls and hip turns.
    - Re-pummelling legs to enter their own Ashi or passing game.
  - For each direction, system requires a default counter:
    - Retain knee line.
    - Re-orient hips.
    - Follow rolls (“follow the leg”).
    - Re-pummel back into advantageous Ashi.
- Double trouble
  - Principle: whenever possible, control two of the opponent’s legs rather than one.
  - Double trouble used to:
    - Limit defensive rotations and standing attempts.
    - Stabilise heel-exposure positions.
    - Link toe holds, knee bars, and heel hooks into chained attacks.
- Following and switching legs
  - Following a leg:
    - Maintain close, glued connection during opponent’s rolls and pivots.
    - Aim to emerge in an equal-or-better Ashi on the same leg at the end of each scramble.
  - Switching legs:
    - When primary leg defence becomes too tight or knee line approaches safety, transition to the other leg.
    - Leg switches are paired with immediate submission threats to exploit defensive disorganisation.

Fundamental drills and base mechanics
- Basic drills
  - Movement patterns for entering Ashi, hip mobility, and leg pummelling.
  - Rehearsal of correct hip and knee alignment in Irimi and outside ashi without submissions.
- Achilles lock drill
  - Reps focused on:
    - Achieving high, tight hand position on Achilles.
    - Connecting hips to opponent’s hips rather than pulling only with arms.
    - Feeling the effect of small angle and hip adjustments on pressure.
- Cowboy drill
  - Rolling-through-style leg entanglement drill:
    - Practitioner “rides” opponent’s leg through rolls while keeping Ashi closed.
    - Reinforces habit of following the leg and maintaining knee-line control.

Submission concept clusters
- Achilles lock concepts
  - Treated both as a finishing hold and as a control grip for transitions.
  - Emphasis on:
    - Using hips as the primary driving force.
    - Adjusting elbow and wrist position to prevent heel slips.
- Knee bar concepts
  - Preference for structures with clear hip-line control and limited spin options for the opponent.
  - Comparison between simple straight knee bars and more constrained variations that integrate heel or lat control.
- Toe hold concepts
  - Coupled-force principle:
    - Toes driven toward glute while heel is drawn toward chest for effective torque.
  - Used to create dilemmas that force defensive movement, opening heel hooks or knee bars.
- Heel hook concepts
  - Reinforces mechanical distinctions between inside and outside heel hooks.
  - Focus on:
    - Knee-line retention.
    - Strong rotational wedge from hips through core into the opponent’s lower leg.
    - Preference for inside variants when rules allow.

4.2 [VOLUME 2]: IRIMI ASHI GARAMI – ENTRIES, CONTROL & OUTSIDE HEEL HOOK CHAINS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Irimi Ashi Garami entry and leg-setting
- Intro to Irimi Ashi Garami
  - Identified as the most common first entanglement when entering the legs from various positions.
  - Used to:
    - Control both hips.
    - Restrict forward pressure.
    - Open heel-exposure angles that feed outside ashi.
- Setting an Irimi Ashi Garami
  - Leg configuration goals:
    - Hips close to opponent’s hips.
    - Knees pinched with the primary leg trapped securely.
    - Far leg monitored and controlled to prevent easy standing or pummelling.
  - Hand placement:
    - Initial control at ankle and knee to guide the leg into Ashi without muscling.

Stress testing and basic Achilles application
- Stress test (Irimi Ashi)
  - Check that:
    - Opponent cannot easily limp-leg or slide knee line free by scooting back.
    - Forward pressure does not collapse structure or expose back.
    - Rotations do not immediately unwind the entanglement.
- Basic Achilles lock from Irimi
  - Emphasis on:
    - Achieving tight Achilles bite while maintaining knee-line control.
    - Integrating far-leg control rather than sacrificing it for raw squeezing.

Counters to extraction and forward pressure
- Countering a basic extraction
  - When opponent tries to pull leg straight back:
    - Hips follow and close gap.
    - Knees pinch and line of force is redirected into the hip wedge.
- Countering forward pressure with Irimi Ashi and elbow position
  - Use elbow and forearm frames to prevent chest/head crush.
  - Direct pressure into Ashi wedges so forward drive reinforces control rather than breaking it.
- Countering forward pressure with post Ashi
  - When opponent posts and attempts to stand:
    - Transition to post ashi:
      - Re-angle hips.
      - Use posted leg as an additional wedge.
    - Guide opponent into compromised balance for entries or sweeps.
- Countering forward pressure with belly-down Achilles
  - Spin underneath or to the side to reach belly-down configuration.
  - Use gravity and hip extension to increase Achilles pressure while maintaining leg control.

Butterfly Ashi transitions and follow-ups
- Switching to butterfly Ashi
  - From Irimi:
    - Re-thread legs to achieve butterfly-style hooks.
    - Maintain knee-line control while improving mobility and angle options.
- Butterfly Ashi to other leg entanglements
  - Routes include:
    - Back to Irimi for renewed control.
    - Outside ashi via leg rotation.
    - Inside or cross ashi when opponent attempts to turn or invert.

Achilles–heel hook dilemmas and finishing mechanics
- Achilles–heel hook dilemma
  - From Irimi or butterfly:
    - Threaten Achilles to fix opponent in place.
    - As opponent reacts to relieve ankle pressure, expose heel and transition to heel hook.
- Finishing mechanics
  - Details for:
    - Tight elbow position and chest connection.
    - Coordinating hip extension with rotational control of the knee.
  - Application under realistic defensive movement, not static holds.

Heel-slip counters and outside Ashi transitions
- Stress test and heel-slip responses
  - Additional stress test focused on heel integrity:
    - If heel begins to slip, shift to:
      - High-hands configuration.
      - Or roll-through to re-expose heel.
- Countering a heel slip with high hands
  - Raise grip higher along Achilles and calf.
  - Draw opponent’s foot deeper under armpit to re-trap heel.
- Countering a heel slip with a roll through
  - Roll in direction of escape to:
    - Follow foot.
    - Land in a new ashi configuration (often outside ashi).
- Switching to outside Ashi and single roll theory
  - Use the roll and pummelling to arrive in outside ashi with heel already exposed.
  - “Single roll theory”:
    - Minimising uncontrolled, multiple rolls.
    - Using one deliberate roll to reach a stable, high-percentage breaking hub.

Post-knee counters, figure-4 switches and breaking mechanics
- Countering a post knee
  - When opponent drives knee into mat to free leg:
    - Use the post as a lever to rotate into outside ashi or cross-leg configurations.
- Figure-4 switch if opponent refuses to roll
  - If opponent resists rotational escape:
    - Lock figure-4 legs around the trapped limb.
    - Increase control torque, forcing decision between staying put and suffering break or initiating roll under worse terms.
- Breaking mechanics and outside Ashi breaking mechanics
  - Clarification of:
    - Foot positioning, knee angle and hip line for efficient torque.
    - Differences in finishing cues between Irimi-based and outside-ashi-based heel hooks and Achilles locks.

4.3 [VOLUME 3]: OUTSIDE ASHI GARAMI – HIP CONTROL, HEEL EXPOSURE & FINISHES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outside Ashi structure and comparison to Irimi
- Intro to outside Ashi
  - Defined as an asymmetrical entanglement with strong offensive potential and limited counters when executed correctly.
- Irimi vs outside Ashi Garami
  - Irimi:
    - Easier to acquire.
    - Excellent for initial control and heel exposure.
  - Outside ashi:
    - Superior for:
      - Back-exposure denial.
      - Stable finishing.
    - Often the targeted hub after successful Irimi entries.

Defensive high-leg responses and toe holds
- Countering a high leg
  - When opponent raises leg high to free knee or turn out:
    - Adjust hip angle and leg scissoring to re-trap leg.
    - Prevent foot from stepping over into safer positions.
- Countering a high leg with wrist-to-wrist toe hold
  - Use wrist-to-wrist grip on foot to:
    - Create quick toe-hold threat while leg is elevated.
    - Force lowering or rotational defence that opens heel exposure.

Hip control, back-exposure denial and leg-scissoring structures
- Controlling outside Ashi and denying back exposure
  - Use:
    - Leg scissoring around thigh and hip.
    - Tight knee pinch.
    - Proper hip orientation (facing hips, not turning away).
  - Aim is to:
    - Keep spine aligned to opponent’s hip line.
    - Prevent opponent from getting behind the torso.
- Controlling hips by leg scissoring
  - One leg above and one below opponent’s trapped leg to create a clamp.
  - Clamp controls hip rotation and limits their ability to sit up or turn.
- Controlling hips with a cross shin
  - Cross shin placed across opponent’s waist or hip line.
  - Secondary control over far hip and counter to high-leg attempts.

Rolling mechanics and heel exposure patterns
- Forward roll
  - Used when:
    - Opponent rolls to relieve heel-hook pressure.
    - Attacker must follow to maintain wedge.
  - Key idea:
    - Stay glued to heel and knee during roll.
    - Emerge with new heel-exposure angle, often belly-down.
- Belly-down heel exposure
  - Pivot to belly-down to:
    - Amplify rotational force.
    - Use bodyweight more directly on knee and ankle.
- Post-Ashi heel exposure
  - When opponent posts leg or foot:
    - Convert post into wedge that pins hips.
    - Use post as anchor to turn heel toward chest.
- Post-feet and cross-shin heel exposure
  - Use posted feet and cross-shin frames to:
    - Split opponent’s base.
    - Drive heel into locked orientation while restricting rolls.

Stress tests, heel-slip counters and kneeling-opponent scenarios
- Stress test (outside Ashi)
  - Confirm:
    - Knee line cannot be easily slid out when opponent drives or retreats.
    - Rolls do not strip leg scissoring.
    - High-leg attempts are re-captured by cross-shin work.
- Countering a heel slip with a roll
  - If heel begins to slip out of control:
    - Roll in direction of escape.
    - Re-catch heel in new belly-down or side-facing configuration.
- Heel exposure on a kneeling opponent
  - When opponent drops to knees:
    - Use leg scissoring and hip angle to keep them from turning fully away.
    - Create heel exposure by rotating their foot outward while hips remain fixed.

Achilles/heel-hook dilemmas and finishing sequences
- Reiterating Achilles/heel hook dilemma
  - Achilles used to “hold” opponent in compromised posture.
  - Heel hook applied once heel is clearly exposed and knee line is secured.
- Achilles – Irimi Ashi vs outside Ashi
  - Distinctions in:
    - Where hips are placed relative to opponent’s hips.
    - How secondary leg control is integrated.
- Finishing Achilles lock vs defensive roll
  - When opponent rolls proactively:
    - Use roll to tighten Achilles line.
    - Finish as they complete roll rather than resetting.
- Heel–knee bar integration
  - Combine heel control and knee-bar-style hip extension:
    - Limits spin.
    - Offers alternative breaking path if heel slips.

4.4 [VOLUME 4]: TOE HOLDS & USHIRO – EXPOSURES, DILEMMAS & TRANSITIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Toe hold exposures and finishing mechanics
- Intro to toe holds
  - Toe holds presented as:
    - Fast-onset submissions.
    - Key tools for forcing movement in leg-lock shootouts.
- Belly-down exposure
  - Positioning to:
    - Trap opponent’s leg under bodyweight.
    - Turn toes toward glutes while controlling heel angle.
- Belly-up exposure
  - Finishing from supine orientation:
    - Use core rotation and hip extension instead of gravity.
- Belly-down finishing mechanics
  - Sequence:
    - Lock grip.
    - Anchor elbow and shoulder against mat.
    - Use hips and torso twist to apply rotational force.
- Belly-up finishing mechanics
  - Emphasis on:
    - Coordinating arm pull with hip bridge.
    - Maintaining strict control of knee line to avoid wild twisting.

Toe-hold–driven transitions and knee recapture
- Toe hold to heel hook
  - Use toe hold to:
    - Force opponent to roll or re-orient foot.
    - Transition immediately to heel hook once heel is exposed in safer orientation.
- Recapturing a knee
  - When opponent’s knee begins to clear the line:
    - Toe hold threats force them to halt extraction or re-bend leg.
    - Re-thread Ashi to put knee back deep into hip line.

Calf-slicer switch and top Ushiro entries
- Calf slice switch
  - If opponent bends leg aggressively during toe-hold defence:
    - Transition shins and hips to create calf-slicer wedge behind knee.
    - Use as either finishing hold or to break posture and re-entangle.
- Intro to top Ushiro
  - Top Ushiro defined as:
    - Rear-facing top entanglement with strong heel/toe-hold access.
- Moving to top Ushiro
  - From bottom Ashi:
    - Use leg pummelling and sweeps to come on top.
    - Maintain leg control so entanglement is preserved as posture changes.

Heel/toe-hold exposures, double trouble and shootout management
- Heel hook and toe hold exposure from top Ushiro
  - Use top position to:
    - Pin hips.
    - Open multiple submission lines on trapped leg.
- Double trouble to counter locked legs
  - When opponent crosses or locks legs:
    - Enter double trouble configuration.
    - Peel or split lock with hips and second leg.
- Toe-hold–knee-bar dilemma
  - Construct scenario where:
    - Toe hold threatens immediate damage.
    - If opponent straightens leg or turns, transition into knee bar.

Spinning the leg and re-setting control
- Spinning the leg
  - Controlled leg spins used to:
    - Unravel stubborn defensive structures (crossed ankles, tight clamps).
    - Reset into dominant Ashi or Ushiro positions.
  - Maintain knee-line control throughout spin; never sacrifice control just to move.

4.5 [VOLUME 5]: CROSS ASHI GARAMI – DOUBLE-LEG CONTROL, LEG LACE & BACKSIDE 50/50 ENTRIES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cross Ashi structure, issues and basic theory
- Intro to cross Ashi
  - Defines leg positions for cross Ashi:
    - Both legs controlling opponent’s trapped limb from cross orientation.
- Leg positions and main issues
  - Key concerns:
    - Preventing opponent from turning and exposing the back.
    - Managing forced inversions and double-rolling scenarios.
- Basic theory
  - Cross Ashi treated as:
    - High-power inverted heel-hook hub.
    - Strong double-trouble environment if secondary leg is also captured.

Leg pummelling and Achilles-based attacks
- Basic leg pummelling
  - Step-by-step pummelling between:
    - Standard cross Ashi.
    - Shoelace-style positions.
    - Stretch Ashi variations.
- Figure-4 Achilles and reverse figure-4 Achilles
  - Standard figure-4:
    - Classic Achilles configuration with heel tucked deep.
  - Reverse figure-4:
    - Variation that alters direction of pressure and counter-rotation.
- Achilles to heel-hook conversions
  - Start with Achilles:
    - Force defensive reaction.
    - As opponent turns, transition to inverted heel hook or outside heel hook depending on leg orientation.

Leg-lace control, passing options and double-Dracula structures
- Leg lace
  - Use of crossing leg control on both of opponent’s legs:
    - Strongly constrains their ability to pummel or stand.
- Leg lace to heel hook
  - Once legs are laced:
    - Free hands to hunt heel.
    - Maintain lace to block rotations during finishing.
- Passing a leg – 2-on-1 ankle and half-Dracula to heel hook
  - 2-on-1 ankle:
    - Use two hands to dominate one ankle, feeding into heel exposure.
  - Half-Dracula grip:
    - Forearm and shoulder wrapping configuration that:
      - Controls upper part of lower leg.
      - Directly feeds heel hook entry.
- Passing a leg – double-Dracula and exposing both heels
  - Double-Dracula:
    - Both forearms used in Dracula-like wraps.
    - Enables exposure of both heels for multiple attack lines.

Managing primary-leg escapes and secondary-heel captures
- Countering primary leg escape with stretch Ashi
  - If primary leg starts to slip:
    - Extend legs into stretch Ashi to re-engage knee line.
- Catching the heel without the secondary leg
  - When second leg cannot be fully captured:
    - Adjust torso, hips and elbow grip to control heel with single-leg focus.
- Catching the heel from shoelace Ashi
  - In shoelace variations:
    - Use top-leg pressure and shin positioning to turn foot.
    - Free hands for heel control without losing knee line.

Heist dilemmas, back-exposure mitigation and forced double inversion
- Using a heisting dilemma from shoelace Ashi
  - Create choice:
    - If opponent heists up, base is compromised and heel is accessible.
    - If opponent refuses, remains pinned and vulnerable to continued attacks.
- Using an Achilles to mitigate back exposure
  - When cross Ashi threatens to expose back:
    - Tighten Achilles control.
    - Re-orient hips and legs to keep chest facing opponent.
- Countering a forced double inversion
  - When opponent forces both players into double inversion:
    - Maintain heel capture and knee-line alignment.
    - Use inversion to transition into backside 50/50 or inside Ashi rather than losing position.

Backside 50/50 connections and late-stage transitions
- Achilles grip to backside 50/50
  - From cross Ashi:
    - Use strong Achilles grip to guide leg through rotation.
    - Land in backside 50/50 with heel already framed for attack.
- When all fails, centre chest
  - Reset rule:
    - If entanglement becomes disorganised or leg positions unclear:
      - Re-centre chest toward opponent’s hips.
      - Re-establish simple Ashi before re-attacking.
- Forward shift to heel hook
  - Shift hips forward across opponent’s hip line to:
    - Tighten knee-line capture.
    - Improve leverage for inverted heel hooks.
- Far-hip Ashi to stop a roll and transfer to inside Ashi
  - As opponent rolls or turns:
    - Hook far hip to halt spin.
    - Transition from cross to inside Ashi as they attempt to “correct” orientation.
- Following a roll
  - Maintain chest-to-leg contact through rolls.
  - Aim to emerge in:
    - Backside 50/50.
    - Inside Ashi.
    - Or a renewed cross Ashi with improved heel exposure.

4.6 [VOLUME 6]: 50/50 & MUTUAL ASHI – DILEMMAS, BACKSIDE 50/50 & FAR-HIP TRANSITIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

50/50 theory and baseline configurations
- Intro to 50/50
  - Described as:
    - Non-asymmetrical position where both players can attack legs.
    - Useful for control but inherently high-risk for both sides’ feet.
- “Attack until you’re defending”
  - Rule:
    - Assume offensive role until opponent presents a credible attack that must be defended.
  - Offence involves:
    - Separating opponent’s feet.
    - Exposing heel.
    - Transitioning out of symmetric entanglement into asymmetry.
- Inside knee position
  - Inside knee positioning used to:
    - Tilt initiative toward one player.
    - Make their heel attacks arrive earlier and with better alignment.

Semi-sankaku separation and toe-hold dilemmas
- Separating a semi-sankaku
  - When opponent forms semi-sankaku-style configuration:
    - Use leg and hip movements to pry legs apart.
    - Open path for heel exposure or leg passing.
- Toe-hold / separation dilemma
  - Toe holds used to:
    - Force opponent to unlock defensive semi-sankaku or leg-cross.
    - If they hang on, risk immediate break.
- Toe-hold / heel-hook dilemma
  - Once legs separate:
    - Threaten toe hold to provoke rotation.
    - As foot rotates and heel becomes available, switch to heel hook.

Hand-fight counters and cross-waist 50/50
- Countering the hand fight
  - When opponent attacks primary control grips:
    - Re-pummel hands higher on leg.
    - Use elbow and torso frames to protect own heel while attacking theirs.
- Cross-waist 50/50
  - Variation where:
    - Additional control is taken around waist or torso.
    - This reduces opponent’s ability to sit up, turn or counter-attack.
  - Allows smoother transitions into sweeps or heel hooks.

Sweep / inversion dilemmas vs kneeling opponents
- Sweep/inversion dilemma vs kneeling opponent
  - From 50/50 against a kneeling base:
    - Construct choice:
      - If opponent bases heavily, angle into sweep.
      - If they resist sweep, invert to expose heel.
- Backside 50/50 transitions
  - From separated legs or successful sweeps:
    - Rotate hips and thread legs to reach backside 50/50.
    - Backside orientation:
      - Places spine in stronger line with opponent’s knee.
      - Limits their ability to roll safely.

Roll-following, mutual Ashi logic and far-hip Ashi
- Following a roll
  - As opponent rolls to escape:
    - Maintain knee-line and hip contact.
    - Choose whether to land in:
      - Outside ashi.
      - Backside 50/50.
      - Far-hip Ashi.
- Intro to mutual Ashi
  - Mutual Ashi identified as:
    - Symmetric outside-heel-hook environment.
    - Both players have active offensive capability.
- Going last
  - Strategic rule:
    - Avoid exposing heel first.
    - Force opponent to show heel by:
      - Hiding own foot behind far-hip and leg configuration.
      - Attacking with toe holds, knee bars and transitions.
- Rolling through and far-hip Ashi
  - Rolling through mutual Ashi exchanges:
    - Used to exit symmetric danger.
    - Seek to land in:
      - Far-hip Ashi that hides own feet.
      - Or back to classic Ashi families where asymmetry returns.

Gripping structures and closing notes
- Far-hip Ashi gripping
  - Emphasis on:
    - Controlling far hip to hide attacker’s own feet.
    - Using grips that maintain elbow and wrist safety while still threatening submissions.
- Gripping
  - General gripping rules in 50/50 and mutual Ashi:
    - Grip hierarchy prioritising:
      - Protecting own heel (high, tight grips near opponent’s foot).
      - Opening opponent’s heel line with minimal exposure.
- Outro
  - Reiteration of:
    - Importance of preferring asymmetrical leg positions.
    - Use of 50/50 and mutual Ashi as temporary waypoints to force transitions into stronger, safer attacking hubs.

========================
6.0 DRILLING PROGRESSIONS
========================

6.1 SOLO DRILLS
----------------

- Hip mobility and inversion prep
  - Seated hip-switch series
    - Alternate side-to-side hip switches from seated guard with one or both shins in front.
    - Focus on:
      - Rotating hips around a fixed foot.
      - Keeping spine tall to simulate posture in Ashi Garami.
  - Technical stand-up variations
    - Standard technical get-up with emphasis on:
      - Keeping one foot “hook-ready”.
      - Using posts that could become leg wedges in Irimi/Outside Ashi entries.
  - Granby / shoulder rolls into leg pummelling shapes
    - Forward and backward shoulder rolls that:
      - Finish with one leg threaded inside (Irimi-like position).
      - Finish with legs crossed (cross-Ashi-like feel).

- Ashi Garami shape and retention templates (no partner)
  - Shadow Irimi Ashi
    - Lie supine and:
      - Visualise opponent’s hip line.
      - Cycle through “perfect Irimi” leg positions:
        - Hips close.
        - Knees pinched.
        - Far leg monitored.
    - Add imaginary stress tests:
      - Opponent pulling back: you follow with hips.
      - Opponent driving forward: you adjust elbow and knee shield.
  - Shadow Outside Ashi
    - Practice:
      - Leg scissoring.
      - Cross-shin placement.
      - Belly-up → belly-down turns while keeping an imaginary knee line.
  - Shadow Cross / Inside Ashi
    - Transition between:
      - Standard cross Ashi.
      - Shoelace Ashi.
      - Stretch Ashi.
    - Focus on:
      - Keeping “opponent’s knee” line pinned in the hip pocket.
      - Switching imaginary primary vs secondary leg.

- Submission mechanics without partner
  - Achilles lock mechanics
    - Use a belt or small pad as “leg”.
    - Drill:
      - Hand positioning (standard and reverse figure-four).
      - High-elbow, chest-connection, and hip-bridge sequence.
  - Toe hold mechanics
    - Use belt to simulate foot:
      - Practice coupled-force pattern:
        - “Toes to glute, heel to chest”.
      - Drill both belly-up and belly-down body movements.
  - Heel hook mechanics
    - Belt or towel around foot:
      - Practice inside and outside heel hook grips.
      - Coordinate:
        - Torso rotation.
        - Hip drive.
        - Maintenance of imaginary knee line.
  - Knee bar mechanics
    - Use bolster/pad to simulate leg:
      - Drill:
        - Lat-knee-bar position.
        - Hip line in line with “knee”.
        - Core extension through pad while keeping shoulders anchored.

- Movement chains (solo flow rounds)
  - “Ashi ladder” solo flow
    - Shadow sequence:
      - Guard entry → Irimi Ashi → Outside Ashi → Cross Ashi → Inside Ashi → Backside 50/50 (shape only) → exit back to guard.
    - Aim for smooth transitions with minimal recovery steps.
  - Symmetry-to-asymmetry solo flow
    - Visualise:
      - Starting in 50/50 / mutual-Ashi shapes.
      - Moving through leg pummels and hip turns into:
        - Far-hip Ashi.
        - Outside/Cross Ashi.
      - Exiting back to top or guard.


6.2 PARTNER DRILLS
-------------------

- Static structure and stress-test drills
  - Irimi Ashi build-and-break drill
    - Phase 1: attacker builds perfect Irimi.
    - Phase 2: defender cycles through:
      - Straight-back knee escape.
      - Forward pressure.
      - Turning to knees.
      - In-place rotation.
    - Attacker:
      - Keeps ashi, uses minimal grips.
      - Learns to follow and re-pummel without panicking.
  - Outside Ashi stress-test circuit
    - Start in outside Ashi:
      - Defender executes:
        - High-leg attempts.
        - Kneeling turn-outs.
        - Controlled rolls.
      - Attacker:
        - Uses scissoring, cross-shin, and hip turns to keep knee line and heel exposure.
  - Cross Ashi stability and back-safety drill
    - From cross Ashi:
      - Defender tries to turn to attacker’s back or force double inversion.
      - Attacker:
        - Practices:
          - Chest recentering.
          - Transition to Inside Ashi or Far-Hip Ashi.
          - Resetting to simple, strong Ashi when structure feels loose.

- Entry and connection drills
  - Guard entry → Irimi Ashi flow
    - From seated/open guard:
      - Attacker practices 2–3 specific entries to Irimi Ashi (e.g. single-leg X-style, shin-to-shin, collar-drag to leg).
      - Once Irimi is set:
        - Pause.
        - Partner checks structural details (hip closeness, knee pinch, far-leg monitoring).
  - Irimi → Outside Ashi connection drill
    - Start in solid Irimi:
      - Attacker:
        - Transitions to Outside Ashi on coach’s clap or verbal cue.
        - Focus:
          - Knee line never drops.
          - Hips stay close during reorientation.
  - Butterfly Ashi connector
    - From Irimi:
      - Swing to butterfly Ashi.
      - Then re-enter:
        - Outside Ashi.
        - Cross Ashi.
      - Attacker tracks:
        - Control of far leg.
        - Heel visibility at each step.

- Submission-focused partner drills
  - Achilles control-and-finish rounds
    - Begin in safe Ashi with heel already visible.
    - Attacker:
      - Applies Achilles control.
      - Defender:
        - Rotates.
        - Scoots.
        - Attempts to free knee line without full power.
      - Goal:
        - Attacker learns to:
          - Maintain grip.
          - Use hip movement and leg wedges.
          - Only finish once defender “runs out” of safe options.
  - Toe hold dilemma drill
    - From Outside / Cross / Mutual Ashi:
      - Attacker:
        - Applies toe hold slowly.
      - Defender chooses:
        - Stay and attempt to endure (attacker emphasises safe but real pressure).
        - Unlock or extend leg.
      - Attacker follows decision:
        - If defender stays: carefully finish (light tap).
        - If defender unlocks: transition to heel hook or knee bar per script.
  - Heel-hook follow-the-roll drill
    - Start in heel-exposure position (inside and outside variations):
      - Attacker clamps knee line and heel.
      - Defender does 1–3 controlled rolls to “escape”.
      - Attacker must:
        - Stay glued.
        - Adjust Ashi mid-roll.
        - Land in a stable breaking position each time.

- Controlled entry and reset drills
  - “Three attacks, then reset”
    - From a chosen Ashi (Irimi / Outside / Cross / 50/50):
      - Attacker allowed exactly three linked submission attempts.
      - After 3rd attempt (finished or defended), reset to neutral.
    - Emphasises:
      - Chaining submissions instead of single, desperate attempts.
      - Accepting reset rather than forcing sloppy 4th/5th attacks.
  - “Leg-switch” drill
    - Start with one leg entangled.
    - Defender:
      - Defends correctly, making primary leg difficult to finish.
    - Attacker:
      - Must transition to secondary leg using prescribed sequences (e.g. Cross Ashi leg switch, 50/50 → Far-Hip switch).
      - No finish allowed on original leg – only on the new target.


6.3 SITUATIONAL SPARRING AND POSITIONAL ROUNDS
----------------------------------------------

- Position-start rounds (low intensity)
  - Irimi / Outside Ashi starts
    - Rounds begin with:
      - Attacker already in Irimi or Outside Ashi.
    - Attacker goals:
      - Maintain knee line.
      - Expose heel.
      - Either finish or cleanly transition to higher-power hub (Cross / Inside / Backside).
    - Defender goals:
      - Use main escape directions:
        - Back out.
        - Drive forward.
        - Turn to knees.
        - Roll.
      - Try to reach:
        - Full guard.
        - Half guard.
        - Standing.
  - Cross / Inside Ashi starts
    - Higher-consequence rounds:
      - Attacker starts in deep Cross or Inside Ashi.
    - Attacker:
      - Practices double trouble, heel-knee-bar options, transitions to Backside 50/50.
    - Defender:
      - Practices disciplined tapping and controlled escapes:
        - Early knee-line management.
        - Structured rolls rather than explosive spins.

- 50/50 and mutual Ashi rounds
  - Symmetric-position rounds
    - Start directly in:
      - 50/50 (belly-up).
      - Mutual Ashi.
    - Attacker/defender roles:
      - Option 1: free sparring – both can attack.
      - Option 2: designate “offense first” player to enforce “attack until you’re defending” rule.
    - Objectives:
      - Learn to:
        - Protect own feet first.
        - Use dilemmas to separate legs.
        - Transition back to asymmetry (Far-Hip / Outside / Cross / Backside).
  - “Go last” games (mutual Ashi)
    - Rounds where:
      - One player is tasked with:
        - Hiding heel.
        - Creating transition out of mutual Ashi before launching major attack.
      - Other player tries to strike first with heel hook.
    - Scoring ideas:
      - +1 for exiting to asymmetry safely.
      - +1 for controlled submission.
      - -1 for exposing own heel first.

- Directional / constraint-based rounds
  - Single-direction defence rounds
    - Coach calls one allowed escape direction for defender (e.g. “only back out”, “only roll”, “only turn to knees”).
    - Attacker:
      - Learns to recognise and punish that specific reaction from their Ashi.
    - Rotate directions every 1–2 minutes.
  - “No submission, only control” rounds
    - Attacker:
      - Not allowed to finish.
      - Must:
        - Maintain Ashi.
        - Follow rolls.
        - Switch legs.
      - Aim:
        - Hold opponent stuck in entanglements for entire round.
    - Builds confidence in control without relying on quick taps.
  - “No grips” entry rounds
    - From neutral guard/stand:
      - Attacker must enter Ashi and maintain control for 3–5 seconds before using any upper-body grip.
    - Emphasises:
      - Leg and hip positioning.
      - Proper Ashi construction before hand fighting.

- Integrated sparring blocks
  - Leg-lock-saturated rounds
    - 3–5 minute rounds where:
      - All major leg locks are legal (under training rules).
      - Start from neutral but with explicit permission to dive on legs.
    - Aim:
      - Integrate entries, Ashi transitions, and submissions under fatigue.
  - Leg-lock-restricted rounds
    - Opposite constraint:
      - No heel hooks (or no leg locks at all).
    - Objective:
      - Force recognition that:
        - Ashi Garami also link to sweeps, guard passes, and back takes.
        - System is not leg locks only, but leg-dominant control that feeds entire game.



=========================
7.0 APPLICATION SCENARIOS
=========================

7.1 COMPETITION SCENARIOS AND ADCC-STYLE ENTRIES
------------------------------------------------

- Pre-match leg-lock game planning
  - Decide in advance how leg locks integrate with overall game:
    - Leg locks as PRIMARY scoring strategy:
      - Constant entries from guard pulls, seated guard, and wrestling exchanges.
      - Comfortable accepting scrambles and invert-heavy sequences.
    - Leg locks as SECONDARY threat:
      - Use Ashi Garami to force reactions that open guard passes and back takes.
      - Prioritise positional control if opponent is leg-lock-savvy.
  - Identify “green light” opponent types:
    - Heavy wrestling / low-stance players whose front leg is constantly exposed.
    - Guard players who are reluctant to stand and whose feet stay close to hips.

- Early-phase entries (no points / opening minutes)
  - Standing and wrestling:
    - Snap-down → front headlock → shin-to-shin or single-leg-X-style Irimi entries.
    - Arm-drag or collar tie to off-balance; when opponent posts, shoot into Irimi Ashi.
  - Guard pulls and seated entries:
    - Immediate shin-to-shin or outside-step entries into Irimi Ashi.
    - Use gripping to “steer” posted leg into Ashi before opponent can establish upper-body grips.
  - Strategy:
    - In early minutes, prioritise unscouted leg entries:
      - Opponent is less warmed up.
      - Less ready to respect legs if known as “non-leglocker”.

- Mid-match sequences when opponent is leg-lock-aware
  - Opponent starts hand-fighting ankles and hiding heels:
    - Use leg entanglements to:
      - Clamp hips.
      - Force them to retreat or turn.
    - Convert their defensive behaviour into:
      - Sweeps from Irimi / 50/50.
      - Top Ushiro and passing when they over-rotate.
  - Typical mid-match pattern:
    - Guard entry → Irimi Ashi.
    - Opponent hand-fights hard / backs out.
    - Attacker uses back-step or technical stand-up to:
      - Come on top.
      - Immediately pass or settle chest-to-chest pin.

- Late-phase / chasing points or submissions
  - If behind on points:
    - Use leg locks as high-leverage comeback tool:
      - Accept more risk in 50/50 or mutual Ashi if time is short.
      - Choose dilemmas that force opponent to either:
        - Sit and stall (risk stalling calls, no advancement).
        - Move and expose heel.
  - If ahead on points:
    - Continue to use Ashi Garami as:
      - Control positions that slow pace.
      - Platforms for safe sweeps and top control.
    - Be conservative with deep mutual-Ashi shootouts that could flip the result.

- ADCC-style specific considerations
  - No-gi, wrestling-heavy entries:
    - Emphasise:
      - Single-leg-X / Irimi entries off failed shots.
      - Countering sprawls by sliding into Outside or Cross Ashi instead of re-shooting.
  - Overtime or submission-only emphasis:
    - More tolerance for extended Ashi exchanges:
      - Use Backside 50/50 and Far-Hip Ashi repeatedly to fatigue opponent’s hips.
      - Chain toe holds and heel hooks to create incremental damage and mental pressure.


7.2 MANAGING SPASTIC, EXPLOSIVE AND LEG-LOCK-NOVICE OPPONENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Spastic / explosive athletes
  - Risk profile:
    - Sudden, uncontrolled spins and jumps.
    - High chance of accidental knee/ankle injury if submissions are applied too quickly.
  - Positional choices:
    - Prioritise:
      - 50/50 and Far-Hip Ashi as “seat-belt” controls:
        - Hips pinned.
        - Feet hidden.
      - Clean, high-friction Ashi where their ability to cartwheel or stand is limited.
    - Avoid:
      - Loose Cross Ashi where opponent can unexpectedly cartwheel or roll through.
      - Situations where they can free second leg and launch into unpredictable scrambles.
  - Strategy:
    - Focus on sweeps and back exposure from Ashi, not just breaks.
    - Apply submissions with slower, highly telegraphed pressure in training.

- Strong but technically green opponents
  - Typical behaviour:
    - Do not understand heel / toe-hold danger.
    - Resist rotational submissions far too long.
  - Adjustments in training:
    - Use straight Achilles and controlled toe holds as primary finishers.
    - For heel hooks:
      - Stop well before full pressure.
      - Verbally cue taps (“this is where you must tap”) before continuing.
    - Spend time in control-focused rounds:
      - Emphasise “I can hold you here indefinitely” rather than chasing taps.

- Leg-lock-novice partners and students
  - Phased exposure:
    - Phase 1:
      - Teach Ashi as control, sweeps and positional game.
      - No heel hooks; very gentle toe holds and Achilles only.
    - Phase 2:
      - Introduce heel-hook positions and escape concepts.
      - Heel hooks applied at minimal speed with pre-agreed early tap.
    - Phase 3:
      - Only after consistent good habits:
        - Higher-intensity leg-lock rounds.
        - Competition-style speed when appropriate partners are available.
  - Communication:
    - Always clarify:
      - Which submissions are live in the round.
      - Expected tap timing (very early on rotational submissions).
      - Safe words / “stop” calls if they feel unsure.

- Use of 50/50 as control vs chaos
  - Against chaotic movers:
    - 50/50 used less as a finishing hub, more as:
      - A “seat-belt” to stop explosive passing or scramble-based escapes.
      - A way to slow match and force them into structured leg pummelling.
    - From 50/50:
      - Sweep to top.
      - Stabilise in half-guard or headquarters rather than diving straight back on legs.


7.3 RULESET-DEPENDENT STRATEGY AND POSITIONAL CHOICES
-----------------------------------------------------

- Heel-hook-legal environments
  - Submission bias:
    - Favour Inside Heel Hooks from:
      - Cross / Inside Ashi.
      - Backside 50/50.
      - Far-Hip Ashi.
    - Use Outside Heel Hooks heavily from:
      - Outside Ashi.
      - Mutual Ashi (when you are structurally safer).
  - Positional implications:
    - Symmetric positions (50/50, mutual Ashi) become higher value but higher risk:
      - You must be technically superior to exploit them safely.
    - Backside 50/50 and Far-Hip Ashi are core destinations:
      - Combine high finishing percentage with improved safety for your own legs.

- Heel-hooks-illegal but toe holds / straight ankle locks allowed
  - Mechanical re-mapping:
    - Keep Ashi family structure almost identical.
    - Swap heel-hook endings for:
      - Toe holds.
      - Achilles locks.
      - Knee bars.
  - Prioritised submissions:
    - From Outside / Cross Ashi:
      - Toe-hold → knee-bar chains.
      - Achilles → toe-hold dilemmas.
    - From 50/50:
      - Toe-hold / separation games that lead to sweeps and top position.
  - Positional restraints:
    - Be mindful of reaping rules:
      - Some rule sets penalise certain leg-line angles even without heel hooks.
      - Adjust angle of hips and knees to maintain legal entanglements.

- Straight-ankle-only / “basic leg locks” rules
  - Strategy shift:
    - Use Ashi Garami as:
      - Sweep and reversal platforms.
      - Ways to off-balance and expose back, not just feet.
    - Make Achilles locks as efficient as possible:
      - Strong breaking mechanics.
      - Well-timed application when opponent is off-balance.
  - Game emphasis:
    - Irimi, Outside and 50/50 become:
      - Powerful sweeping tools.
      - Setups for back takes once opponent turns strongly to hide ankle.

- Gi vs no-gi adjustments
  - Gi:
    - Extra friction makes:
      - Retention of Ashi easier.
      - Rotational escapes slower.
    - But:
      - Grips on pants and sleeves can hinder entries and rolling follow-the-leg behaviour.
    - Strategy:
      - Use more off-balancing with sleeve/lapel to force leg exposure.
      - Expect slower but more stubborn defensive spins.
  - No-gi:
    - Entries off wrestling and clinch are more important.
    - Opponent can slip out of poor Ashi more easily; precision in hip line and wedges is critical.


7.4 TRAINING AND ROLLING SCENARIOS FOR SYSTEM INTEGRATION
---------------------------------------------------------

- Block-based integration within general training
  - Dedicated “leg-lock block” within overall cycle:
    - Example:
      - 4–8 weeks where:
        - Warmups include Ashi shapes and solo movements.
        - Technical portion emphasises one Ashi family per session.
        - Positional sparring always has at least one leg-lock scenario.
    - Maintain:
      - Some non-leg-lock techniques to avoid over-specialisation.
  - Post-block consolidation:
    - After intensive block:
      - Reduce dedicated leg-lock rounds.
      - Keep 1–2 Ashi starting rounds per week to maintain sharpness.

- Scenario-based rounds tied to competition strategy
  - Score-specific rounds:
    - “You are down by 2 points with 2 minutes left, start in seated guard”:
      - Encourage fast Irimi / Outside Ashi entries.
      - Practice balancing urgency and control.
    - “You are up by 2 points, start in Outside Ashi”:
      - Work on:
        - Safe maintenance.
        - Sweep to top.
        - Positional stabilisation rather than desperate submission attempts.
  - Ruleset-specific nights:
    - “ADCC night”:
      - More wrestling entries.
      - Broad leg-lock allowance.
    - “IBJJF night”:
      - No heel hooks.
      - Emphasis on using Ashi to sweep, pass, take back.

- Integrating leg locks with passing and back attacks
  - Leg-to-pass chains:
    - If opponent refuses to engage feet:
      - Use Ashi entries to force them to over-hide heels.
      - As they retract legs, step in for body lock or knee-cut passing.
  - Leg-to-back chains:
    - When opponent turns aggressively to free knee:
      - Transition from Outside / Far-Hip Ashi to:
        - Chair-sit back takes.
        - Top Ushiro, then hooks.
  - Training prescription:
    - Drills where:
      - Attacker’s goal is to either:
        - Finish leg lock.
        - Or achieve clean pass/back within 3–4 linked actions.
      - Any “stall” beyond 3–4 actions triggers reset.

- Long-term development and profiling
  - Style profiling:
    - Identify whether athlete is:
      - ENTRY-ORIENTED (good at getting into Ashi quickly).
      - CONTROL-ORIENTED (excellent retention, slower at finishing).
      - FINISH-ORIENTED (good mechanics but sometimes overcommits).
    - Adjust focus:
      - Entry-oriented:
        - More work on retention and stress tests.
      - Control-oriented:
        - More work on finishing speed and timing.
      - Finish-oriented:
        - More work on positional exits and safe resets.
  - Periodic review:
    - Every few months, re-run:
      - Positional rounds.
      - Submission-only rounds.
    - Track:
      - Which Ashi families actually appear most in live training.
      - Which submissions produce most taps vs most escapes.
    - Update:
      - Preferred “A-game” Ashi hubs.
      - Drilling priorities for next block.

===========================
ANNEX A: EXTRACTED KEY PASSAGES
===========================

A.1 SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY AND ASYMMETRY
-----------------------------------

- Leg locks as a structural exploit
  - Historically, most grapplers invest far more training into upper-body
    submissions and control (chokes, armlocks, classic pinning) than into
    lower-body systems.
  - This knowledge gap is treated as an opportunity: a well-organised leg
    lock system allows a relatively small technical investment to yield
    disproportionate competitive advantage.
  - The objective is not to bolt on a few leg submissions, but to build a
    complete lower-body subsystem with:
    - Its own positional hierarchy.
    - Clear transitions and re-attacks.
    - Integrated safety and training rules.

- Asymmetry as the central organising principle
  - The fundamental strategic goal is to create and maintain asymmetrical
    leg positions:
    - One player has robust access to the opponent’s legs and heels.
    - The opponent has limited or no meaningful access to the attacker’s
      feet.
  - Preferred attacking positions are asymmetrical Ashi Garami variants:
    - Irimi Ashi.
    - Outside Ashi.
    - Cross / Inside Ashi.
    - Backside 50/50.
    - Far-Hip Ashi.
    - Ushiro-style top positions.
  - Symmetrical positions like 50/50 and Mutual Ashi are recognised as
    dangerous for both players:
    - Both can attack the same submissions.
    - There is no built-in structural advantage; only superior understanding
      and timing give an edge.

- Ashi Garami as control architecture, not just submissions
  - Entanglements are treated as control positions comparable to pins or
    back control in an upper-body game:
    - They can generate submissions.
    - They can also be used to sweep, stall, reset, or transition to other
      dominant positions.
  - A technically correct leg lock system:
    - Maintains positional superiority even when submissions fail.
    - Frequently converts failed submissions into improved pins, back takes
      or dominant top control.

- Unifying idea: control first, breaking second
  - The leg lock system is built on the premise that submission attempts
    should arise from strong control positions:
    - Strong wedges around hips and knees.
    - Clear shoulder and head positioning.
    - Clear understanding of the opponent’s likely escape routes.
  - Breaking mechanics are layered on top of this positional base rather
    than being treated as isolated “finishing tricks”.


A.2 ROLE AND HIERARCHY OF ASHI GARAMI FAMILIES
----------------------------------------------

- Core family roles
  - Irimi Ashi:
    - Most accessible and common initial entanglement.
    - Frequently entered from:
      - Guard pulls.
      - Seated guard.
      - Failed takedowns.
      - Top player counter-attacks.
    - Primary function:
      - Initial control and knee-line capture.
      - Early Achilles / heel-hook dilemmas.
      - Gateway into Outside Ashi or Butterfly Ashi.
  - Outside Ashi:
    - Primary outside-heel-hook hub.
    - Strong emphasised features:
      - Excellent back-exposure denial via leg scissoring and cross-shin.
      - Reliable finishing mechanics once heel is exposed.
    - Often the “home base” once Irimi has done its job as the entry.
  - Cross Ashi:
    - High-power inverted-heel-hook platform.
    - Natural double-trouble environment:
      - One leg is the primary breaking target.
      - The second leg is controlled to constrain rotations.
    - Higher risk of back exposure if leg and hip wedges are poorly managed.
  - Inside Ashi:
    - Structurally related to Cross Ashi but oriented for outside heel hooks.
    - Commonly appears when:
      - Defender turns to “correct” their hip.
      - Attacker follows and re-orients to maintain leg access.

- Symmetric family roles
  - 50/50:
    - Both players have mirrored entanglements; both can often attack similar
      heel-hook options.
    - Treated as:
      - Useful control position against explosive or spastic opponents.
      - Transitional battlefield where whoever wins inside-knee and grip
        dominance controls the initiative.
  - Mutual Ashi:
    - Contextualised as a “50/50 of outside heel hooks”:
      - Both players have outside-Ashi-style control.
      - Both can attack outside heel hooks.
    - Typically entered unintentionally:
      - From losing leg pummels.
      - From leaving a leg behind during transitions.
    - Strategically:
      - A position that must be navigated out of into asymmetry.
      - Not a position to “live in” by deliberate choice.

- High-offence hub roles
  - Backside 50/50:
    - Upgraded 50/50 with attacker’s body rotated behind the defender’s knee
      and hip line.
    - Advantages:
      - Stronger heel exposure.
      - Fewer meaningful defensive rotations for the opponent.
      - Clear inside-heel-hook routes.
  - Far-Hip Ashi:
    - Asymmetrical structure that:
      - Hides attacker’s own feet behind the far-hip hook.
      - Allows controlled heel or toe-hold attacks with improved safety.
    - Frequently used:
      - As a safe exit from Mutual Ashi or chaotic exchanges.
  - Ushiro (especially Top Ushiro):
    - Top-position control derived from leg entanglements.
    - Gives:
      - High control over hips.
      - Multiple finishing lines (heel, toe, knee bar).
      - Natural pathways into back takes.

- Hierarchical view
  - Entry hubs:
    - Irimi Ashi, sometimes Outside Ashi.
  - Consolidation hubs:
    - Outside Ashi, Cross / Inside Ashi.
  - High-offence hubs:
    - Backside 50/50, Far-Hip Ashi, Ushiro.
  - Symmetric detours:
    - 50/50, Mutual Ashi (short-term battlefields that must be converted
      back into asymmetry).


A.3 KNEE LINE, WEDGES AND CONNECTION
------------------------------------

- Knee line as the primary indicator of success or failure
  - Leg locks are presented as knee-line games first, submission games
    second.
  - If the defender’s knee is not past the attacker’s hip line, the attack
    is structurally weak regardless of how strong the grip feels.
  - Common coaching emphasis:
    - Before asking “is my grip good?”, ask “do I fully own the knee line?”.

- Wedges as the engine of control
  - Effective Ashi Garami uses multiple wedges:
    - Thigh and hip wedges clamping the defender’s upper leg.
    - Cross-shin, scissoring or hook wedges controlling the hips.
    - Torso and shoulder wedges controlling the direction of defender’s
      rotation.
  - Correct wedges:
    - Reduce the need for maximal muscular effort.
    - Allow time for transitions and grip adjustments without losing control.

- Upper-body connection as a supplement, not the foundation
  - The system repeatedly stresses that:
    - The legs and hips should bear most of the structural load.
    - Hands are primarily used to:
      - Fine-tune foot and heel angles.
      - Apply breaking pressure once the structure is stable.
  - Test:
    - If you briefly let go with your hands and the position collapses,
      the Ashi was structurally unsound.

- Compact, connected body positioning
  - The attacker’s hips should be close to the defender’s hips:
    - Long, extended positions are discouraged because they:
      - Give defender space to spin.
      - Make knee-line retention difficult.
  - Spine and core remain engaged, avoiding:
    - Loose “lying flat” posture.
    - Over-reaching with arms in place of hip movement.


A.4 LEG PUMMELLING, SYMMETRY AND 50/50 LOGIC
--------------------------------------------

- Leg pummelling as a central skill
  - Just as upper-body grappling emphasises hand-fighting and grip
    pummelling, the leg-lock system depends heavily on leg pummelling.
  - Key pummelling battles:
    - Who holds inside position with their legs.
    - Who can thread legs between Ashi families (Irimi → Outside → Cross /
      Inside → Backside / Far-Hip).
  - Losing the pummel:
    - Common route to Mutual Ashi and undesired 50/50 situations.
    - Typical cause of “mystery scrambles” where both players suddenly have
      leg attacks.

- Understanding symmetry vs asymmetry in 50/50
  - In 50/50:
    - Both players share similar leverage and potential attack lines.
    - There is no built-in positional advantage; only the player who:
      - Gains inside knee.
      - Controls grips better.
      - Understands the decision tree more deeply.
    - That player essentially turns symmetry into effective asymmetry at the
      tactical level.
  - System rules for 50/50:
    - “Attack until you’re defending”:
      - The first player to create true heel exposure often dictates the
        subsequent exchange.
      - Delaying or “waiting to see” risks giving initiative to the other
        player.

- Mutual Ashi and the “go last” principle
  - In Mutual Ashi, both players have potent outside-heel-hook options.
  - The system emphasises:
    - The need to hide one’s own heel before threatening the opponent’s.
    - The principle of “going last”:
      - If you expose your heel first, you are structurally behind.
      - Prioritise safety (Far-Hip Ashi, foot tucks, leg shields) before
        launching attacks.

- Semi-sankaku and defensive locks
  - Defenders often use semi-sankaku and crossed-ankle structures:
    - To hide heels and prevent separation of their legs.
  - Offensive response:
    - Use toe holds and other fast-onset threats to force them to unlock.
    - Once unlock occurs, immediate transition to heel hooks or knee bars
      is expected.


A.5 SUBMISSION HIERARCHY AND BREAKING MECHANICS
-----------------------------------------------

- Inside vs outside heel hook
  - Inside heel hook:
    - Viewed as the strongest mechanical option.
    - More tolerant of minor technical imperfections.
    - Preferred when rules permit and position allows safe application.
  - Outside heel hook:
    - Still highly effective but:
      - Demands more precise alignment.
      - Requires careful management of defender’s rotation.
  - Strategic takeaway:
    - Develop competence in both.
    - Default to inside heel hook when both are equally available.

- Toe hold mechanics and tactical use
  - Toe hold is described as:
    - A fast-onset, high-pain submission.
    - Primarily powered by upper-body torque but enhanced by body
      positioning.
  - True breaking pressure depends on:
    - Driving toes toward the glutes.
    - Pulling heel toward chest or opposite shoulder.
    - Fixing the knee line to prevent leg turning freely.
  - Tactical role:
    - Ideal for forcing defensive movements that open stronger heel-hooks or
      knee-bar opportunities.
    - Often used in shootout environments (50/50, Mutual Ashi, Ushiro).

- Achilles lock as control and weapon
  - Achilles lock serves dual purposes:
    - As a legitimate finishing hold (especially in rulesets that restrict
      twisting submissions).
    - As a tethering mechanism:
      - Keeps the defender “on the leash” while the attacker:
        - Re-pummels legs.
        - Moves between Ashi families.
  - Correct mechanics emphasise:
    - Hips as main power source.
    - Elbow and wrist positioning that prevents defender from slipping heel
      out easily.

- Knee bar mechanics and variations
  - Knee bar hierarchy:
    - Best structures:
      - Double-trouble knee bars with control over both legs.
      - Lat knee bars where the defender’s leg is tightly draped across
        attacker’s torso and shoulder.
      - Heel knee-bar hybrids that blend heel control with knee-bar hip
        mechanics.
    - Weaker structures:
      - “One-leg-only” knee bars where secondary leg and hips are uncontrolled.
  - Key mechanical cues:
    - Hip line must be aligned with defender’s knee joint.
    - Torso and hips extend in a unified direction.
    - Defender’s rotations are constrained by wedges at the hip and ankle.

- Ruleset-dependent emphasis
  - When heel hooks are legal:
    - Inside heel hooks become primary finishing options.
    - Toe holds and knee bars are used to generate transitions or punish
      specific defensive reactions.
  - When heel hooks are illegal:
    - The same Ashi structures are kept.
    - Finishers are systematically remapped:
      - From heel hooks toward toe holds, Achilles and knee bars.
    - Mechanics do not change; only the terminal options do.


A.6 DILEMMAS, SHOOTOUTS AND RULESETS
------------------------------------

- Dilemma-based offensive design
  - For each main Ashi configuration, a primary dilemma is defined:
    - Achilles vs heel hook.
    - Toe hold vs knee bar.
    - Toe hold vs heel hook.
  - The defender is forced into a constrained decision:
    - Accept the current submission and risk tapping.
    - Or move in a way that feeds the secondary submission.
  - This discourages:
    - Random, unstructured attacks.
    - Instead, the system promotes pre-planned two- and three-step
      sequences.

- Managing leg-lock shootouts
  - “Shootout” situations occur most frequently in:
    - 50/50.
    - Mutual Ashi.
    - Scrambles where both players have some access to feet.
  - System guidance:
    - If shootouts cannot be avoided, they must at least be understood and
      rehearsed.
    - Priority in shootouts:
      - Protect your own heel first.
      - Use fast-onset toe holds to force decisions.
      - Transition to structurally safer dominance (Backside 50/50, Far-Hip).

- Ruleset and tactical risk management
  - The higher the value of a position in a given ruleset, the more
    comfortable the system is in taking risk there:
    - For example, in submission-only or heel-hook-legal formats:
      - Deep Cross / Inside Ashi and Backside 50/50 hold tremendous value.
    - In points-based or heel-hook-restricted formats:
      - Leg entanglements are important but must often be converted into
        sweeps and positional control rather than pure submission attempts.
  - Tactical adjustments:
    - When ahead on points:
      - Use Ashi more as control and sweep platform.
      - Avoid long mutual-Ashi shootouts that could turn the match.
    - When behind on points:
      - Be more willing to accept risk in symmetric positions to chase fast
        finishes.


A.7 FOLLOWING THE LEG, RESETTING AND STRATEGIC EXITS
----------------------------------------------------

- Following the leg through rolls and scrambles
  - The system expects defenders to:
    - Roll multiple times.
    - Spin explosively.
    - Change directions abruptly.
  - Attacker responsibilities:
    - Stay glued to the defender’s knee and heel.
    - Move hips and shoulders with the rotation instead of relying on arm
      strength alone.
    - Aim to land in a pre-chosen hub (Outside Ashi, Cross / Inside, Backside
      50/50, Far-Hip) rather than accepting random shapes.

- Resetting when structure degrades
  - Whenever control feels:
    - Disorganised.
    - Extended.
    - Disconnected from the knee line.
  - The default instruction is:
    - Re-centre chest toward opponent’s hips.
    - Simplify back to a reliable Ashi (Irimi, Outside, or a clean Cross).
  - This mindset:
    - Reduces desperation finishing attempts from bad positions.
    - Protects training partners.
    - Preserves positional advantage even without an immediate tap.

- Strategic exits: when to abandon the leg entirely
  - Conditions for exit:
    - Knee line clearly lost.
    - Opponent starting to gain strong passing or back-taking angles.
    - Your own feet or knees in danger from an emerging counter-attack.
  - Preferred exit routes:
    - Back to guard:
      - Use frames and pummels to re-establish more neutral guards.
    - To stand-up:
      - Technical stand-up or post-and-rise while keeping grips that slow
        the opponent’s advance.
  - The system frames this as a success if:
    - You exit safely.
    - You preserve knee health.
    - You retain the option to re-enter on your own terms later.


=====================
ANNEX B: TERMINOLOGY
=====================

B.1 POSITIONAL TERMINOLOGY
--------------------------

- Knee line
  - Imaginary horizontal line at the level of the defender’s knee.
  - If the defender’s knee is still “inside” the attacker’s hip line
    (i.e. between the attacker’s hips and chest), the attacker controls
    the knee line and has realistic breaking potential.
  - If the knee slides past the attacker’s hip line (toward the defender’s
    own foot), the leg is essentially free regardless of how tight the
    grip on the foot feels.
  - Core principle:
    - “No knee line, no break.” Every decision is subordinated to keeping
      or regaining the knee line.

- Hip line
  - Horizontal line running across the attacker’s pelvis.
  - Used as a reference for:
    - Whether the defender’s knee is above/below/through the hips.
    - How effectively the attacker’s hips can project force into the leg.
  - Many corrections are simply:
    - “Bring your hips closer to their hip line.”
    - “Do not let their knee drop below your hip line.”

- Irimi Ashi Garami
  - Fundamental single-leg entanglement used as:
    - Primary entry hub.
    - First “real” control over the leg.
  - Typically resembles single-leg X / entry Ashi:
    - One leg under opponent’s thigh.
    - Other leg controlling hip line or far hip.
  - Roles:
    - Initial knee-line capture.
    - Early Achilles / heel-hook threats.
    - Launchpad into Outside or Butterfly Ashi.

- Outside Ashi Garami
  - Asymmetrical entanglement where attacker’s torso is oriented more
    toward the outside of the trapped leg.
  - Classical “outside-heel” position:
    - Strong scissoring of legs.
    - One shin often across opponent’s hip line.
  - Roles:
    - Primary hub for outside heel hooks.
    - Back-exposure denial when leg scissoring is correct.
    - Stable finishing platform after Irimi entries.

- Cross Ashi Garami
  - Crossed-leg entanglement controlling one or both of the opponent’s
    legs from a cross-body orientation.
  - Hallmarks:
    - Attacker’s thighs are crossed or stacked around the defender’s leg.
    - Commonly used to generate inverted-heel-hook angles.
  - Roles:
    - High-power finishing hub (especially inside heel hooks).
    - Natural double-trouble environment when secondary leg is laced or
      controlled.

- Inside Ashi
  - Family of configurations structurally similar to Cross Ashi but
    oriented to favour outside heel hooks.
  - Often appears when:
    - Defender turns their hips to “correct” alignment.
    - Attacker follows and rotates with them.
  - Roles:
    - Bridge between Cross Ashi and Outside Ashi.
    - Strong finishing position when opponent over-rotates to escape.

- 50/50
  - Symmetric leg entanglement where both players:
    - Have intertwined legs in the same general configuration.
    - Can often access heel hooks and straight foot locks.
  - Properties:
    - No built-in positional advantage.
    - Whoever wins inside knee position, grip fighting and decision tree
      usually wins the exchange.
  - Roles:
    - Control position for explosive opponents.
    - Transitional battlefield to be converted back to asymmetry.

- Mutual Ashi
  - Symmetric configuration where both players have outside-Ashi-style
    control on each other.
  - Functional interpretation:
    - “50/50 of outside heel hooks.”
    - Both players can attack outside heel hooks with similar leverage.
  - Roles:
    - Unplanned outcome of lost pummelling or poorly managed transitions.
    - Short-term shootout environment; not a desirable “home base.”

- Butterfly Ashi
  - Variation where:
    - Attacker uses a butterfly-style hook (instep inside opponent’s thigh)
      combined with Ashi control on the primary leg.
  - Roles:
    - Connector between Irimi and other Ashi families.
    - Useful against opponents who drive forward or stand.

- Post Ashi
  - Ashi variant used when opponent posts on hands or feet to stand or
    drive forward.
  - Attacker:
    - Uses the post as an additional wedge.
    - Re-orients hips to maintain knee line while opponent changes level.
  - Roles:
    - Transitional hub during stand-up attempts.
    - Setup for sweeps and belly-down finishes.

- Far-Hip Ashi
  - Ashi variation where attacker:
    - Uses a hook, shin or leg configuration that directly controls the
      opponent’s far hip.
  - Primary objectives:
    - Hide attacker’s own feet behind the far hip.
    - Limit defender’s ability to rotate freely.
  - Roles:
    - Safety shell when leaving symmetric positions.
    - Platform for safe heel / toe-hold attacks.

- Backside 50/50
  - Variant of 50/50 where:
    - Attacker’s body is rotated behind the defender’s knee and hip.
    - Defender’s hips are often turned away.
  - Properties:
    - Strong heel exposure (especially inside heel hooks).
    - Severely limited defensive rotations.
  - Roles:
    - High-value finishing hub.
    - Natural result of correctly following rolls from standard 50/50 or
      Cross/Inside Ashi.

- Top Ushiro
  - Top-position derivative of leg entanglements where:
    - Attacker is seated or kneeling behind or beside the defender’s hips.
    - One or both legs are still entangled.
  - Roles:
    - Hybrid between leg-control position and classic top pins.
    - Strong platform for:
      - Heel hooks.
      - Toe holds.
      - Knee bars.
      - Transitions to full back control.


B.2 CONTROL & MECHANICAL CONCEPTS
---------------------------------

- Knee-line control
  - Continuous requirement to keep defender’s knee:
    - Above, at or inside the attacker’s hip line.
  - Primary questions:
    - “Where is their knee now relative to my hips?”
    - “What wedge is preventing it from sliding out?”
  - If these cannot be answered positively, submission work is secondary.

- Hip wedges
  - Use of thighs, shins and hips to:
    - Pin defender’s femur.
    - Stop their pelvis from turning freely.
  - Examples:
    - Leg scissoring around thigh.
    - Cross-shin framed across waist.
    - Thigh clamp pinching defender’s upper leg.
  - Good hip wedges:
    - Force defender’s rotations to move their own knee into danger.
    - Make straight-line escapes (sliding knee out) impossible.

- Leg scissoring
  - Configuration where attacker’s legs act like scissors:
    - One leg above the defender’s trapped thigh.
    - One leg below, creating a clamping effect.
  - Functions:
    - Controls hip rotation.
    - Directs the path of defender’s rolls.
    - Amplifies the impact of small hip movements.

- Cross-shin control
  - Use of attacker’s shin across defender’s waist or hip line.
  - Functions:
    - Secondary wedge preventing hip movement.
    - Reinforces back-exposure denial in Outside Ashi.
    - Helps re-capture high-leg attempts by redirecting the thigh.

- Double trouble
  - Principle of controlling two of the opponent’s legs instead of one.
  - Implementation:
    - Cross Ashi with both legs trapped.
    - Leg-lace configurations.
    - Ushiro-style positions with both ankles controlled.
  - Effects:
    - Severely reduces defender’s standing, heisting and spinning options.
    - Greatly increases finishing reliability (heel hooks, knee bars).

- Semi-sankaku
  - Partial triangle configuration created by defender’s own legs:
    - Knees pinched.
    - Ankles crossed or figure-foured.
  - Defensive purposes:
    - Keeps heels hidden.
    - Makes it difficult to separate legs for clear heel exposure.
  - Offensive response:
    - Toe holds and semi-sankaku separation mechanics used to pry open
      structure.

- Leg pummelling
  - Dynamic exchange of inside/outside leg positions, analogous to hand-
    fighting in upper-body grappling.
  - Uses:
    - Enter and exit between Ashi families.
    - Recover inside position when lost.
    - Break opponent’s semi-sankaku or defensive leg locks.
  - Outcome:
    - Who controls pummelling usually controls which Ashi appears and who
      has initiative.

- Inside position (legs)
  - Having one or both of your legs threaded inside the opponent’s legs.
  - Importance:
    - Enables direct Ashi entries.
    - Blocks opponent from easily closing their defensive structures.
    - Often the decisive factor in 50/50 battles.

- “Going last”
  - Strategic concept particularly for Mutual Ashi:
    - Do not be the first to expose your heel.
    - First priority:
      - Hide your own foot (e.g. Far-Hip hook, tucking under their body).
    - Only once safe:
      - Begin to threaten their heel.
  - This concept:
    - Reduces risk in symmetric battles.
    - Forces opponent to compromise their own safety to attack.

- “Attack until you’re defending”
  - Functional rule in 50/50:
    - When you enter 50/50 with no immediate threat on your foot:
      - It is your responsibility to attack first.
    - Once opponent creates a real threat:
      - Shift to defence (protect heel, re-pummel, aim for Far-Hip or
        asymmetry).
  - Prevents:
    - Passive, neutral 50/50 where opponent seizes initiative without
      resistance.


B.3 SUBMISSION TERMINOLOGY
--------------------------

- Achilles lock (straight ankle lock)
  - Submission targeting:
    - Achilles tendon.
    - Ankle joint.
  - Mechanism:
    - Forearm presses into Achilles as fulcrum.
    - Hips extend, pulling foot over the fulcrum.
  - Key elements:
    - Tight bite on Achilles (no slack between wrist and tendon).
    - Elbow glued to ribs or hip.
    - Hips close to defender’s hips, generating force through entire chain.
  - Strategic role:
    - Credible finishing tool, especially in straight-ankle-only rulesets.
    - “Handle” for controlling opponent while re-pummelling or transitioning.

- Toe hold
  - Submission targeting:
    - Ankle and mid-foot via twisting torque.
  - Mechanism:
    - One hand controls the toes.
    - Other hand controls ankle / heel.
    - Combined twisting action bends foot laterally and plantarflexes it.
  - Effective application requires:
    - Toes driven toward defender’s glutes.
    - Heel pulled toward attacker’s chest or opposite shoulder.
    - Knee line controlled so leg cannot simply spin to relieve pressure.
  - Strategic role:
    - Fast-onset “pain and movement” tool.
    - Primary weapon for opening stubborn leg locks and semi-sankaku.

- Inside heel hook
  - Rotational submission where foot is rotated inward relative to defender.
  - Targets:
    - Primarily medial structures of the knee.
    - Also stresses ankle.
  - Mechanics:
    - Attacker wedges forearm around heel.
    - Hips and torso rotate opposite to defender’s knee orientation.
    - Knee line fully controlled.
  - Characteristics:
    - Highest mechanical potential for catastrophic damage.
    - Most efficient option when available and rules allow.
  - Strategic role:
    - Primary finishing option from Cross/Inside Ashi, Backside 50/50 and
      strong Far-Hip Ashi.

- Outside heel hook
  - Rotational submission where foot is rotated outward relative to defender.
  - Targets:
    - Lateral structures of knee and ankle.
  - Mechanics:
    - Similar to inside heel hook but with reversed rotation direction.
    - Traditionally considered slightly more difficult to break strong,
      flexible opponents.
  - Strategic role:
    - Main finishing option from Outside Ashi and many Mutual-Ashi entries.
    - Still extremely dangerous when mechanics are correct.

- Heel knee bar (hybrid)
  - Hybrid submission blending heel-hook control with knee-bar hip drive.
  - Structure:
    - Heel controlled as in heel hook.
    - Hips extend as in knee bar, driving force through knee line while
      heel orientation prevents free rotation.
  - Role:
    - Limits defender’s spin options.
    - Offers alternative breaking path when pure knee bar or pure heel hook
      is difficult to finish.

- Knee bar
  - Hyperextension submission targeting the knee joint.
  - Mechanics:
    - Attacker’s hips align with defender’s knee.
    - Defender’s leg trapped between attacker’s torso and hips.
    - Hips extend while upper body anchors leg in place.
  - Strong variations:
    - Double-trouble knee bars (both legs controlled).
    - Lat knee bars (leg draped across attacker’s torso and shoulder).
  - Strategic role:
    - Often paired with toe holds as a dilemma.
    - Natural follow-up when defender straightens leg to escape toe holds.

- Calf slicer
  - Compression submission where defender’s calf is crushed between attacker’s
    shin and thigh.
  - Targets:
    - Calf muscle and soft tissue behind knee.
  - Role in system:
    - Often appears as a switch from toe-hold or knee-recapture attempts.
    - Used to force reactions and break posture when leg is heavily bent.


=========================
ANNEX C: ADDITIONAL NOTES
=========================

C.1 TRAINING SAFETY, PROGRESSION AND COMMUNICATION
--------------------------------------------------

- General risk profile of leg locks
  - Lower-body submissions, especially rotational ones (heel hooks, some
    toe holds), can cause catastrophic damage before pain is fully felt.
  - Important distinctions:
    - Straight-line submissions (Achilles, many knee bars):
      - Pain often arrives earlier.
      - Escape routes more visually obvious.
    - Rotational submissions (heel hooks, some toe holds):
      - Joint structures can fail suddenly.
      - Defender may underestimate danger if unfamiliar.
  - The system assumes:
    - Safety is a technical skill that must be taught, not left to chance.
    - Training partners must build trust in leg entanglements in order to
      explore the system thoroughly.

- Communication protocols before and during rounds
  - Pre-round agreements:
    - Partners explicitly confirm:
      - Which submissions are live (e.g. “no heel hooks”, “all leg locks
        allowed”, “only straight ankle / toe hold”).
      - Intended intensity:
        - Technical flow.
        - Normal sparring.
        - Competition simulation.
    - Clarity reduces:
      - Misaligned expectations.
      - Panicked reactions when legs get entangled.
  - In-round communication:
    - “Stop” or “freeze” calls are always honoured:
      - If either partner feels unsafe or unsure.
      - If one player senses that the other does not understand what is
        happening to their leg.
    - After a freeze:
      - Briefly discuss position and mechanics.
      - Rewind to a safe checkpoint or restart the round.

- Phased technical progression for new leg-lock students
  - Phase 1 – Positional literacy and straight locks
    - Focus on:
      - Ashi as control and sweeping mechanism.
      - Knee-line and hip-line understanding.
      - Straight ankle (Achilles) mechanics with very conservative pressure.
    - No heel hooks; toe holds introduced only as low-intensity educational
      tools.
  - Phase 2 – Exposure to rotational mechanics with safety emphasis
    - Introduce:
      - Heel-hook positions and escapes conceptually.
      - Very slow, telegraphed heel-hook applications with pre-agreed “early
        tap” thresholds.
    - Emphasise:
      - Feeling the build-up of rotational tension.
      - Tapping at “first mechanical bite”, not at maximal pain.
  - Phase 3 – Integrated, higher-intensity training
    - Once students:
      - Demonstrate reliable tapping behaviour.
      - Show understanding of escapes and positional exits.
    - Then:
      - Introduce positional sparring with live heel hooks under supervision.
      - Competition-speed finishes reserved for:
        - Advanced rounds.
        - Partners who consent and understand the risk.

- Safety guidelines for instructors and training leaders
  - Monitoring pairings:
    - Avoid pairing:
      - High-intensity, leg-lock-savvy athletes with leg-lock novices at
        full speed.
      - Very large, strong beginners with small, advanced leg-lockers who
        might need to “let go” to stay safe.
  - Normalising early taps:
    - Coaches explicitly praise:
      - Early taps.
      - Conservative decisions in compromised positions.
    - Culture goal:
      - “Tap early, tap often” is viewed as intelligent, not weak.
  - Injury triage and debrief:
    - If an injury scare occurs (even if no injury):
      - Stop and discuss exactly what happened.
      - Identify:
        - Technical error (grip, angle, failure to reset).
        - Communication error (unclear rules, panic).
      - Adjust future training parameters to prevent repetition.

- Common safety pitfalls to avoid
  - Applying heel hooks at competition speed in normal rounds.
  - Cranking toe holds on partners who do not yet understand when to tap.
  - Continuing rotational pressure *after* a tap has started.
  - Laughing off near-injuries or blaming the injured partner instead of
    diagnosing the technical cause.


C.2 TRAINING DESIGN: FROM DRILLS TO SPARRING
-------------------------------------------

- Principle: “Design the round around the skill”
  - Rounds should be constructed to highlight specific leg-lock skills:
    - Knee-line retention.
    - Leg pummelling.
    - Following the leg through rolls.
    - Converting symmetric positions back to asymmetry.
  - For each training block:
    - Choose 1–2 primary skills.
    - Design:
      - Technical portion.
      - Drilling.
      - Positional sparring.
    - All to reinforce those same skills.

- Drill intensity ladder
  - Technical reps (0–20% resistance):
    - Focus:
      - Clean movement patterns.
      - Precise leg and hip placement.
    - No real resistance; partners are “cooperative mannequins”.
  - Progressive resistance drills (20–60%):
    - Defender:
      - Uses one or two scripted resistance patterns (e.g. only backing out,
        only rolling).
    - Attacker:
      - Must preserve structure and transition correctly, but pace is
        moderate.
  - Situational sparring (60–90%):
    - Start in defined Ashi or 50/50 / Mutual.
    - Both players:
      - Can use full defensive arsenal for that position.
      - Are still constrained to the scenario (e.g. must stay in leg
        entanglement until exit / finish).
  - Free sparring (variable intensity):
    - All positions are legal unless otherwise stated.
    - Goal:
      - Observe which elements of the system naturally appear.
      - Identify which Ashi hubs and submissions are actually dependable.

- Using constraints intelligently
  - “No submission, only control” constraints:
    - Force attacker to:
      - Value retention.
      - Practice leg switches and follow-the-leg behaviours.
    - Prevent over-fixation on taps.
  - “Three attacks then reset” constraints:
    - Encourage:
      - High-quality, chained submission attempts.
      - Acceptance of reset rather than forcing low-percentage fourth and
        fifth attempts.
  - “Leg-switch only” or “secondary-leg-only” constraints:
    - Require attacker to:
      - Transition off the primary leg once defender makes good progress.
      - Develop comfort attacking the “other side” without panic.

- Integrating leg locks with positional hierarchy
  - To avoid turning training into “leg locks or nothing”:
    - Mix rounds where:
      - Leg locks are the primary objective.
      - Leg locks are allowed but regarded as secondary to passing/back.
    - Example pattern:
      - Round 1: Leg-lock emphasis from guard.
      - Round 2: No leg locks; focus on passing and back takes.
      - Round 3: Free rules; connect both systems.


C.3 STRATEGIC INTEGRATION WITH THE BROADER GAME
-----------------------------------------------

- Leg locks as a subsystem, not a separate art
  - The system assumes:
    - You are still building competence in:
      - Guard retention.
      - Passing.
      - Back control.
      - Classic upper-body submissions.
  - Leg entanglements:
    - Plug into these existing skills rather than replacing them.
  - Examples:
    - Failed heel hook → opponent turns too far → back exposure.
    - Opponent hides legs too aggressively → passes become easier.

- Leg-to-pass connections
  - When opponent over-hides feet:
    - They often retract legs deeply under hips or over-rotate away from
      entanglements.
  - Attacker can:
    - Release Ashi at the correct moment.
    - Step into:
      - Body-lock style passing.
      - Knee-cut / smash passes.
    - Use partial leg-control grips to:
      - Prevent guard re-guarding.
      - Direct opponent into pre-favoured passing directions.

- Leg-to-back connections
  - Common pattern:
    - From Outside / Far-Hip Ashi:
      - Defender turns aggressively to free knee.
      - Their back begins to present.
  - Attacker:
    - Lets go of foot at the correct time.
    - Uses seat-belt, hip wedge or chair-sit mechanics to spin to back.
  - Emphasis:
    - Leg locks should *create* back-taking opportunities, not only taps.
    - Back control remains the most dominant scoring position in many
      rulesets.

- Choosing primary hubs for your personal game
  - Realistically, individual athletes will not specialise equally in all
    Ashi families.
  - Recommended approach:
    - Use the system to sample:
      - Irimi and Outside as basic hubs.
      - Cross / Inside as inverted-heel hubs.
      - 50/50 / Mutual as symmetric battlegrounds.
    - Then:
      - Identify the hubs where:
        - Control feels most natural.
        - Entries appear frequently in your matches.
        - You experience the fewest catastrophic reversals.
    - Make those hubs your “A-game”:
      - Direct training time there.
      - Build deeper branching and contingency plans from those positions.


C.4 OPPONENT PROFILES AND GAME-PLANNING
---------------------------------------

- Opponents with strong wrestling and top pressure
  - Characteristics:
    - Low stance, heavy hips.
    - Reluctant to pull guard.
  - Strategy:
    - Use:
      - Single-leg-X / Irimi entries off failed shots and sprawls.
      - Counter-wrestling that drops into Ashi rather than re-shooting.
    - Goal:
      - Make them pay for heavy stance by exposing front leg repeatedly.
      - Mix:
        - Immediate leg attacks.
        - Sweep-to-top sequences to discourage them from committing fully.

- Guard specialists with poor leg awareness
  - Characteristics:
    - Excellent grips and collar/sleeve attacks (in gi) or upper-body
      controls (no-gi).
    - Often leave feet close to hips or exposed in scrambles.
  - Strategy:
    - Use:
      - Quick Irimi or Outside Ashi entries from seated guard.
      - Pummelling under their legs whenever they post or tripod.
    - Aim:
      - Force them to respect legs and widen stance, breaking their guard
        structure.
      - Turn their guard into a more neutral, passing-friendly situation.

- Leg-lock-savvy opponents
  - Characteristics:
    - Understand Ashi structure and knee-line battles.
    - Comfortable in 50/50 / Mutual exchanges.
  - Strategy:
    - Place more emphasis on:
      - Winning pummelling battles rather than assuming structural
        ignorance.
      - Using Ashi to sweep and pass instead of forcing submissions when
        structure is not clearly superior.
    - Be prepared to:
      - Exit entanglements completely if both players are in true symmetry
        with no clear edge.
      - Re-enter from scenarios where you have obvious asymmetry.

- Spastic, explosive or “wild” grapplers
  - Characteristics:
    - Big, sudden movements.
    - Unpredictable spins, cartwheels or stands.
  - Strategy:
    - Use Ashi mainly as:
      - Control and sweeping.
      - Way to keep them “tethered” and reduce chaos.
    - When finishing:
      - Apply submissions slowly and clearly.
      - Prioritise positions where their ability to explode is limited
        (e.g. Far-Hip Ashi, solid Outside Ashi with strong hip wedges).


C.5 MENTAL MODELS AND COACHING CUES
-----------------------------------

- “Knee line first, everything else second”
  - Coaching emphasis:
    - Every time you think about adjusting grips, first check knee line.
    - If knee line is compromised:
      - Fix it or reset before hunting for submissions.
  - This mental model:
    - Reduces low-percentage finishing attempts.
    - Encourages structural awareness over hand-focused thinking.

- “Follow the leg, don’t chase the foot”
  - Cues:
    - Move your hips and torso with the defender’s hip line.
    - Do not rely solely on arm strength to keep the heel.
  - Outcome:
    - More stable transitions through rolls.
    - Better landings in Backside 50/50, Far-Hip and other hubs.

- “Control buys you time”
  - Teaching point:
    - When structure is good:
      - Defender must spend energy solving knee line and hip wedges.
      - Attacker has time to think, adjust and choose the correct
        submission path.
    - When structure is poor:
      - Time is against attacker, who must “race” against defender’s
        escapes.
  - Leg-lock mindset:
    - Always invest in structure early to “buy time” later.

- “Reset is not failure”
  - Many athletes:
    - Cling to a deteriorating Ashi because they feel they are “close”.
  - System perspective:
    - A clean reset to a strong Ashi, or even to neutral, is preferable to:
      - Being swept and passed.
      - Exposing your own feet in a mutual scramble.
  - Coaching cue:
    - “If you wouldn’t teach this position as a model to a beginner, do not
      finish from here – reset.”

- “Leg locks are a conversation, not a trap”
  - Concept:
    - Expect and plan for answers:
      - Escape attempts.
      - Rolls.
      - Re-pummels.
    - Each answer leads to another question (dilemma).
  - This framing:
    - Encourages athletes to build two- and three-step attack trees.
    - Reduces frustration when “first move” finishes do not succeed.


C.6 LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW
------------------------------------

- Tracking your own leg-lock data
  - Recommended simple log:
    - From each rolling session or block:
      - How many times did you enter Ashi?
      - Which Ashi families appeared most?
      - How many legitimate finishing attempts did you generate?
      - How many taps?
      - How many times did you lose position or get counter-leg-locked?
  - Use data to:
    - Identify which hubs are performing well.
    - Prioritise weak hubs or transitions in drilling.

- Periodic dedicated review weeks
  - After several months of regular training:
    - Run “review weeks” where:
      - Specific positions (e.g. only 50/50, only Cross Ashi) are emphasised.
      - Old notes and key concepts are revisited.
    - Refresh:
      - Core mechanical cues.
      - Dilemma structures.
      - Safety protocols.
  - Helps:
    - Prevent technical drift.
    - Recover details that may have been lost under pressure.

- Balancing leg-lock and non-leg-lock development
  - Long-term goal:
    - Become dangerous in leg entanglements.
    - Remain strong in the overall grappling game.
  - Practical suggestion:
    - Maintain minimum baseline:
      - 1–2 specific leg-lock-focused rounds per week.
      - 1–2 passing/back-focused rounds per week with no leg locks allowed.
    - Adjust ratio based on:
      - Upcoming competitions.
      - Personal technical goals.

ANNEX D: MASTER SYSTEM DIAGRAM
=============================

D.1 GLOBAL ASHI & DECISION FLOW (ASCII, ~80 CHAR WIDTH)
-------------------------------------------------------

High-level idea
- This diagram shows:
  - How you enter leg entanglements from neutral positions.
  - Which Ashi families act as main hubs.
  - How symmetric positions (50/50, Mutual Ashi) fit in.
  - Where and how submissions, sweeps and exits occur.
- Think of it as:
  - A map from “Neutral Grappling” → “Ashi Hubs” → “Finishes / Top Control”
    with symmetric detours and safety exits.

Explanation of key regions
--------------------------

- Neutral Game
  - All standard grappling phases:
    - Standing wrestling.
    - Guard exchanges.
    - Top vs guard situations.
  - Leg entries must plug into what you already do from these positions.

- Entries
  - Wrestling / top entries:
    - Countering shots by:
      - Sliding into Irimi Ashi when opponent’s leg is extended.
    - Entering Ashi off sprawls or snap-downs when opponent posts a leg.
  - Guard / seated entries:
    - Seated guard and open guard entries:
      - Shin-to-shin.
      - Single-leg-X style entries.
    - Immediate transition into Irimi or similar “entry Ashi” positions.

- Irimi Ashi and other entry Ashi
  - Irimi Ashi:
    - Central entry hub.
    - First “real” control of knee line and hips.
    - Where you concentrate on:
      - Stress tests (pulling back / pushing forward / rolling).
      - Building correct wedges.
      - Learning to follow the leg.
  - “Other entry Ashi”:
    - Situations where you may directly fall into Outside, 50/50 or Cross
      from scrambles, but Irimi is the canonical structured entry.

- Outside Ashi
  - Main asymmetrical finishing hub for outside heel hooks.
  - Key features:
    - Strong back-exposure denial.
    - Reliable, stress-tested control patterns (scissoring, cross-shin).
  - Relationship with Irimi:
    - Irimi → Outside is the standard structural upgrade once initial entry
      is secure.

- Cross / Inside Ashi
  - Cross / Inside Ashi:
    - High-power hubs for inverted and outside heel hooks.
    - Double-trouble possibilities with leg laces.
  - Accessed when:
    - Opponent turns to escape Outside Ashi.
    - Opponent high-legs or inverts and you follow correctly.
  - These positions:
    - Are more offensively loaded but have increased back-exposure risk if
      wedges are poor.

- Backside 50/50 and Far-Hip Ashi
  - Backside 50/50:
    - Offensive endpoint:
      - Your body rotated behind defender’s hip/knee.
      - Excellent inside-heel-hook platform.
    - Often comes from:
      - Following rolls out of Cross, Inside or 50/50.
  - Far-Hip Ashi:
    - Safety-oriented yet offensive:
      - Hides your own feet.
      - Controls far hip.
      - Allows measured heel or toe-hold attacks.
    - Frequently a target when:
      - Leaving symmetric danger.
      - Rebuilding safer positional dominance.

- Submission Tree and Sweep/Back Branch
  - Submission Tree node:
    - Represents all main submissions:
      - Inside / outside heel hooks (HH).
      - Toe holds (TOE).
      - Knee bars (KB).
      - Achilles (straight ankle).
    - Which branch you use depends on:
      - Ruleset.
      - Positional context.
      - Opponent reaction.
  - Sweep / Back Take node:
    - Even if submission is not (or cannot be) finished:
      - Break balance.
      - Use entanglement to sweep.
      - Convert over-rotations into back exposure.
    - Emphasises that:
      - Leg locks should improve overall position, not only chase taps.

- Top Ushiro / Passing Hubs and Pins
  - Top Ushiro / passing hubs:
    - Where leg entanglements feed into:
      - Strong top positions.
      - Passing sequences.
      - Back-take chains.
  - Pins / back control:
    - Final positional dominance in many rulesets.
    - The “positional” part of the leg-lock system:
      - As important as tapping opponents, especially in points formats.


D.2 SYMMETRIC DETOURS & RESET PATHS (ASCII, ~80 CHAR WIDTH)

                                                        v

                                                        v
                                             [OUTSIDE / CROSS / INSIDE]


Explanation
- Any Ashi can degrade into symmetric danger when:
  - You lose leg pummels.
  - You leave a leg behind during transitions.
  - Opponent deliberately steers toward 50/50 or Mutual Ashi.

- 50/50:
  - Requires:
    - Clear decision rules:
      - “Attack until you’re defending.”
      - Win inside knee and grip fights.
    - Use of:
      - Toe-hold / heel-hook dilemmas.
      - Separation mechanics to break semi-sankaku.

- Mutual Ashi:
  - Demands:
    - “Go last” mindset:
      - Hide your heel before attacking.
      - Seek Far-Hip or other safe partial exits.
    - Use of:
      - Toe holds, knee bars.
      - Double trouble and far-hip transitions.

- Backside 50/50 and Far-Hip Ashi:
  - Represent:
    - Asymmetric “resolutions” of symmetric danger.
  - Once there:
    - Return to the main asymmetrical hub network:
      - Outside Ashi.
      - Cross / Inside Ashi.
      - Or keep finishing directly from Backside / Far-Hip.

                               [RE-ENTER]


Explanation
- Messy / low-control entanglement:
  - When:
    - Knee line is clearly slipping.
    - Hips are far away.
    - You cannot identify clear wedges.
    - Opponent is close to counter-leg-locking you.

- Exit to guard:
  - Preferred when:
    - You can frame and recover legs between you and opponent.
    - You want to immediately rebuild from bottom.
  - Use:
    - Frames on hips or shoulders.
    - Leg pummels into open/closed/seated guard.

- Exit to stand:
  - Preferred when:
    - You can safely post and stand without exposing back.
    - You want to reset to wrestling or outside passing range.
  - Use:
    - Technical stand-ups.
    - Collar/armpit/head control (if available) to slow opponent.

- Re-entering on your terms:
  - After safe exit:
    - Rebuild structure from a position you understand deeply.
    - Re-approach entries (Irimi / Outside) with:
      - Better angles.
      - Fresh grips.
      - Clearer game plan.


D.3 FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY OF THE MASTER DIAGRAM
--------------------------------------------

- Core strategic messages encoded in the diagram
  - You want:
    - To spend most of your leg-lock game in asymmetrical hubs:
      - Irimi.
      - Outside.
      - Cross / Inside.
      - Backside 50/50.
      - Far-Hip Ashi.
    - To treat symmetric hubs:
      - 50/50.
      - Mutual Ashi.
      - As transient environments to be solved and left.
  - You must:
    - Continuously track knee line and hip line.
    - Know how to follow rolls and when to reset.
    - Maintain a clear distinction between:
      - Offence-first behaviours (when you hold structural advantage).
      - Defence-first behaviours (when you do not).

- Practical coaching use
  - Use the diagram to:
    - Plan drilling blocks:
      - One week per “major arrow” (e.g. Irimi → Outside, Outside → Cross).
      - One week per “danger zone” (e.g. 50/50 / Mutual).
    - Explain to students:
      - Why certain positions are preferred.
      - Why others are only visited briefly.
    - Diagnose rolling footage:
      - Mark where specific matches live in the diagram.
      - Identify whether the athlete:
        - Reaches the intended hubs.
        - Gets stuck in symmetric detours.
        - Fails to use exits or resets.

- Mindset encoded by the diagram
  - Control-centric:
    - Submissions are branches off stable hubs, not isolated moves.
  - Directional:
    - There is a “flow” to the system:
      - Neutral → Entry → Hub → Higher Hub → Finish / Sweep → Top.
  - Safety-aware:
    - Symmetric danger and structural breakdown have explicit exit routes.
    - Protecting knees and training partners is built into the architecture.

ANNEX E: COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS
==============================

E.1 STRUCTURAL AND POSITIONAL ERRORS
------------------------------------

- Losing the knee line while still “finishing”
  - Description:
    - Attacker continues cranking Achilles, toe holds or heel hooks even
      though the defender’s knee has already slid past the hip line.
  - Symptoms:
    - Defender can look directly at attacker while leg is being attacked.
    - Defender’s knee is closer to their own chest than to attacker’s hips.
    - Break attempts feel “weak” and mostly attack the foot, not the knee.
  - Consequences:
    - Very low finishing percentage on skilled opponents.
    - Wasted energy and grip fatigue.
    - Easy, low-risk escapes for defender.
  - Corrections:
    - Hard rule: if knee line is lost, stop attacking and either:
      - Re-capture knee line with wedges and hip movement.
      - Or exit and reset to guard/stand.
    - Build reflex:
      - “No knee line, no break; fix position before pulling.”

- Hips too far away from the defender
  - Description:
    - Attacker’s hips drift away from defender’s hips during Ashi exchanges.
  - Symptoms:
    - Large gap between pelvises.
    - Attacker lying flat on back, spine extended, legs reaching for the
      opponent.
    - Defender can freely turn and sit up without significant resistance.
  - Consequences:
    - Loss of control and knee line.
    - Increased chance of being stacked or passed.
    - Weak finishing mechanics (lever arm too long, no core engagement).
  - Corrections:
    - Emphasise drills where:
      - Hips are actively “chasing” the defender’s hip line.
      - Attacker re-centres chest and closes distance every time defender
        retreats.
    - Coaching cue:
      - “Shorten the chain” – bring hips to the knee, not knee to your feet.

- Ignoring the far leg
  - Description:
    - Attacker fixates on the trapped leg and leaves the far leg free.
  - Symptoms:
    - Defender repeatedly posts with far foot to stand up or spin.
    - Defender uses far leg to push off attacker’s hips or face.
  - Consequences:
    - Defender stands to escape or dive into passing.
    - Ashi is stripped off and attacker ends underneath or turtled.
  - Corrections:
    - Build habit:
      - Always ask “where is the far leg?” when you enter Ashi.
    - Use:
      - Far-hip hooks.
      - Secondary-leg clamps.
      - Hand control on far ankle when appropriate.
    - Include specific drills where:
      - Defender’s primary goal is to use far leg to escape.
      - Attacker’s goal is to nullify it before attacking submissions.

- Poor head and chest orientation (back exposure)
  - Description:
    - Attacker allows their chest to face away from defender’s hips,
      opening back-take routes.
  - Symptoms:
    - Defender begins to appear “behind” attacker in scrambles.
    - Attacker uses extended, twisting shapes to hold leg.
  - Consequences:
    - Back takes off stalled heel hooks.
    - Loss of positional advantage and potential choke risk.
  - Corrections:
    - Repeated recentering:
      - “If you can’t see their beltline with your chest, you are turning
        too far.”
    - Drills where:
      - Defender’s main objective is to take back whenever attacker over-
        rotates.
      - Attacker’s graded task is to:
        - Follow leg.
        - Then recenter chest as soon as roll finishes.

- Over-reliance on upper-body strength
  - Description:
    - Attacker tries to finish predominantly with arm power and shoulder
      shrugging.
  - Symptoms:
    - Arms shaking while hips are passive.
    - Minimal change in pressure when attacker attempts to “squeeze harder”.
  - Consequences:
    - Rapid fatigue.
    - Weak submissions, especially on strong or flexible opponents.
  - Corrections:
    - Mechanical focus:
      - Hips and core generate main force.
      - Arms and grip are mainly for direction and fine control.
    - Drills:
      - “No-hands structure tests”:
        - Build Ashi.
        - Let go with hands for 1–2 seconds.
        - Position should remain fundamentally stable.


E.2 TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC ERRORS
---------------------------------

- Living voluntarily in symmetric positions
  - Description:
    - Attacker intentionally sits in 50/50 or Mutual Ashi for long periods
      without clear plan to exit or attack first.
  - Symptoms:
    - Extended stalemates where both players hold feet but do little.
    - Frequent double-attacks where both players heel hook each other.
  - Consequences:
    - High risk of leg injuries for both players.
    - Matches decided by who is more reckless instead of who is better.
  - Corrections:
    - Strategic rule:
      - Symmetric positions are to be:
        - Solved (win initiative, make them move).
        - Or left (shift to Far-Hip / Backside / exit).
    - Use decision trees:
      - 50/50:
        - “Attack until you’re defending.”
      - Mutual Ashi:
        - “Go last” – protect your heel first, then transition out.

- Attacking when you should still be defending
  - Description:
    - In 50/50 / Mutual Ashi, attacker launches aggressive submissions
      before ensuring own heel is safe.
  - Symptoms:
    - Both players entangle heels simultaneously.
    - Attacker often tapped while believing they are attacking.
  - Consequences:
    - Double-taps or attacker losing exchanges they initiated.
    - Reduced trust in leg entanglements as a strategic choice.
  - Corrections:
    - Slight delay rule:
      - First 1–2 seconds in symmetric positions:
        - Focus purely on heel safety (hiding feet, far-hip, inside knee).
      - Only then initiate offence.
    - Drills:
      - Symmetric start where:
        - One point is awarded for demonstrating clean heel safety before
          any attack.

- Forcing submissions from clearly lost positions
  - Description:
    - Attacker refuses to abandon an obviously deteriorated Ashi and
      continues to crank.
  - Symptoms:
    - Knee line partly or fully lost.
    - Hips misaligned, defender rising to pass.
    - Attacker still tugging on heel or toes.
  - Consequences:
    - Low-value taps (if any).
    - High probability of reversal, guard pass or counter-leg-lock.
  - Corrections:
    - Clear coaching threshold:
      - “If you would not teach this position as a model, do not finish
        from here.”
    - Incorporate “reset points”:
      - Specific positions where:
        - If reached, attacker must reset to guard or stand instead of
          continuing.

- One-dimensional leg-lock strategy
  - Description:
    - Attacker pursues leg locks from everywhere and neglects sweeps,
      passes, and back takes.
  - Symptoms:
    - Repeatedly falls back on legs from dominant top positions.
    - Gives up pins or back control to chase ankles and heels.
  - Consequences:
    - Predictability:
      - Opponents know exactly what is coming.
    - Poor performance in rulesets where positional control scores higher.
  - Corrections:
    - Integrate:
      - “Leg or back” decision rule:
        - When opponent turns too far, switch to back.
        - When opponent hides legs by retracting, switch to passes.
    - Training split:
      - Alternate rounds:
        - Leg-lock-emphasis rounds.
        - “No-leg-lock” rounds focusing only on passing/back control.

- Misaligned risk relative to scoreboard and ruleset
  - Description:
    - Attacker chooses high-variance leg-lock shootouts when already ahead
      on points, or avoids leg locks entirely when behind.
  - Symptoms:
    - Losing matches by gambling from 50/50 while leading.
    - Failing to attempt high-value submissions when time is short.
  - Consequences:
    - Underperformance relative to technical ability.
    - Tactical inconsistency.
  - Corrections:
    - Pre-match scripts:
      - “If up on points”:
        - Use Ashi for sweeps and control.
        - Avoid symmetric shootouts unless very confident.
      - “If down on points or in submission-only”:
        - Accept more symmetric risk in late stages.
    - Scenario rounds:
      - Run time/score-specific drills to embed decisions.


E.3 TRAINING, CULTURE AND MINDSET ERRORS
----------------------------------------

- Competition-speed heel hooks in standard training
  - Description:
    - Partners apply full, sudden rotational pressure during normal
      sparring.
  - Symptoms:
    - Training partners visibly frightened of leg entanglements.
    - Frequent “near injury” stories or actual injuries.
  - Consequences:
    - Partners avoid leg entanglements altogether.
    - Skill development stagnates due to lack of realistic reps.
  - Corrections:
    - Culture:
      - Heel hooks applied with clear, progressive pressure.
      - Fast finishing reserved for:
        - Advanced partners.
        - Explicitly agreed rounds.
    - Coaching:
      - Immediate intervention when:
        - Anyone cranks heel hooks or toe holds irresponsibly.

- Normalising late taps and “tough guy” behaviour
  - Description:
    - Students praised for refusing to tap or trying to “tank” submissions.
  - Symptoms:
    - People twisting and rolling long after heel/ankle alignment is gone.
    - Partners priding themselves on “not tapping to leg locks”.
  - Consequences:
    - Knee and ankle injuries.
    - Poor technical understanding of safe thresholds.
  - Corrections:
    - Explicit coaching:
      - Praise early tap behaviour.
      - Use technical language:
        - “Tap at mechanical failure onset, not at maximal pain.”
    - Video review:
      - Show slow-motion of catastrophic breaks to illustrate risk.

- Neglecting defensive training
  - Description:
    - Classroom time focused almost exclusively on entries and finishes,
      not on escapes and resets.
  - Symptoms:
    - Students comfortable attacking, but panicky when trapped.
    - Few people know how to safely exit Cross / 50/50 / Mutual Ashi.
  - Consequences:
    - Training room “arms race” where:
      - Everyone attacks.
      - Few know how to survive.
  - Corrections:
    - Defensive quotas:
      - At least:
        - One session per block devoted to defensive structure and exits.
      - Regular positional rounds where:
        - One side is purely defensive for first 50% of time.
    - Logging:
      - Track how often students escape vs get tapped in entanglements.

- No structured reflection or note-taking
  - Description:
    - Athletes rely on vague memory of which leg-lock exchanges succeed or
      fail.
  - Symptoms:
    - Same mistakes reappear across months.
    - Technical plateaus in specific Ashi families.
  - Consequences:
    - Slow improvement curve.
    - Difficulty tailoring training blocks to actual needs.
  - Corrections:
    - Simple leg-lock log:
      - After training, quickly note:
        - Which Ashi appeared.
        - Where control was lost.
        - What submissions worked or failed.
    - Periodic review:
      - Use log to decide:
        - Next month’s technical focus.
        - Which hubs require deeper drilling.

- Treating leg locks as isolated “tricks”
  - Description:
    - Students view leg locks as one-off moves rather than part of a
      structured positional system.
  - Symptoms:
    - Random dives at legs from poor positions.
    - No consistent transitions between Ashi families.
  - Consequences:
    - Low consistency.
    - Strong opponents easily counter and stabilise.
  - Corrections:
    - Constant reinforcement of:
      - Ashi hierarchy.
      - Positional flow (Irimi → Outside → Cross/Inside → Backside/Far-Hip).
    - Teaching:
      - Always present leg-locks as branches of the larger system diagram,
        not stand-alone techniques.


E.4 DIAGNOSTICS AND FIX-THE-ERROR PATTERNS
------------------------------------------

- Diagnostic 1 – “Where did the knee line go?”
  - After any failed leg-lock attempt:
    - Ask:
      - “At what exact moment did I lose the knee line?”
      - “What was I doing with my hips and wedges at that time?”
  - Correction pattern:
    - Rebuild sequence in slow drilling:
      - Freeze at the moment knee line starts to slip.
      - Insert:
        - Hip chase.
        - Re-wedge.
        - Or tactical exit.

- Diagnostic 2 – “Was I in symmetry when tapped?”
  - If you are heel-hooked or foot-locked:
    - Ask:
      - “Was I in 50/50 or Mutual Ashi?”
      - “Did I protect my own heel before attacking?”
  - Correction pattern:
    - Add specific symmetric-position rounds where:
      - You must:
        - First build heel safety.
        - Only then attack.
      - Score negative if you attack first while your own heel is exposed.

- Diagnostic 3 – “Did I follow the leg or chase the foot?”
  - For rolling scrambles ending badly:
    - Ask:
      - “Did I move my hips and shoulders with their hip line?”
      - Or “Was I just pulling on the foot with my arms?”
  - Correction pattern:
    - Use “follow-the-roll” drills where:
      - Defender performs set number of rolls.
      - Attacker’s task is purely:
        - Maintain chest/hip proximity.
        - Land in stable hub, not necessarily finish.

- Diagnostic 4 – “Did I have a second move prepared?”
  - After any leg-lock exchange:
    - Ask:
      - “Did I have at least one planned follow-up if first attack failed?”
  - Correction pattern:
    - Train all submissions as dilemmas:
      - Achilles → heel hook.
      - Toe hold → knee bar / heel hook.
      - Heel hook → follow roll → new Ashi.
    - Remove single-move drills from advanced practice.

- Diagnostic 5 – “Was staying here strategically correct?”
  - Before blaming technique:
    - Ask:
      - “Given time, score and ruleset, was it wise to remain in this
        position?”
  - Correction pattern:
    - Integrate:
      - Time/score constraints into positional rounds.
    - Practice:
      - Recognising when:
        - To stay and attack.
        - To exit to guard or stand.
        - To prioritise sweep/back over submission.
