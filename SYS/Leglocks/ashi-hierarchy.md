# System: Ashi Hierarchy and Hub Network

## Purpose
- Provide a single operating map for leg-lock positional navigation: **entry → control hub → escalation hub → finish / sweep / exit**.
- Maintain a consistent strategic bias toward **asymmetry** (clean attacking advantage) and away from prolonged **symmetry** (mutual danger).
- Standardise decision-making around:
  - **Knee-line control** as the primary success condition.
  - **Hip control / back-exposure denial** as the primary safety condition.
  - **Follow-the-leg + leg switching** as the primary continuity skill under rolls/scrambles.

## Key Positions
- **Neutral domains**
  - Standing / wrestling exchanges
  - Guard / seated entries
  - Top vs guard and scrambles
- **Entry hubs**
  - **Irimi Ashi** (default structured entry)
  - “Other entry Ashi” (situational direct falls into Outside / 50/50 / Cross off scrambles)
- **Asymmetrical control hubs (preferred “homes”)**
  - **Outside Ashi** (hip control + back-exposure denial; strong finishing platform)
  - **Cross Ashi** (high-offence inverted hub; integrates two-leg control; higher back-exposure risk if loose)
  - **Inside Ashi** (cross-like structure oriented for outside heel exposure / finishing)
- **Escalation / endpoint hubs (high-offence or high-safety)**
  - **Backside 50/50** (offensive resolution of entanglement; strong heel exposure; limited defensive rotations)
  - **Far-Hip Ashi** (safety shell that still attacks; protects your feet while keeping control)
  - **Top Ushiro** (top control outcome from entanglements; multiple finishing lines + back/passing routes)
- **Symmetrical battlegrounds (transient)**
  - **50/50** (inside-knee + grip initiative; requires rapid separation logic)
  - **Mutual Ashi** (outside-heel-hook shootout zone; requires “go last” heel-safety-first discipline)
- **Outcome nodes**
  - **Submissions:** heel hooks (inside/outside), toe holds, Achilles locks, knee bars
  - **Positional conversions:** sweep to top, back exposure/back take, passing hubs
  - **Safety exits:** exit to guard, exit to stand, reset and re-enter

## Key Cues
- **Global strategic rules**
  - Prefer **asymmetry**: aim to spend most time in Outside / Cross / Inside / Backside / Far-Hip / Ushiro.
  - Treat **symmetry** (50/50, Mutual) as a **problem to solve**, not a place to live.
- **Primary control conditions**
  - **Knee line first:** if the knee line is not owned, prioritise re-wedging / hip-chasing / re-pummelling over finishing pressure.
  - **Hips close:** shorten distance; extended hips make retention and finishing unreliable.
  - **Far leg is never “free”:** track and manage the non-target leg to prevent stands, heists, and re-pummels.
- **Transition triggers (simple if/then)**
  - Opponent **backs out** → chase hips + re-wedge; re-establish entry hub (often Irimi) or upgrade to Outside.
  - Opponent **drives forward** → switch to structures that deny crush and preserve wedges (Post/Butterfly-type responses, then upgrade).
  - Opponent **high-legs / steps over** → re-capture with hip angle + cross-shin/scissoring logic; transition to stronger hub if needed.
  - Opponent **rolls / spins** → *follow the leg*; land in Cross/Inside or Backside/Far-Hip rather than accepting random shapes.
  - Opponent **re-pummels** → win inside position back; either re-enter asymmetry or accept brief symmetry then exit.
- **Symmetry management rules**
  - **50/50:** “attack until you’re defending” (initiative matters); inside-knee + separation mechanics decide the exchange.
  - **Mutual Ashi:** “go last” (heel safety first); force reactions with fast-onset threats and exit to Far-Hip / Outside / Cross.
- **Reset rules**
  - If you cannot clearly name:
    - where the knee line is,
    - what wedge is holding it,
    - and how your back is protected,
    - then **reset** (re-centre, simplify to a reliable hub, or exit to guard/stand).

## Drills & Games
- **Hub map flow (low intensity)**
  - Neutral → Irimi → Outside → Cross/Inside → Backside 50/50 / Far-Hip → finish or sweep → top Ushiro → reset.
- **Transition ladders (scripted)**
  - Irimi → Outside (on cue)
  - Outside → Cross/Inside (on “turn/high-leg” cue)
  - Cross/Inside → Backside 50/50 (on “roll” cue)
  - 50/50 → Backside or Far-Hip (on “separate” cue)
  - Mutual → Far-Hip exit (on “heel exposure” cue)
- **Stress-test circuit (positional validation)**
  - Start in each main hub; defender cycles: back-out → forward pressure → roll → re-pummel; attacker must maintain wedges or transition cleanly.
- **Follow-the-roll rounds**
  - Defender performs 1–3 controlled rolls; attacker must stay glued and land in a pre-chosen hub (Backside/Far-Hip/Outside/Cross).
- **Symmetry resolution games**
  - 50/50: score for (a) inside-knee win, (b) clean separation, (c) exit to asymmetry; penalise passive stalling.
  - Mutual Ashi: first 2 seconds are “heel safety only” before any offence; score for safe exit to asymmetry.
- **Reset training**
  - Begin in “messy entanglement”; attacker must choose the correct exit (guard/stand) and re-enter with structure, not force.

## Common Mistakes
- **Living in symmetry** (50/50 or Mutual) without a fast plan to separate/extract to asymmetry.
- **Chasing the foot instead of following the leg** (arm-pulling while hips drift away).
- **Finishing while knee line is lost** (cranking on a structurally freed leg).
- **Hips too far / posture too extended**, making wedges weak and transitions late.
- **Ignoring the far leg**, allowing stands, heists, or re-pummels that strip control.
- **Back exposure in Cross/Inside transitions** due to poor chest/hip orientation and loose wedges.
- **Attacking first in Mutual Ashi** without heel safety (“go last” violation).
- **Failure to reset** when the position becomes unidentifiable; forcing low-percentage finishes instead of rebuilding.

## Personal Notes
- Preferred “A-game” hubs (rank):  
- Most common entry you actually hit live:  
- Most frequent failure point (knee line, far leg, back exposure, symmetry stall):  
- One transition to hard-wire next block:  
- Safety constraints to enforce in training (partners/rules/pace):
