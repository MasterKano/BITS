# System: Irimi Ashi Garami (Entry Hub)

## Purpose
- Establish the **default first entanglement** for a structured leg-entry: capture the knee line, stabilise hips, and create immediate threat.
- Function as a **control hub** (not a finish-only position): hold the leg through common escape directions, then **upgrade** to stronger hubs (Outside / Butterfly / Post / Cross transitions as dictated by reactions).
- Build the first “dilemma engine” (most commonly Achilles pressure to force reactions that expose heel or open transitions).

## Key Positions
- **Irimi Ashi baseline structure**
  - Primary leg trapped with knees pinched and hips close enough that defender cannot simply “walk the knee out.”
  - Secondary leg has a job (monitor far leg / block stand-up / control hip line) rather than floating.
- **Irimi with Achilles control (as tether)**
  - Used to stabilise and slow the defender while you re-angle, re-pummel, or follow initial rotations.
- **Irimi connectors**
  - **Butterfly Ashi link**: mobility and re-angle option when defender drives forward, stands, or you need a cleaner transition.
  - **Post Ashi link**: response to posting/standing/forward pressure where you need a posting wedge to keep knee line.
  - **Irimi → Outside upgrade**: standard progression once you have stability and/or heel exposure begins to appear.

## Key Cues
- **Knee line first**
  - If the defender’s knee is not deeply controlled relative to your hip line, treat everything else as secondary; fix position before “finishing.”
- **Hips close, not extended**
  - Your pelvis should chase their hip line; long-legged, stretched positions trade control for false grip confidence.
- **Far leg awareness**
  - The far leg is the escape engine (post to stand, push hips, re-pummel). Assign a control solution early rather than reacting late.
- **Stress-test before committing**
  - Quickly test whether the structure survives:
    - straight-back extraction,
    - forward pressure,
    - initial rotation/roll tendency,
    - re-pummelling attempts.
  - If it fails a test, adjust legs/hip angle first; do not “muscle” a submission to compensate.
- **Follow the leg, don’t chase the foot**
  - When they rotate/roll, move your hips and torso with their hip line; preserve wedges and aim to land in a better hub.
- **Upgrade mindset**
  - Irimi is often the *entry*, not the final home: if the defender starts solving it (high-leg, posture, forward pressure), transition decisively to the correct connector or stronger hub.

## Drills & Games
- **Irimi build + four-direction stress test**
  - Start in Irimi; defender cycles (light-to-moderate): back-out → forward pressure → turn/roll → re-pummel.
  - Attacker goal: keep knee line and structure using minimal hand strength; reset if structure degrades.
- **Irimi “freeze checks”**
  - Enter Irimi, then freeze at 3 checkpoints:
    1) hips close / knee line secure,
    2) far leg assigned and controlled,
    3) ready-to-upgrade angle (Outside/Butterfly/Post).
- **Irimi → Outside on cue**
  - Coach clap: immediate clean upgrade without losing knee line; repeat in both directions/legs.
- **Achilles-as-tether flow**
  - Apply light Achilles control to slow movement, then transition on defender’s reaction:
    - heel exposure appears → switch to heel control pathway,
    - defender turns/rolls → follow and re-entangle,
    - defender posts/stands → Post/Butterfly connector.
- **“No finish” retention rounds**
  - 1–2 minute rounds starting in Irimi where submissions are disallowed; score only for maintaining knee line and achieving a clean upgrade to Outside.

## Common Mistakes
- Entering Irimi and immediately chasing the foot while the **knee line is not owned**.
- Letting the **far leg float**, then being surprised when the defender posts/stands/re-pummels.
- Staying flat and extended (hips far), then losing control to back-out or forward pressure.
- Trying to “win” with grip strength instead of correcting leg wedges and hip angle.
- Failing to commit to upgrades (hesitating between Irimi and Outside/Butterfly/Post until the defender clears the knee).
