# System: Outside Ashi Garami (Primary Asymmetrical Finishing Hub)

## Purpose
- Establish a **stable asymmetrical leg entanglement** that denies back exposure while creating reliable heel/toe/ankle attack pathways.
- Serve as the main “home base” after entry (commonly upgraded from Irimi) where you can **stress-test control**, expose the heel methodically, and finish without sacrificing structure.
- Provide a robust framework to handle common defensive reactions (high-leg, kneeling/turning, rolls) while maintaining knee-line dominance.

## Key Positions
- **Outside Ashi baseline**
  - Asymmetrical orientation with leg configuration built to clamp hip rotation and trap the knee line.
- **Leg-scissor hip clamp**
  - Scissoring legs around the trapped thigh/hip line to restrict turning and prevent defender from getting behind you.
- **Cross-shin control**
  - Shin placed across waist/hip line to reinforce hip control, re-capture high-leg attempts, and stabilise angles.
- **Outside Ashi to belly-down exposure**
  - Rotational follow-through into belly-down variants when the defender rolls or when angle improves breaking leverage.
- **Outside Ashi to connectors**
  - Transition pathways into Cross/Inside Ashi when defender turns/high-legs/inverts; or into higher-offence hubs (Backside 50/50 / Far-Hip) when rolls create the opening.

## Key Cues
- **Back-exposure denial is non-negotiable**
  - Keep chest and hip orientation disciplined; if you can’t keep safe alignment, re-centre or transition rather than forcing a finish.
- **Knee line stays captured during every adjustment**
  - Any grip change or heel hunt must preserve wedges; if knee line starts to clear, prioritise re-wedging immediately.
- **Scissor + cross-shin = hip control**
  - Scissor clamps rotation; cross-shin redirects hip movement and punishes high-leg attempts.
- **High-leg is a trigger, not a problem**
  - Treat high-leg as a predictable reaction that cues:
    - re-trap the knee line with scissor/cross-shin,
    - optionally threaten toe hold to force compliance and expose heel.
- **Roll-following with structure**
  - When the defender rolls: stay glued to the leg, rotate with the hip line, and land in a pre-planned hub (Outside again, Cross/Inside, Backside, Far-Hip) rather than accepting random shapes.
- **Achilles as control / heel hook as escalation**
  - Use Achilles pressure to tether and create movement; escalate to heel control when exposure is forced and structure is secure.

## Drills & Games
- **Outside Ashi stress-test circuit**
  - Start in Outside; defender cycles: high-leg → kneel/turn → controlled roll(s).
  - Attacker goal: maintain knee line and back-safety while re-establishing heel exposure each time.
- **High-leg response ladder**
  - Defender repeatedly high-legs; attacker must:
    - re-capture with scissor/cross-shin,
    - then choose: heel exposure track OR toe-hold threat track (light, technical).
- **Belly-up ↔ belly-down transition reps**
  - From stable Outside, rotate to belly-down exposure and return, keeping knee line and hip clamp intact throughout.
- **Follow-the-roll from Outside**
  - Defender performs 1–3 controlled rolls; attacker must stay attached and finish in a stable entanglement (Outside/Cross/Backside).
- **Kneeling opponent scenario**
  - Defender starts on knees; attacker in Outside must maintain hip control and either expose heel or convert to sweep/top.

## Common Mistakes
- Losing hip clamp while chasing heel, creating **back exposure**.
- Allowing the defender to clear the knee line because the scissor/cross-shin wedges were not maintained during transitions.
- Treating high-leg as “panic” instead of a scripted trigger for re-capture and toe-hold/heel-exposure options.
- Rolling with the foot (arm pull) instead of moving hips/torso with the defender’s rotation (disconnecting from knee line).
- Staying in Outside when the defender’s reaction clearly calls for a cleaner transition to Cross/Inside or Backside/Far-Hip.

## Personal Notes
- My best Outside Ashi entry (from Irimi / scrambles):  
- My highest-percentage heel exposure pattern (cross-shin / belly-down / post-feet):  
- My most common failure (how back exposure happens):  
- My default response to high-leg:  
- My cleanest transition out of Outside (to Cross/Inside / Backside / Far-Hip):
