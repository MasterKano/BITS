# System: Far-Hip Ashi (Safety Shell + Asymmetry Rebuild)

## Purpose
- Provide a **safer asymmetrical** leg-entanglement structure that prioritises **hiding your own feet** while maintaining credible offence.
- Act as a primary “exit/upgrade” from **symmetric danger** (especially 50/50 and Mutual Ashi) back into asymmetry.
- Stabilise control during scrambles/roll-following when standard hubs (Outside/Cross/50-50) become unsafe or too mirrored.

## Key Positions
- **Far-Hip Ashi base (safety shell)**
  - Far-hip control used to limit defender hip rotation and reduce access to the attacker’s own heels.
- **Far-Hip off 50/50 separation**
  - Conversion route after legs open or inside-knee battles stabilise; used to break the mirrored exchange.
- **Far-Hip off Mutual Ashi “go last”**
  - First priority configuration to protect your own heel before initiating major offence.
- **Far-Hip as roll-follow landing**
  - Arrival position when defender rolls/spins hard and you choose safety + control over chasing a specific finish.
- **Far-Hip ↔ Backside 50/50**
  - Two-way linkage:
    - Far-Hip for safety and re-asymmetrisation,
    - Backside for high-offence when exposure becomes clean.

## Key Cues
- **Heel safety first**
  - Build Far-Hip when you sense mirrored danger; do not initiate big attacks if your own heel is accessible.
- **Control the hip to control the leg**
  - The far-hip connection is the anchor; if you lose hip control, the defender regains turning/spinning options.
- **Use Far-Hip to “reset the exchange”**
  - Treat it as a structural reset that buys time to re-pummel, re-align, and choose a better finishing hub.
- **Attack while insulated**
  - Offence should occur without sacrificing the safety shell; if you must “open up” to attack, do it knowingly and with pre-planned transitions.
- **Transition rule**
  - If you can’t clearly define wedges + heel safety, default to Far-Hip rather than forcing a finish from symmetry.

## Drills & Games
- **50/50 → Far-Hip conversion drill**
  - Start in standard 50/50; attacker’s goal is to separate legs and settle Far-Hip without exposing own heel.
- **Mutual Ashi “go last” → Far-Hip first drill**
  - Start in Mutual Ashi; attacker must build Far-Hip safety shell for 3–5 seconds before any attack.
- **Far-Hip stabilisation (no finish)**
  - Attacker holds Far-Hip against defender’s scripted reactions: roll, spin, post, re-pummel.
- **Far-Hip to high-offence upgrade**
  - From stable Far-Hip, attacker transitions into Backside 50/50 or Outside/Cross hub when defender’s reactions create clean exposure.

## Common Mistakes
- Treating Far-Hip as purely defensive and stalling instead of using it to create controlled transitions.
- Losing the far-hip connection while chasing the heel, allowing defender to spin or re-enter symmetry.
- Over-opening legs/hips to attack and re-exposing your own heels, recreating the original problem.
- “Chasing the foot” instead of maintaining hip control and letting exposure develop through constrained rotation.

## Personal Notes
- My best Far-Hip entry (from which hub / which reaction):  
- My highest-confidence follow-up (Backside / Outside / finish choice):  
- My most common failure point (loss of hip connection, inside-knee battle, etc.):
