# System: Backside 50/50 (High-Offence Asymmetry Upgrade)

## Purpose
- Convert 50/50-type exchanges into a **more asymmetrical, attacker-favoured** configuration with improved heel exposure and constrained defender rotations.
- Act as a primary “upgrade hub” after **following rolls** from Cross/Inside Ashi or standard 50/50.
- Provide a stable platform for decisive finishing and structured follow-ups when standard entanglements become symmetric or unstable.

## Key Positions
- **Backside 50/50 base**
  - Attacker’s body orientation rotates “behind” the defender’s knee/hip line, tightening the attacker’s alignment to the defender’s knee.
- **Backside entry off roll-following**
  - Common arrival point after defender rolls out of Cross/Inside or standard 50/50.
- **Backside with inside-knee advantage**
  - Priority to secure inside-knee positioning and control that limits defender’s ability to pummel back to symmetry.
- **Backside ↔ Far-Hip transitions**
  - Used when defender’s counters increase exposure to the attacker’s own feet; Far-Hip becomes safety shell or re-asymmetrisation.
- **Backside → finish / sweep-to-top**
  - Platform not only for submissions but also for sweeps and transitions into top control outcomes.

## Key Cues
- **“Land in a hub, not in a scramble”**
  - When following a roll, aim to settle into Backside 50/50 deliberately rather than accepting random leg positions.
- **Knee-line and hip-line stacking**
  - Reinforce that Backside is still a knee-line game: clamp, wedge, and keep the defender’s knee captured before escalating.
- **Break symmetry immediately**
  - If you enter any 50/50-like exchange, treat Backside as a preferred route to remove the mirrored danger.
- **Heel exposure through constrained rotation**
  - Use body alignment (not grip strength) to limit defender’s hip turns, creating stable heel visibility.
- **Protect your own feet while attacking**
  - Even in Backside, monitor your heel exposure; use re-wedging or transitions (Far-Hip, Outside/Cross re-entry) if your feet become accessible.

## Drills & Games
- **Follow-the-roll → Backside landing drill**
  - Start in Cross/Inside or standard 50/50; defender performs a controlled roll; attacker must follow and “stick the landing” in Backside 50/50.
- **Backside stabilisation reps (no finish)**
  - Attacker must hold Backside with clean knee-line control for a set time before attempting any submission mechanics.
- **Backside decision rounds**
  - Start in Backside; attacker must choose one of three outcomes:
    - Finish (if clean exposure exists),
    - Transition to Far-Hip (if own feet at risk),
    - Sweep to top and stabilise.
- **Backside vs re-pummel game**
  - Defender’s only goal is to pummel legs back toward symmetry; attacker’s goal is to maintain Backside alignment and re-establish inside-knee advantage.

## Common Mistakes
- Following the roll but failing to settle, allowing defender to re-pummel into standard 50/50 or escape knee line.
- Over-focusing on hands/grips while losing body alignment and wedges.
- Treating Backside as “automatic finish” and rushing breaking mechanics before structure is stable.
- Ignoring the possibility of sweep/top outcomes and tunnelling on submissions when defender is structurally safe.

## Personal Notes
- My highest-percentage entry into Backside 50/50 is:  
- My best stabilisation cue (what I feel in hips/knees):  
- My preferred outcome hierarchy (finish vs Far-Hip vs sweep):  
- My most common loss condition (where it breaks down):
