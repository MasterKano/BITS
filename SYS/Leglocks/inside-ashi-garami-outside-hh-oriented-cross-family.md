# System: Inside Ashi Garami (Cross-Family Variant, Outside Heel Hook Orientation)

## Purpose
- Provide a Cross-Ashi-adjacent control hub that preserves asymmetry while orienting finishing and control toward **outside heel hook** lines.
- Serve as a reliable transition destination when the defender “corrects” hip alignment during Cross-Ashi defence, allowing the attacker to **follow the turn** without losing knee line.
- Maintain leg safety and back-safety while continuing to build **heel exposure**, **dilemma threats**, and structured exits into higher-offence hubs (e.g., Backside 50/50, Far-Hip Ashi).

## Key Positions
- **Inside Ashi baseline**
  - Structural cousin of Cross Ashi; leg configuration reoriented so the attacker’s primary finishing line is outside-heel-hook aligned.
- **Cross → Inside transition frame**
  - The moment defender rotates/turns to “correct” hips; attacker rethreads/reorients to keep wedges and heel access.
- **Inside Ashi + secondary leg awareness**
  - May be single-leg dominant at first; opportunities to convert into two-leg control (partial double trouble, lace-style control) depending on defender posture.
- **Inside Ashi → Backside 50/50 pathway**
  - Roll-following transition when defender inverts/rolls; used to upgrade to stronger breaking alignment.
- **Inside Ashi → Far-Hip Ashi safety shell**
  - Used when exchange begins to drift toward symmetry or when attacker’s own foot exposure increases.

## Key Cues
- **Arrive because they turned**
  - When the defender rotates to escape Cross, treat that rotation as the trigger to re-orient into Inside Ashi rather than fighting to “hold Cross” at all costs.
- **Preserve knee line first, then expose heel**
  - Inside Ashi still obeys the knee-line gate; if the knee is slipping, re-wedge/re-thread before hunting heel.
- **Outside-heel-hook alignment**
  - Ensure your rotational line matches outside HH mechanics (deny defender’s ability to freely turn their knee/hip to unwind).
- **Back-safety via chest-to-hip orientation**
  - Keep chest and hips aimed toward defender’s hip line; if you feel them “behind” you, re-centre or transition.
- **Use dilemmas to force predictable rotation**
  - Toe-hold and Achilles threats can create the rotation you need to expose the heel and lock the outside HH.

## Drills & Games
- **Cross → Inside on the turn (reaction drill)**
  - Start in Cross Ashi; defender’s job is to turn to “correct” alignment; attacker must transition to Inside Ashi immediately without losing knee line.
- **Inside Ashi heel-exposure reps**
  - Controlled rounds focused only on heel visibility and re-wedging; no finish allowed until heel exposure is stable for a set count (e.g., 3 seconds).
- **Inside Ashi roll-following to Backside**
  - Defender performs 1–2 controlled rolls; attacker follows and lands in Backside 50/50 or returns to Inside with improved control.
- **Inside Ashi safety-shell exits**
  - From Inside Ashi, attacker practices exiting to Far-Hip Ashi or another asymmetrical hub when own foot becomes exposed or symmetry emerges.

## Common Mistakes
- Staying in Cross Ashi too long while defender turns, causing loss of wedges and back exposure instead of transitioning cleanly.
- Chasing heel without knee-line stability, leading to “almost heel exposure” that collapses under rotation.
- Letting exchange degrade into 50/50/mutual without an explicit plan (failure to choose a landing hub).
- Over-rotating torso away from hips to maintain grip, inviting back takes.

## Personal Notes
- My best trigger cue for Cross → Inside:  
- My preferred outside-HH setup sequence from Inside:  
- My common failure point (knee-line slip vs back-safety):  
- My go-to “upgrade” when defender rolls (Backside vs Far-Hip):
