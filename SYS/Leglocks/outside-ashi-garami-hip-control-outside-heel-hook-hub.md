# System: Outside Ashi Garami (Hip Control + Heel Exposure Hub)

## Purpose
- Establish a **stable asymmetrical entanglement** that prioritises **hip control, back-exposure denial, and methodical heel exposure**.
- Serve as a primary finishing platform for **outside heel hooks** while maintaining a strong **Achilles–heel hook dilemma** layer.
- Provide reliable transition pathways into **Cross/Inside Ashi**, **Backside 50/50**, and **Far-Hip Ashi** as the defender high-legs, turns, kneels, or rolls.

## Key Positions
- **Outside Ashi baseline (supine)**
  - Leg scissoring + knee pinch controlling the trapped leg while keeping attacker oriented to the defender’s hips.
- **Cross-shin control variant**
  - Shin frame across waist/hip line to reinforce hip pinning, deny high-leg attempts, and stabilise heel exposure.
- **Belly-down exposure outcomes**
  - Follow-the-roll landings that convert rotational escapes into stronger breaking alignment.
- **Kneeling-opponent Outside Ashi**
  - Defender drops to knees to turn out; attacker maintains hip pin + heel exposure without allowing back exposure.
- **Post-Ashi / Post-feet exposure patterns**
  - Use defender posts as anchors to trap hips and improve heel angle control.
- **Transitions**
  - Outside → Cross/Inside Ashi when defender turns/high-legs.
  - Outside → Backside 50/50 / Far-Hip as defender rolls or symmetry emerges.

## Key Cues
- **Hip control is the engine**
  - If hips rotate freely, heel exposure will fail; clamp hips first, then hunt heel.
- **Back-exposure denial is non-negotiable**
  - Stay oriented to their hips; leg scissoring + cross-shin prevent them from getting behind you.
- **Knee line before grip**
  - If the knee is escaping past your hip line, stop “finishing” and re-wedge / re-angle / transition.
- **High-leg response**
  - When they raise the leg to free the knee: re-capture with scissor + cross-shin; do not let them step over into safety.
- **Follow the roll, don’t chase the foot**
  - Stay glued through rotation and land in a planned hub (belly-down, Cross/Inside, Backside) rather than losing structure mid-roll.
- **Dilemma framing**
  - Use **Achilles as tether/control**; when they react to relieve pressure or hide heel, convert to heel exposure and finish/transition.

## Drills & Games
- **Outside-Ashi stress-test circuit**
  - Defender cycles: back-out (knee-line escape), forward pressure, high-leg, controlled roll; attacker focuses on hip pin + knee line retention.
- **High-leg capture reps**
  - Defender repeatedly high-legs; attacker’s only goal: re-trap knee line with scissor/cross-shin and re-expose heel.
- **Belly-up ↔ belly-down conversion reps**
  - From heel exposure, defender initiates a roll; attacker follows and must land belly-down with intact knee line and heel control.
- **Kneeling opponent scenario rounds**
  - Start with defender on knees in Outside Ashi; attacker chooses: heel exposure finish OR sweep/transition without losing hip pin.
- **Achilles-to-heel dilemma drill**
  - Start with Achilles control; defender gives one scripted reaction (turn/roll/pull knee); attacker responds with a pre-defined heel exposure or transition.

## Common Mistakes
- Allowing hips to rotate (weak scissor/cross-shin), creating back exposure or losing heel line.
- Over-focusing on the heel while the knee line is sliding out.
- Letting the defender’s high-leg turn into a step-over escape because the cross-shin/scissor wasn’t rebuilt.
- Following rolls with arm strength instead of moving hips/torso with the defender’s rotation.
- Staying in a deteriorated Outside Ashi instead of transitioning to Cross/Inside or Backside/Far-Hip when the defender’s reactions demand it.

## Personal Notes
- My best Outside-Ashi entry (from Irimi / scrambles / top):  
- My default high-leg answer (scissor/cross-shin detail that works for me):  
- My highest-percentage finish from Outside (Achilles vs outside HH):  
- My best follow-the-roll landing hub (belly-down vs Backside vs Cross/Inside):  
- My most common failure (what causes it):
