# System: Post Ashi (Standing/Posting Reaction Hub)

## 1. Purpose
Post Ashi is a **reaction hub** used when the defender posts hands/feet, stands, or drives forward in ways that would otherwise:
- strip your knee-line control,
- collapse your structure into a stack/pass,
- or force you into frantic “foot chasing.”

In this instructional context, Post Ashi exists to:
- convert **posting/standing** into a **wedge** you can stabilise against,
- preserve **knee-line ownership** while the defender changes posture/height,
- keep you connected long enough to either **finish (Achilles/HH/Toe)** or upgrade into higher-offence hubs (Outside/Cross/Backside/Far-Hip).

## 2. When to Use It
Use Post Ashi when:
- the defender posts and begins to stand to clear the knee line,
- the defender tries to “come up” to crush you (forward pressure),
- the defender’s posture changes make classic Irimi feel unstable or hand-dependent,
- you need a reliable structure that keeps you attached while you re-angle.

Avoid staying in Post Ashi if:
- your hips drift away and the defender can fully posture + step out,
- your own feet become exposed in a symmetric battle without heel safety.

## 3. Structural Definition
Post Ashi is defined by:
- maintaining your core entanglement (you still own the trapped leg’s knee line),
- using the defender’s **post** (hand/foot on mat, or standing leg position) as an **anchor** to stop disengagement,
- re-angling your hips so the defender’s attempts to posture **reinforce** your wedges rather than break them.

Key structural idea:
- The defender’s post is not “freedom”; it is a *fixed point* you can wedge against.

## 4. Core Priorities (Non-Negotiables)
1) **Knee line first**
   - If the knee starts to clear, Post Ashi becomes a retention/recapture problem, not a finishing moment.
2) **Hip-to-hip distance**
   - Post Ashi fails when you allow long distance and try to hold with hands.
3) **Post becomes a wedge**
   - Your angle should make their post feel “stuck” and load-bearing.
4) **Far leg awareness**
   - If the far leg is free to step over, pummel, or kick your grips, you must address it immediately.

## 5. Entry Triggers and Common Entries
### 5.1 Irimi → Post Ashi (defender posts to stand)
Trigger: defender posts foot and begins to stand, or hip-heists away.
- Your job is to keep the entanglement attached as their level changes, not to rush a finish.

### 5.2 Irimi → Post Ashi (forward pressure “crush” attempt)
Trigger: defender drives forward, trying to smash head/shoulders and free the leg.
- Post Ashi helps you re-angle so their forward drive doesn’t collapse your spine and wedges.

### 5.3 Outside/Cross → Post Ashi (when posture breaks your alignment)
Trigger: you have the leg but their post/stance makes your current hip line weak.
- Post Ashi is the “stabilise while they change height” connector.

## 6. Control Checklist (Quick Audit)
Before attacking:
- Can the defender **slide the knee out** in one smooth step back?
- Can the defender **step over** or square up to initiate a pass?
- Can you pause (1–2 seconds) without your structure collapsing?
- Is your position driven by **leg wedges** rather than arm pulling?

If any answer is “yes,” fix structure or transition—do not escalate.

## 7. Primary Offensive Functions
Post Ashi is usually “threat to stabilise → upgrade → finish.”
The common offensive pattern is:
1) stabilise against the post,
2) create a tether (often Achilles),
3) force a predictable reaction (turn/roll/back-out),
4) land in a higher-percentage hub.

### 7.1 Achilles as tether (high-percentage from Post Ashi)
- Achilles becomes a control handle: it prevents clean disengagement and forces the defender to react.
- Use the tether to buy time to re-angle or transition.

### 7.2 Heel exposure opportunities
- As defender adjusts their stance/posture to relieve Achilles pressure, heel lines often appear briefly.
- Your priority is to expose heel **without losing knee line**.

### 7.3 Toe hold as “fast-onset” reaction tool (situational)
- If the defender’s posture and foot angle present a clean toe-hold, it is often used to force an immediate change (unlocking, turning, or stepping in a way that gives you better hubs).

## 8. Defensive Responsibilities (What You Must Prevent)
The defender’s main counter-goals:
- fully posture and back out (knee line clearance),
- step over/around your legs and pass,
- turn the exchange into 50/50/mutual while your heel is unsafe.

Your defence-first tasks:
- keep hips close,
- deny step-over lanes (angle + wedges),
- avoid symmetric entanglement unless your heel is protected.

## 9. Transition Map (Defaults)
### 9.1 Post Ashi → Outside Ashi (default upgrade)
Use when you stabilise the post and can rotate into Outside for stronger hip control and back-safety.

### 9.2 Post Ashi → Cross/Inside Ashi (if defender turns)
If the defender rotates/turns to free the leg, use that rotation to enter cross-family wedges.

### 9.3 Post Ashi → Backside 50/50 (roll-follow landing)
If your attachment carries you behind their knee line during a roll, stabilise backside and avoid drifting into symmetry.

### 9.4 Post Ashi → Far-Hip Ashi (safety resolution)
If exchange becomes risky or symmetric, Far-Hip is the common safety shell to hide your own feet and re-establish asymmetry.

### 9.5 Post Ashi → Exit (guard/stand)
If:
- knee line is clearly lost, or
- you are being squared/passed, or
- your heel is threatened,
then exit and re-enter on your terms.

## 10. Drilling Progressions
### 10.1 Technical reps (0–20%)
- Start in Irimi; defender posts to stand; attacker switches to Post Ashi and freezes.
- Add Achilles tether lightly; defender changes posture; attacker maintains structure.

### 10.2 Scripted resistance (20–60%)
Defender cycles:
1) stand + back-out,
2) forward pressure,
3) step-over attempt,
4) turn/roll.
Attacker:
- must keep knee line and reach an intended hub (Outside/Cross/Backside/Far-Hip).

### 10.3 Positional rounds (60–90%)
- Start in Post Ashi with knee line captured.
- Attacker wins by: upgrade + finish, or clean exit to top/guard.
- Defender wins by: knee line escape or pass.

## 11. Common Failure Patterns and Fixes
### 11.1 “Holding with hands”
Fix: rebuild wedges, close hip distance, use legs to pin—hands are direction tools.

### 11.2 “Letting them step over”
Fix: change hip angle earlier; treat step-over attempt as a transition trigger (Outside/Cross) not a panic moment.

### 11.3 “Finishing while knee line is gone”
Fix: hard rule—if knee line slips, stop attacking and recapture or exit.
