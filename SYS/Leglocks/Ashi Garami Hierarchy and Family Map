# System: Ashi Garami Hierarchy and Family Map

## Purpose
- Provide the **positional taxonomy** for the leg-lock game: where you are, what it’s for, and where you should go next.
- Establish a **default hierarchy**: entry hubs → consolidation hubs → high-offence endpoints, with symmetric “danger zones” solved by conversion to asymmetry.
- Create a common language for transitions (pummels, rolls, switches) so decision-making stays consistent under resistance.

## Key Positions
- **Entry / Acquisition hubs**
  - **Irimi Ashi**
    - Default initial entanglement; easiest to acquire from many phases; stabilises knee line and sets early threats.
  - **Other entry entanglements (situational)**
    - Direct drops into Outside/Cross/50/50 can happen in scrambles, but Irimi is the canonical structured entry when available.

- **Asymmetrical consolidation hubs**
  - **Outside Ashi**
    - Primary asymmetrical outside-heel/heel-exposure platform; strong hip control and back-safety when scissoring/cross-shin are correct.
  - **Cross Ashi**
    - High-power inverted heel platform and frequent gateway to two-leg control.
  - **Inside Ashi**
    - Cross-like structure oriented toward outside heel finishes; common transition when defender “corrects” hip or turns.

- **High-offence asymmetrical endpoints**
  - **Backside 50/50**
    - Upgraded finishing orientation; strong heel exposure with reduced defensive rotation options.
  - **Far-Hip Ashi**
    - Safety-forward asymmetry; hides attacker’s feet while retaining offence and strong transition potential.
  - **Top Ushiro**
    - Top-control derivative that maintains leg control while gaining positional dominance and multiple finishing lines.

- **Symmetric “danger zones”**
  - **50/50**
    - Symmetric entanglement; initiative determined by inside-knee positioning, grip fighting, and separation mechanics; used as a battlefield or control zone, not a home.
  - **Mutual Ashi**
    - Symmetric outside-heel environment; both can attack; requires heel protection first and disciplined conversion to asymmetry.

## Key Cues
- **Asymmetry is the organising principle**
  - Preferred state: you can attack their leg(s) while your feet are comparatively insulated.
  - Symmetry is tolerated only with a clear conversion plan.

- **Hierarchy (default movement)**
  - **Entry** → **Consolidation** → **Endpoint**
    - Irimi → Outside / Cross / Inside → Backside 50/50 / Far-Hip / Ushiro
  - If you enter directly into symmetry (50/50 / Mutual), your first job is to **solve it** (inside knee, heel safety, separation) and exit.

- **Role clarity by family**
  - Irimi: acquire + stabilise + start dilemmas; upgrade.
  - Outside: hip control + back-safety + methodical heel exposure; transition when they high-leg/turn/roll.
  - Cross/Inside: power hubs; manage back exposure and inversion; use two-leg control when available.
  - Backside/Far-Hip/Ushiro: finish or convert to top control; safest high-value outcomes.

- **Conversion rules**
  - From **symmetry**:
    - 50/50: “attack until you’re defending” (be first to create separation/initiative).
    - Mutual: “go last” (hide your heel first, then threaten).
    - Primary goal in both: reach Backside 50/50 or Far-Hip, then rejoin the asymmetrical hub network.

- **Triggers to transition**
  - Opponent **back-outs**: chase hips, re-trap knee line, upgrade to stronger hip control.
  - Opponent **drives forward / comes up**: use frames + re-angle to Post/Butterfly connectors or upgrade to Outside/Far-Hip.
  - Opponent **high-legs / turns**: Outside → Cross/Inside, or re-capture with cross-shin and leg scissoring.
  - Opponent **rolls / spins**: follow the leg; aim to land in Backside 50/50, Far-Hip, or a clean Outside/Cross.
  - Opponent **re-pummels**: win inside position; if you lose, expect 50/50/Mutual and shift immediately to symmetry rules.

## Drills & Games
- **Family recognition rounds**
  - Coach calls a family name mid-round; attacker must transition into that family cleanly within 5–10 seconds (no finishing).
- **Hub-to-endpoint flow**
  - Script: Irimi → Outside → Cross/Inside → Backside or Far-Hip → finish or sweep-to-top (light resistance).
- **Symmetry solver rounds**
  - Start in 50/50 or Mutual; score only for:
    - safe heel protection,
    - separation / inside-knee win,
    - clean exit to Backside or Far-Hip.
- **Decision-trigger drill**
  - Defender cycles: back-out → forward pressure → roll; attacker must choose the correct “next family” each time.

## Common Mistakes
- Treating families as isolated “moves” rather than a network with hubs and exits.
- Staying voluntarily in 50/50 or Mutual without a clear initiative/conversion plan.
- Forcing finishes from consolidation hubs when the correct play is upgrading to an endpoint.
- Transitioning without identifying the trigger (moving “randomly” vs moving because of a specific defender reaction).
- Confusing Cross vs Inside orientation and losing back-safety during hip corrections.

## Personal Notes
- My highest-percentage hub (where I feel most control):  
- My most common involuntary entry into symmetry (what error causes it):  
- My best conversion route out of 50/50:  
- My best conversion route out of Mutual:  
- My default endpoint target under pressure (Backside vs Far-Hip vs Ushiro):
