# System: Knee Line and Wedge Control

## Purpose
- Define the universal control requirements that make leg entanglements functional: **own the knee line, control the hips, deny rotation/escape routes**.
- Provide a consistent checklist for when to **attack**, **transition**, or **reset/exit**.
- Reduce “grip-first” behaviour by prioritising **structural wedges** over hand strength.

## Key Positions
- **Knee line (conceptual reference)**
  - Defender’s knee relative to attacker’s hip line is the main indicator of whether breaks are real or imaginary.
- **Primary wedge families (common across Ashi variations)**
  - **Thigh clamp / knee pinch** around defender’s upper leg (prevents sliding escape).
  - **Leg scissor / clamp** controlling defender’s thigh/hip rotation (denies turning and back exposure).
  - **Cross-shin / hip frame** across waist/hip line (prevents high-leg + controls pelvic rotation).
  - **Far-hip control / hook** (stabilises rotation + protects attacker’s feet).
  - **Two-leg control (double trouble / leg lace)** when available (limits defender’s base, heist, and spin).
- **Hand/upper-body components (secondary to wedges)**
  - Heel exposure management and finishing connection once wedges are stable.
  - Hand fighting to protect your own heel in symmetric positions.

## Key Cues
- **Non-negotiables (in order)**
  - **Knee line first:** if the knee is escaping, solve that before “finishing harder”.
  - **Hips close:** close the distance; extended hips = weak control + easy spins.
  - **Know your wedge:** you should be able to name the exact wedge preventing each escape direction.
- **Directional control model (defender’s four exits)**
  - **Back out / retreat** (knee slides away)
    - Cue: chase hips; tighten knee pinch; re-angle to keep knee trapped deep.
  - **Forward pressure** (crush and come up)
    - Cue: frames + leg structure that denies chest-to-head collapse; prioritise hip control over grip changes.
  - **Rotate / roll / spin** (turns to unwind torque)
    - Cue: stay glued to leg; rotate with them; land in a known hub rather than fighting the roll with arms.
  - **Re-pummel** (re-thread legs to enter their own entanglement)
    - Cue: win inside position with your legs; control the far leg; avoid leaving a “free” lane for their pummel.
- **Stress-test logic (before committing to high-risk finishes)**
  - Briefly reduce hand dependence and confirm wedges hold under:
    - controlled back-out attempt,
    - controlled forward pressure,
    - controlled rotation/roll,
    - controlled re-pummel attempt.
- **When to switch legs**
  - If primary heel exposure is repeatedly defended but structure is stable, switch targets while opponent is mid-reaction; leg switch should create immediate new dilemma.
- **When to reset / exit**
  - If you cannot clearly maintain:
    - knee line ownership,
    - hip control/back-safety,
    - and far-leg awareness,
    - then reset to a simpler hub or exit (guard/stand) rather than forcing low-percentage pressure.

## Drills & Games
- **Knee-line retention drill (scripted)**
  - Start in a stable entanglement; defender’s only goal is to back-out; attacker’s only goal is hip chase + knee re-trap (no submissions).
- **Four-direction stress-test rounds**
  - Defender cycles each direction for 20–30 seconds; attacker must maintain wedges or transition to a stronger hub.
- **No-hands wedge check (light)**
  - Attacker builds entanglement, briefly reduces hand reliance, and must keep defender controlled using legs/hips only; reintroduce hands after control is validated.
- **Far-leg awareness game**
  - Defender’s goal is to stand/heist using the far leg; attacker scores only if they block the far leg before attacking.
- **Follow-the-roll drill**
  - Defender performs 1–3 controlled rolls; attacker must maintain knee line and land in a predetermined hub (Outside/Cross/Backside/Far-Hip).
- **Reset competency drill**
  - Start in “messy entanglement”; attacker must choose: rebuild to clean hub, exit to guard, or exit to stand—graded on correct decision and safety.

## Common Mistakes
- **Grip-first finishing** while the knee line is already escaping.
- **Hips drifting away** (extended posture) while trying to “hold” the foot.
- **Ignoring the far leg**, allowing stands, posts, and re-pummels that strip control.
- **Fighting the roll with arms** instead of rotating the hips and following the leg.
- **Unclear wedge logic** (cannot identify what prevents each escape direction).
- **Failure to reset** when structure becomes ambiguous, leading to counters and mutual shootouts.

## Personal Notes
- My most common knee-line failure moment (what triggers it):  
- Best wedge that fixes it (what I should default to):  
- My best “structure check” cue mid-roll:  
- My default reset (simplest hub) when lost:
