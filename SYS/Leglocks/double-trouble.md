# System: Double Trouble (Two-Leg Control Hub)

## 1. Purpose
Double Trouble is a **two-leg immobilisation hub** that removes the defender’s key escape tools:
- standing,
- spinning,
- pummelling a free leg to clear the knee line,
- and creating counter-leg attacks.

In this instructional context, Double Trouble is used to:
- convert stubborn defensive structures (crossed legs, figure-4s, locked ankles) into controllable positions,
- create clean dilemmas: **Toe Hold ↔ Knee Bar** and **Toe Hold ↔ Heel Hook** (ruleset dependent),
- dramatically increase finishing reliability by preventing the defender from rotating freely.

## 2. When to Use It
Use Double Trouble when:
- the defender crosses/locks legs to hide a heel or prevent separation,
- your single-leg control is strong but they keep escaping by standing/spinning,
- you are in Top Ushiro or Cross-family positions where trapping the second leg is available,
- you want to force predictable reactions before committing to rotational breaks.

## 3. Structural Definition
Double Trouble is defined by:
- both of the defender’s legs being trapped/controlled by your legs and/or body positioning,
- your structure preventing them from freely rotating hips and freeing the knee line,
- an orientation that gives you safe access to a foot/ankle while their second leg cannot assist.

Key idea:
- two-leg control converts many “shootouts” into one-way traffic.

## 4. Core Control Priorities
1) **Immobilise hips through legs**
   - Your legs should be doing the pinning; hands finish.
2) **Prevent “secondary leg rescue”**
   - The free leg is the defender’s best tool—remove it.
3) **Maintain knee line before torque**
   - Torque without knee-line ownership is unreliable and unsafe in training.
4) **Do not rush**
   - Double Trouble is meant to be stable; stability is the advantage.

## 5. Entry Triggers and Common Entries
### 5.1 From Top Ushiro when legs are crossed/locked
Trigger: they lock legs to hide heel lines or to prevent you separating the feet.
- Enter Double Trouble to trap both legs and force an unlock reaction.

### 5.2 From Cross Ashi / leg entanglements when second leg becomes accessible
Trigger: you have primary leg entangled and can scoop/trap the second leg during their defensive pummel.

### 5.3 From “locked legs” defence in general
Trigger: any time their defensive lock is what is preventing your progression.
- Double Trouble is the system answer: trap the lock, remove mobility, then attack.

## 6. Offensive System (Primary Dilemmas)
### 6.1 Toe Hold ↔ Unlock Dilemma
- If they keep the lock: toe hold threatens fast damage.
- If they unlock: you gain separation and can transition to:
  - knee bar,
  - heel exposure,
  - or a better Ashi hub.

### 6.2 Toe Hold ↔ Knee Bar Dilemma
- Toe hold forces extension/rotation reactions.
- Those reactions frequently expose straight-line knee attacks when their leg extends.

### 6.3 Heel Hook integration (ruleset dependent)
- When heel hooks are legal, Double Trouble often creates safer heel exposure because the defender cannot spin and pummel freely.

## 7. Defensive Responsibilities (What You Must Prevent)
- letting the defender free one leg to stand and strip the position,
- losing base and getting rolled during transitions,
- exposing your own heels during the exchange (especially if it drifts into symmetry).

## 8. Transition Map
### 8.1 Double Trouble → Finish (Toe/Knee/HH)
Choose based on:
- ruleset,
- foot exposure,
- defender reaction.

### 8.2 Double Trouble → Backside/Far-Hip
If the exchange becomes rotational and you need a safer asymmetry resolution.

### 8.3 Double Trouble → Top dominance (pass/back)
If they defend leg breaks by turning aggressively, convert to positional dominance.

## 9. Drilling Progressions
### 9.1 Technical
- Start with defender legs crossed; attacker builds Double Trouble and freezes.
- Add toe hold threat slowly; defender chooses unlock vs endure; attacker responds with scripted branch.

### 9.2 Progressive resistance
Defender attempts:
1) unlock and pummel,
2) roll,
3) stand up,
4) turn hard.
Attacker:
- must maintain two-leg control and reach a stable outcome (finish or transition).

### 9.3 Positional rounds
Start in Double Trouble.
Attacker scores:
- controlled finish, or
- stable conversion to pass/back.
Defender scores:
- clean escape to standing/guard without giving up dominant position.

## 10. Common Failure Patterns
- “Two-leg control isn’t real” (one leg is loosely trapped)
  - Fix: re-pin both legs before attacking.
- “Rushing torque”
  - Fix: stabilise first; knee line + hip pin then torque.
- “Losing base on top”
  - Fix: widen base, pin hips; do not lean past control.
