# System: Butterfly Ashi (Connector Hub)

## 1. Purpose
Butterfly Ashi is a **connector configuration** that prioritises mobility, hip-following, and rapid re-orientation over being a final “home base.” In this instructional context, it primarily exists to:
- Preserve **knee-line control** during forward pressure, standing/posting reactions, and early roll attempts.
- Improve **angle creation** for heel exposure when base Irimi alignment becomes stagnant or compromised.
- Create reliable transitions back into higher-control hubs (especially **Outside Ashi**) or into other families (Cross/Inside, Backside 50/50, Far-Hip) depending on defender reactions.

## 2. When to Use It
Use Butterfly Ashi when:
- You have Irimi control but the defender’s posture and forward pressure are making your **upper-body frames and leg wedges** harder to maintain.
- The defender starts to **post** and “build base” (hands/feet) and you need a more mobile hook to follow hips.
- The defender’s knee line is still capturable, but the angle for heel exposure is poor (you feel “stuck”).
- You anticipate or feel the onset of **rotational escape** and want a configuration that makes “follow the leg” easier.

Avoid treating Butterfly Ashi as a prolonged finishing platform if:
- Your wedges are loose and the position becomes hand-dependent.
- Your hips drift away and the defender can clear the knee line by backing out.

## 3. Structural Definition
Butterfly Ashi is characterised by:
- **Primary leg entanglement preserved** (you still own the knee line).
- A **butterfly-style hook/instep engagement** that adds mobility and hip-following leverage.
- A structure that supports quick changes between:
  - re-centering to Irimi,
  - upgrading to Outside Ashi,
  - rotating into Cross/Inside families when the defender turns.

## 4. Entry Triggers and Typical Entries
### 4.1 From Irimi under forward pressure
Trigger: defender drives in (trying to crush head/chest) or “comes up” aggressively.
- Re-orient from static Irimi control to a more mobile hook so you can:
  - keep the knee line trapped,
  - angle off their pressure line,
  - prevent them from stacking you into a pass.

### 4.2 From Irimi when heel exposure stalls
Trigger: you cannot reliably expose heel without losing far-leg awareness or posture.
- Butterfly hook helps you shift angles without “reaching” with arms.

### 4.3 From early roll attempts
Trigger: defender begins to rotate/roll and your current leg geometry feels like it will get peeled.
- Use Butterfly Ashi as a mid-roll connector to stay glued and land in a better hub.

## 5. Control Checklist (Non-Negotiables)
Use this quick checklist before escalating to submissions or transitions:
1) **Knee line is still owned**
   - If the knee is sliding out, this is not a finishing moment—this is a retention moment.
2) **Hips are close to their hips**
   - If your pelvis is drifting away, you are turning it into a foot chase.
3) **Your hook is doing work**
   - The “butterfly” element should meaningfully control/track their hip line, not just exist.
4) **You can pause without collapsing**
   - Briefly relax aggressive gripping (without fully letting go) and confirm the position doesn’t immediately unravel.
5) **Far leg awareness is active**
   - If the far leg is free to post/pummel/stand, your next action must address it (hook, clamp, angle, or transition).

## 6. Primary Roles in the System
### 6.1 Mobility and hip-following
Butterfly Ashi is your “suspension” for when the defender is trying to change level, posture, or direction.

### 6.2 Pressure relief and re-angling
It helps you stop treating forward pressure as a problem you solve with arms and instead solve it with **angle + wedges**.

### 6.3 Transition acceleration
It is often the cleanest pathway into:
- **Outside Ashi** (upgrade to a more stable finishing hub),
- **Post Ashi** (if posting/standing becomes the primary battle),
- **Cross/Inside Ashi** (if they rotate/turn and give you a better wedge line),
- **Backside 50/50** (if roll-follow carries you behind their knee line),
- **Far-Hip Ashi** (if you need to hide your own feet and stabilise).

## 7. Offense: What You Typically Threaten From Here
Butterfly Ashi is usually not “finish-first.” The offensive priority is:
- **Stabilise → re-angle → threaten a tether** (often Achilles control) → upgrade to a higher-control hub → finish.

Common offensive actions:
- **Achilles as tether**
  - Use it to stop disengagement and to force predictable reactions (turn/roll/back-out).
- **Heel exposure attempt**
  - When the defender reacts to the tether or shifts posture, heel lines often appear briefly.
- **Transition-based finishing**
  - “Threaten here, finish there” is the normal pattern: Butterfly Ashi creates the conditions to finish in Outside/Cross/Backside.

## 8. Defensive Responsibilities (What You Must Prevent)
The defender’s main goals against Butterfly Ashi:
- Clear the **knee line** by backing out.
- Collapse you with forward pressure into a pass.
- Use the **far leg** to stand, push, or pummel into a counter-entanglement.

Your defensive priorities:
- Maintain hip proximity (no long-chain positions).
- Prevent clean stand-ups by controlling or blocking far leg access.
- Be willing to **reset** to Irimi/Outside if structure degrades.

## 9. Transition Map (Practical Defaults)
### 9.1 Butterfly Ashi → Outside Ashi (default upgrade)
Use when:
- you have stable knee line and want a better long-term hub for hip control and back-safety.
Objective:
- keep knee line intact during rotation; do not “trade control for angle.”

### 9.2 Butterfly Ashi → Post Ashi (when posting/standing is the battle)
Use when:
- defender posts hard or begins standing sequences.
Objective:
- treat the post as a wedge and stabilise the entanglement against posture changes.

### 9.3 Butterfly Ashi → Cross/Inside Ashi (when defender turns/rotates)
Use when:
- defender rotates hips in a way that creates a cross-family wedge line.
Objective:
- convert their defensive rotation into your improved breaking alignment.

### 9.4 Butterfly Ashi → Backside 50/50 (roll-follow landing)
Use when:
- the defender roll carries you behind the knee/hip line.
Objective:
- stabilise backside, avoid drifting back into symmetry.

### 9.5 Butterfly Ashi → Exit (guard/stand) when structure is gone
Use when:
- knee line is clearly lost or your feet are becoming exposed.
Objective:
- exit safely and re-enter rather than forcing a low-control attack.

## 10. Drilling Progressions
### 10.1 Technical reps (low resistance)
- Irimi → Butterfly Ashi: enter and freeze; partner checks knee line + hip closeness.
- Butterfly Ashi → Outside Ashi: timed reps, smooth rotation, no submission attempt.
- Butterfly Ashi → Post Ashi: partner posts/stands lightly; you follow and stabilise.

### 10.2 Progressive resistance (scripted)
Defender cycles:
1) back-out (knee extraction),
2) forward pressure,
3) turn/roll,
4) stand/post.
Attacker goal:
- stay connected and reach one of the “destination hubs” (Outside / Cross/Inside / Backside / Far-Hip) without losing knee line.

### 10.3 Positional rounds (live)
- Start in Butterfly Ashi with knee line already captured.
- Win conditions for attacker:
  - stabilise for 5–10 seconds,
  - upgrade to a higher-control hub,
  - or achieve a controlled submission finish (only if structure remains intact).
- Win conditions for defender:
  - clear knee line,
  - force pass/top pressure,
  - create counter-entanglement.

## 11. Common Failure Patterns and Fixes
### 11.1 “Chasing the foot”
Symptom: you pull with arms as hips drift away.
Fix:
- re-close hip distance first; re-assert wedges; then re-attack.

### 11.2 “Hook not doing real work”
Symptom: butterfly element feels cosmetic; defender walks/postures freely.
Fix:
- adjust angle so hook meaningfully tracks hip line; if you cannot, upgrade to Outside or reset.

### 11.3 “Ignoring the far leg”
Symptom: defender posts/stands repeatedly and strips the position.
Fix:
- treat far leg as a first-order control problem: block, clamp, hook, or transition.

### 11.4 “Staying too long”
Symptom: prolonged connector position with no progress.
Fix:
- set a rule: if you cannot upgrade to Outside/Cross/Backside within a short window, reset to Irimi/Outside or exit and re-enter.

## 12. Integration Notes (How It Fits Your Repo)
- Butterfly Ashi belongs in your **SYS/leglocks/** library because it is a repeatable connector system, not a one-off technique.
- It cross-links naturally to:
  - `irimi-ashi-garami.md` (primary source entry)
  - `outside-ashi-garami.md` (default upgrade)
  - `post-ashi.md` (posting/standing reactions)
  - `cross-ashi-garami.md` and `inside-ashi-garami.md` (rotation solutions)
  - `backside-50-50.md` and `far-hip-ashi.md` (asymmetry resolutions)

## 13. Personal Notes
- My best trigger to switch Irimi → Butterfly:  
- My highest percentage destination from Butterfly: (Outside / Post / Cross / Backside / Far-Hip)  
- My most common breakdown (back-out, forward pressure, roll, far-leg post):
