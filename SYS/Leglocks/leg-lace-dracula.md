# System: Leg Lace / Dracula Controls (Two-Leg Immobilisation)

## 1. Purpose
Leg Lace / Dracula controls are **two-leg immobilisation structures** designed to:
- trap both legs in a configuration that prevents effective pummelling/standing,
- create controlled exposure to one or both heels,
- and force the defender into predictable reactions (unlock, turn, roll, extend).

In this instructional context, these controls support:
- transitions into Cross/Inside families and Backside 50/50,
- systematic heel exposure without chasing,
- and stable finishing environments (especially when the defender is skilled at stripping single-leg attacks).

## 2. When to Use It
Use Leg Lace / Dracula controls when:
- the defender’s second leg is repeatedly rescuing the primary leg,
- you can trap both ankles/legs during Cross-family entanglements,
- you want to slow the exchange, reduce scrambles, and create systematic exposure,
- you need reliable immobilisation before pursuing heel hooks or knee bars.

## 3. Structural Definition
### 3.1 Leg Lace (two-leg binding)
- A binding structure that ties the defender’s legs together so they cannot independently move the “free” leg to pummel, stand, or push.

### 3.2 Dracula controls (forearm-based trapping)
- “Dracula” refers to forearm/arm-wrapping control that secures legs/ankles so the defender cannot easily rotate or strip grips.
- Variants can include “half” and “double” style controls depending on how many legs are wrapped/isolated.

Core idea:
- You create **immobility first**, then choose the highest-percentage exposure.

## 4. Core Control Priorities
1) **Both legs must be meaningfully constrained**
2) **Hip line + knee line remain central**
3) **Hands do not replace structure**
   - Dracula/lace is not “grip strength”; it’s alignment + leverage.
4) **Prevent turn-out / stand-up cycles**
   - If they stand repeatedly, your two-leg control is not tight enough.

## 5. Entry Triggers and Common Entries
### 5.1 From Cross Ashi / Shoelace / Stretch variations
Trigger: you have cross-family control and the defender keeps using the free leg to clear knee line.
- Transition to leg lace to remove their free-leg agency.

### 5.2 During leg pummelling exchanges
Trigger: the defender pummels to create symmetry or to free the leg.
- Use the moment of leg overlap to bind and immobilise.

### 5.3 From top-oriented control
Trigger: you are coming up (Top Ushiro) and can capture both legs as they retract.

## 6. Offensive System (What It Enables)
### 6.1 Systematic heel exposure
- With both legs constrained, heel exposure becomes a *procedure*:
  - stabilise,
  - isolate the target foot,
  - turn the heel line into visibility,
  - finish or transition.

### 6.2 Two-heel access (situational)
- Some laces/controls allow access to either heel depending on reaction.
- This supports “switch legs” behaviour: if one heel is hidden, attack the other.

### 6.3 Integration with Double Trouble
- Leg lace/dracula often functions as a cousin structure to Double Trouble:
  - both aim to remove mobility and force predictable dilemmas.

## 7. Defensive Responsibilities (What You Must Prevent)
- allowing the defender to separate legs and reintroduce pummelling,
- letting the defender turn the corner and expose your back (especially from cross-family),
- losing the knee line while you are “busy” with controls.

## 8. Transition Map
- Lace/Dracula → Cross/Inside Ashi finishing angles
- Lace/Dracula → Backside 50/50 (when rotation carries you behind knee line)
- Lace/Dracula → Top Ushiro (if you come up)
- Lace/Dracula → Double Trouble (if legs lock/cross defensively)

## 9. Drilling Progressions
### 9.1 Technical
- Start with defender trying to pummel free leg; attacker captures lace and freezes.
- Add “heel exposure procedure” with minimal force.

### 9.2 Progressive resistance
Defender cycles:
1) pummel and separate legs,
2) stand attempts,
3) roll,
4) turn hard.
Attacker:
- must keep two-leg constraint and land in a stable hub or finish.

### 9.3 Positional rounds
Start in a lace/dracula structure.
Attacker wins by:
- controlled exposure → finish or dominant transition.
Defender wins by:
- separating legs and clearing knee line.

## 10. Common Failure Patterns
- “Lace exists but legs still move independently”
  - Fix: rebind, adjust angle, close distance.
- “Over-focusing on hands”
  - Fix: legs/hips pin first; hands refine exposure.
- “Back exposure during cross-family”
  - Fix: re-centre chest to beltline; transition to safer hub if needed.
