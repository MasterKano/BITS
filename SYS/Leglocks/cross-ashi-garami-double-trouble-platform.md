# System: Cross Ashi Garami (Inverted Heel Hook + Double Trouble Platform)

## Purpose
- Provide a **high-offence asymmetrical entanglement** optimized for **inside (inverted) heel hook mechanics** and strong secondary-leg control.
- Act as a reliable platform for **double trouble** (two-leg control), limiting the defender’s ability to stand, spin, or freely roll.
- Create structured pathways to higher-offence endpoints (Backside 50/50 / Far-Hip) when the defender attempts to turn, invert, or force double-rolling exchanges.

## Key Positions
- **Cross Ashi baseline**
  - Cross-body leg entanglement that orients the attacker for strong rotational breaking mechanics.
- **Shoelace Ashi / Stretch Ashi (Cross-Ashi family variants)**
  - Variations used to manage slippage, maintain knee-line capture, and respond to pummelling/rotation.
- **Figure-4 / Reverse Figure-4 Achilles configurations**
  - Control + threat layers used to tether the leg, manage back-safety, and force reactions that open heel exposure.
- **Double trouble / Two-leg control**
  - Secondary leg captured (lace / clamp / wedge) to constrain rotation and create stable finishing mechanics.
- **Backside 50/50 connection**
  - Common “landing zone” when following rolls/inversions out of Cross Ashi.
- **Inside Ashi transition**
  - When defender turns to “correct” hip alignment, re-orient into an inside-ashi variant while maintaining heel access.

## Key Cues
- **Knee-line dominance first**
  - If the defender’s knee starts to clear your hip line, you are no longer in a reliable finishing structure—re-wedge or transition.
- **Back-safety is the tax of Cross Ashi**
  - Cross Ashi is offensively loaded but punishes loose orientation; keep chest/hip alignment disciplined and do not over-rotate away from their hips.
- **Two-leg control changes the game**
  - Whenever feasible, secure the secondary leg—reduces defender’s standing/heisting and makes heel exposure/finish dramatically more reliable.
- **Achilles as stabiliser**
  - Use Achilles grips (including figure-4 variants) to tether and buy time to:
    - re-centre chest,
    - improve leg wedges,
    - complete the secondary-leg capture.
- **If forced into double inversion, don’t “fight the chaos”**
  - Stay connected to knee + heel, re-centre, and aim to land in a known hub (Backside 50/50 / Inside Ashi) rather than forcing a finish mid-scramble.
- **Reset rule (control degradation)**
  - If the entanglement becomes unclear: re-centre chest toward hips and rebuild a clean Cross-Ashi structure before attacking again.

## Drills & Games
- **Cross-Ashi pummelling ladder**
  - Cycle: Cross Ashi → Shoelace → Stretch → back to Cross; focus on maintaining knee line through each switch.
- **Secondary-leg capture reps (double trouble build)**
  - Start with primary leg trapped; goal is to “collect” the second leg before initiating any finishing sequence.
- **Back-safety constraint drill**
  - Defender’s only goal is to turn and threaten back exposure; attacker’s goal is to keep chest facing hips while maintaining knee line and heel access.
- **Force-the-roll to Backside**
  - Initiate controlled heel exposure; defender performs a scripted roll; attacker follows and must land in Backside 50/50 or a clean re-formed Cross-Ashi.
- **Achilles-to-heel transition drill**
  - Begin with figure-4/reverse figure-4 Achilles control; defender reacts (turn/roll/pummel); attacker converts to heel exposure without losing wedges.

## Common Mistakes
- Chasing heel exposure while allowing **back exposure** (turning away from their hips).
- Attacking with one-leg control when two-leg control is available, making spins/escapes easier.
- Letting the knee line drift during pummelling transitions (Cross ↔ Shoelace ↔ Stretch).
- Fighting double inversions with arm strength instead of staying connected and landing in a planned hub.
- Refusing to reset when structure is unclear, leading to counter-attacks or position loss.

## Personal Notes
- My best Cross-Ashi entry (from Outside / scrambles / 50/50):  
- My highest-percentage route to double trouble:  
- My most common back-exposure failure (what triggers it):  
- My default landing hub when they roll (Backside / Inside / re-Cross):  
- My “reset cue” (what I feel when structure is degrading):
