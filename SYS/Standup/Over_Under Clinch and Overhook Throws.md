# Over/Under Clinch & Overhook-Based Throws

## 1. Purpose
- Use over/under as a central offensive tie rather than a neutral resting position.
- Connect the over/under clinch to forward, backward, and lateral throws (including Uki Goshi, Tai Otoshi, Uchi Mata, trips, and Uki Waza).

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Over/under base
- One underhook (your arm inside, elbow tight, shoulder connected).
- One overhook (your arm over, elbow tight, shoulder heavy).
- Hips close enough that you can feel their hip bone, not arm’s length away.
- Head position:
  - Forehead or side of head on underhook side, not across their face.

### Control points
- Underhook side:
  - Lifting and rotating power.
- Overhook side:
  - Pulling and blocking power.

### Throw directions
- Forward into overhook side:
  - Uki Goshi, Tai Otoshi, Uchi Mata variants.
- Backwards or lateral:
  - Kosoto, Ouchi, lateral drops.
- Sacrifice:
  - Uki Waza from strong overhook and hip placement.

## 3. Key Cues
- “Underhook lifts, overhook steers.”
- “Close the hip gap; arm’s length is dead space.”
- “Head on underhook side for control and safety.”
- “Choose direction based on where they lean or push.”
- “From over/under, you should always be threatening a family of throws.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Over/under footwork patterns
- From static over/under:
  - Practise:
    - Small forward steps on overhook side.
    - Backward steps pulling them into you.
    - Angle steps to load hips for Uchi Mata/Tai Otoshi.
  - Focus on hips and feet, not arms.

### Directional reaction drill
- Partner in over/under:
  - Alternates between:
    - Leaning forward into you.
    - Driving hips into you with shoulders back.
- You call (out loud at first) and then enact:
  - Forward-direction throw family when they lean.
  - Backwards/lateral-direction family when they drive in.

### Over/under “throw entry only” rounds
- 60–90 second rounds.
- Both players:
  - Fight for quality over/under.
  - Aim to get to loaded throw entries (hips set, direction chosen).
- Throws are “pulled” at the last moment; focus is on entries, not impact.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Treating over/under as a static tie-up with no clear throwing plan.
- Standing too far away – hips never loaded, throws become all arms.
- Letting head drift across to the wrong side or hang low.
- Never switching direction when partner changes posture or pressure.
