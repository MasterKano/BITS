# Counter-Wrestling vs Shots

## 1. Purpose
- Turn shot defence into one of the main engines of your upper body takedown game.
- Build a consistent reaction tree from single, double, and high-crotch attacks into scoring throws and pins.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Single-leg defence
- Strong whizzer:
  - Arm over their shot-side arm, shoulder heavy on their shoulder.
- Secondary control:
  - Grip on their wrist/hand of the attacking arm.
- Leg position:
  - Your captured leg steps back and outward to clear the knee line.

### Double-leg defence
- Sprawl with hips into their shoulders.
- Turn towards their head.
- Underhook or chest-wrap as they rise.
- Finish standing with:
  - Front headlock.
  - Over/under.
  - Body lock.

### Shot-counter throwing hubs
- From whizzer/lat/wrist:
  - Sumi Gaeshi.
  - Ude Gaeshi.
- From chest-wrap + butterfly hook:
  - Sumi Gaeshi variants.
- From front headlock:
  - Cow catcher.
  - Yoko Sumi Gaeshi.
  - Ouchi reaps when leg is exposed.

## 3. Key Cues
- “Whizzer plus wrist; leg back, then climb up.”
- “Turn towards the head on doubles.”
- “Every deep leg attack triggers one of your counters – never just a sprawl.”
- “If they come up high on the leg, elevate and throw; don’t stay bent over.”
- “From front headlock: pin them, trip them, or sacrifice – but don’t freeze.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Static entry to counter
- Partner starts on:
  - Single leg: you establish whizzer + wrist, free the leg, and climb to over/under.
  - Double leg: you turn towards the head, underhook/chest-wrap, and climb to clinch.
- Once positioning is correct, add Sumi/Ude or cow catcher finishes.

### Flow drill – three outcomes from shots
- Partner shoots realistically:
  - You sprawl, establish control, and branch to:
    - Cow catcher.
    - Sumi/Ude Gaeshi.
    - Yoko Sumi / Ouchi from front headlock.
- Rotate through all options deliberately.

### Limited rules “wrestling”
- Attacker can only score via shot.
- Defender can only score via shot counter (cow catcher, Sumi/Ude, Yoko Sumi/Ouchi).
- Forces defender to treat every shot as a throwing opportunity.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Treating sprawls as end points instead of transitions.
- Keeping whizzer loose and high, allowing the attacker to chain to re-attacks.
- Backing away after leg defence instead of claiming upper body grips.
- Trying to counter-throw without first establishing strong head/shoulder/arm control.
