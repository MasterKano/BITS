## Key Positions / Structures
- Strong overhook/whizzer:
  - Your arm wrapping over their underhooking arm.
  - Shoulder heavy on top of their shoulder.
  - Elbow pointing down and tight, not flared and loose.
- Shot-defence overhook:
  - Overhook combined with wrist control on their attacking hand.
  - Your hip/leg stepped back so your knee is clear of their grip.

## Key Cues
- “Offer the underhook to earn the overhook.”
- “Clamp with shoulder and elbow, don’t hang with a loose overhook.”
- “Whizzer plus wrist: free the leg, then climb to upper-body ties.”

## Drills & Games
- Overhook bait and clamp:
  - You flare elbow to show space; partner takes underhook.
  - You immediately clamp into heavy overhook and stabilise posture for 2–3 seconds.
- Single-leg whizzer series:
  - Start with partner on a light single.
  - You establish whizzer + wrist, free leg, then climb into over-under or strong overhook tie.
  - Repeat both sides.

## Common Mistakes
- Treating overhook as a loose “hug” with no shoulder pressure.
- Leaving elbow flared so partner can rotate freely under and attack.
- Using whizzer only to pull away instead of connecting it to upper-body counter grips.
