# Pummelling

## Key Positions / Structures
- Base pummelling stance:
  - Hips back, shoulders forward, knees bent, weight on toes.
- Standard starting tie:
  - One underhook and one overhook each, heads close.
- Double underhooks:
  - Both of your arms inside, elbows closed against ribs, hands connecting or controlling at their hips/waist.

## Key Cues
- “Head moves first, arm follows.”
- “Elbows wide is easy; elbows tight is real.”
- “Close your elbow to steal the second underhook.”
- “Count double unders, front headlock, and clear off-balances as scores.”

# Pummelling

## 1. Purpose
- Build comfort and cardio in upper-body clinch.
- Learn to fight for underhooks and overhooks without losing stance or posture.
- Develop awareness of:
  - When opponent is tracking your back.
  - When they are stepping around to better throwing angles.
- Create a “lab” for testing head position, footwork, and grip changes with low impact.

## 2. Key Positions
### Start position
- Over–under tie:
  - You: one underhook side, one overhook side.
  - Partner: mirror configuration.
- Head-to-head contact (forehead or side of head).
- Both in staggered stance, hips under shoulders.

### Common transitions
- Double underhooks (you or partner).
- Double overhooks.
- Momentary chest-to-chest with no clear tie.
- Angled positions where one partner is more side-on (back-tracking danger).

## 3. Key Cues
- “Spine straight, bend in knees/hips, not at the waist.”
- “Head-to-head – no empty space between our heads in tight.”
- “Elbows close; swim inside with short, efficient arm paths.”
- “Feet always in stance – small steps, no crossing.”
- “If my back starts to turn away from him, I have a problem.”

### For Jerry
- Prioritise:
  - Spine integrity and relaxed shoulders.
  - Smaller, cleaner movements over volume or speed.

### For Sam
- Prioritise:
  - Using timing and position, not strength.
  - Giving realistic pressure without exploding through Jerry’s frames.

## 4. Drills & Games
### A. Basic Continuous Pummelling
- Start in over–under.
- Both players:
  - Swim inside with one arm to obtain underhook.
  - Partner responds with overhook/whizzer.
  - Keep cycling, switching sides.
- Focus:
  - Never lose stance.
  - Keep head position stable.
  - Keep hips under you.

### B. Directional Pummelling
- Same as above, but:
  - “Leader” steers movement (forward, back, circling).
  - “Follower” maintains stance, does not let feet cross.
- Switch leader/follower roles every 30–60 seconds.

### C. Scoring Pummelling
- Rules:
  - 1 point if you:
    - Achieve clean double underhooks.
    - Force partner to post a hand on the mat (off-balance).
  - Reset after a score.
- Rounds:
  - 30–60 seconds each.
- Emphasis:
  - Use hips and steps, not just arm yanking.

### D. Positional Pummelling
- Start one person with an advantage:
  - E.g., one clean underhook.
- Bottom player’s goal:
  - Recover to neutral or better.
- Top player’s goal:
  - Progress to double underhooks, strong angles, or head-dominant positions.

### E. Progressive pummelling layers
- Head-only drill: move head shoulder-to-shoulder while maintaining stance.
- Easy pummelling: wide elbows, light threading, focus on rhythm.
- Tight pummelling: closed elbows, both fighting to gain double underhooks and deny inside space.

### Head-control integration
- Rule: each time partner’s head drops below your shoulder line, snap or briefly control the head, then return to pummelling.

### Scoring pummelling game
- +1 for securing and holding double underhooks.
- +1 for brief front headlock/head control.
- +1 for lifting both feet briefly off the mat.
- +1 for forcing a clean hand to touch the floor.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Bending heavily at the waist to swim arms.
- Letting feet come together or cross during exchanges.
- Ignoring head position and allowing partner’s head inside, under your chin.
- Focusing only on arm-swims and ignoring footwork and hip position.
- Letting partner walk to your back without reacting with pivots/steps.
- Treating pummelling as a mindless warm-up with upright posture and lazy arms.
- Letting elbows drift wide so underhooks are given away easily.
- Keeping heads static in the middle instead of actively moving shoulder-to-shoulder.

## 6. Personal Notes (Jerry & Sam – to fill over time)
### Jerry
- Notes:
  - Which side (left/right) feels more comfortable for underhooks?
  - Which pummelling patterns fatigue you fastest?

### Sam
- Notes:
  - What level of pressure feels “training-hard but safe” for Jerry?
  - Which entries (e.g. double underhooks, snap-downs) show up most often?
