# Stand-Ups & Escapes (Four-Point, Turtle and Rear Control)

## Purpose

- Provide a structured “standing escape game” so athletes can return to stance from four-point/turtle without conceding:
  - Hooks and back exposure, or
  - 3-second top control (takedown score aftermath).
- Treat stand-ups as a core no-gi jiu-jitsu competency, not a wrestling specialty.
- Integrate bottom escapes with the standing hierarchy so defence reliably returns to:
  - Safe neutral stance, or
  - Advantage ties (underhook, 2-on-1, front headlock corridor).

## Key Positions

- Four-Point (Bottom Base)

  - Hands and knees on the mat, hips low enough to be stable but not collapsed flat.
  - Elbows tight; hands close, not long posts.
  - Head up and able to turn (seeing opponent and their hip line).

- Referee’s Variants

  - One knee up (base leg) and one knee down.
  - Common transitional shape during stand-ups; often where mat returns and breakdowns occur.

- Turtle (Compact)

  - Knees tucked closer under hips, elbows in.
  - Used to deny immediate points and hooks; must be transitional, not static.

- Rear Waist / Seatbelt Pressure (Bottom Under Ride)

  - Opponent attached from behind with seatbelt/waist, attempting mat returns or breakdowns.
  - Bottom must protect back line and prevent hooks while building to stance.

## Key Cues

- Global Escape Heuristics

  - “Deny hooks first.”
    - Back exposure is the high-value loss; keep elbows tight, protect hip line.
  - “Hands inside, head up.”
    - Long posts create spiral rides and breakdowns; head-down invites neck control and back takes.
  - “Build in layers.”
    - Elbows tight → knee under chest → foot base → turn and face as you rise.
  - “Face before you flee.”
    - Whenever possible, turn-in to face rather than running away and exposing back.

- Four-Point Stand-Up Cues

  - “Knee under chest.”
    - Bring one knee forward under your torso to create a base to rise.
  - “Post the opposite hand.”
    - When you plant a foot, post the opposite hand for stability and back protection.
  - “Turn the corner on the way up.”
    - Rise with an angle, rotating hips so you face the opponent rather than standing square with your back exposed.

- Turtle Safety Cues

  - “Elbows glued, hands short.”
    - Elbows stay near ribs; hands close under shoulders; avoid reaching.
  - “Move before they settle.”
    - If you stay still, top will establish hip ride/seatbelt and breakdowns; your window is early.

- Sit-Out / Turn-In Cues

  - “Clear the hip line.”
    - Sit-out aims to move your hips out from under their pressure and re-face.
  - “Win one underhook or wrist.”
    - The goal is not to spin forever; it is to convert the sit-out to a tie that returns you to advantage ties.

- Granby / Shoulder Roll Cues (Higher Risk Tool)

  - “Use it when they overcommit.”
    - Best when top pressure is heavy and committed to one side; worst when top is balanced and ready to follow.
  - “Re-face at the end.”
    - Granby is not an escape if you roll away and expose back; finish by facing or re-guarding with strong frames.

## Drills & Games

- Layered Stand-Up Drill (Four-Point → Stance)

  - Start: bottom in four-point, top with moderate ride pressure.
  - Bottom sequence:
    - Elbows tight, head up.
    - Knee under chest.
    - Base foot.
    - Opposite hand post.
    - Technical rise to stance while turning to face.
  - Top goal:
    - Provide realistic ride and attempt one mat return, but allow bottom to complete correct structure.
  - Progression:
    - Increase top resistance each week while keeping bottom’s movement sequence intact.

- Mat Return vs Stand-Up Game

  - Start: bottom in referee’s (one knee up), top attached at waist/seatbelt.
  - Bottom score:
    - 1 point for fully standing in safe stance with no hooks and no immediate mat return.
  - Top score:
    - 1 point for each mat return.
    - 2 points for breakdown to hip/side.
    - 3 points for hooks or 3-second top.
  - Forces both sides to work in realistic scrimmage conditions.

- Turtle Escape Rounds

  - Start: bottom in turtle, top in hip ride/seatbelt.
  - Bottom goals:
    - Stand-up to stance, or
    - Turn-in to underhook/2-on-1 and recover advantage ties.
  - Top goals:
    - Break down to hip/side, or
    - Insert hooks / back exposure.
  - Constraint:
    - Bottom is not allowed to simply fall to guard without first attempting a structured stand-up.

- Sit-Out to Tie Drill

  - Start: top has waist/seatbelt; bottom is in four-point.
  - Bottom executes sit-out:
    - Clears hip line.
    - Faces opponent.
    - Immediately captures underhook or wrist (advantage tie).
  - Top tries to follow and re-attach; bottom must “finish” by entering a recognised advantage tie rather than spinning endlessly.

- Granby/Switch Drill (Selective Use)

  - Start: top has heavy hip ride; bottom is pinned in four-point.
  - Bottom:
    - Executes Granby roll or switch when top pressure is clearly on one side.
    - Finishes by re-facing or establishing guard with frames.
  - Coach rule:
    - If bottom Granbys without top overcommitment, it is considered a “bad rep.”

## Common Mistakes

- Long Posting and Reaching

  - Symptom:
    - Bottom posts arms far forward, giving spiral rides and easy breakdowns.
  - Fix:
    - Keep hands short and elbows tight.
    - Emphasise “knee under chest” before long posts.

- Standing Up With Back Exposed

  - Symptom:
    - Bottom rises straight up and runs, exposing hooks and seatbelt control.
  - Fix:
    - Turn and face during rise; prefer turning into underhook/2-on-1 ties.
    - Practise technical stand-ups with a rotational finish, not linear.

- Panic Rolling (Granby as Default)

  - Symptom:
    - Bottom rolls repeatedly regardless of top pressure direction.
  - Fix:
    - Restrict Granby to specific triggers (top overload).
    - Make default escape the layered stand-up and turn-in.

- Treating Turtle as a Static Shelter

  - Symptom:
    - Bottom stays in turtle too long, allowing top to settle.
  - Fix:
    - Make turtle a transitional “pit-stop” only.
    - Train immediate movement: stand-up, sit-out, or turn-in.

- No Conversion at the End

  - Symptom:
    - Bottom almost escapes, gets to knees/one foot, then is dragged back down repeatedly.
  - Fix:
    - Drill the final stage: once one foot is up, you must:
      - Face the opponent, or
      - Capture an advantage tie, or
      - Fully separate to stance.
    - Score stand-ups only when the finish is clean and stable.

## Personal Notes

- Choose your default escape routes
  - From four-point under moderate ride: __________ (layered stand-up / sit-out / turn-in).
  - From turtle with seatbelt: __________ (stand-up route / hip-heist / turn-in).
  - From rear waist control standing: __________ (hand-fighting + turn-in).

- Identify your failure points
  - Are you losing at:
    - Hands position (long posts)?
    - Knee-under-chest stage?
    - Final turn-and-face stage?
    - Getting hooks inserted during rise?

- Training targets for the next block
  - Reduce times you concede hooks during stand-up attempts.
  - Increase percentage of stand-ups that finish into an advantage tie rather than pure neutral.
  - Add one “emergency option” you trust (specific Granby/switch or guard recovery) for worst-case situations.
