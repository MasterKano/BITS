# Reshots (Second-Attack System)

## Purpose

- Make reshots the primary engine of takedown success for no-gi jiu-jitsu athletes who may not win “first shot” exchanges consistently.
- Provide structured, repeatable chains for:
  - Your shot being stuffed (offensive reshots).
  - You defending their shot (defensive reshots).
- Ensure reshots lead into the standing hierarchy’s best outcomes: rear body lock, short offence, strong front headlock, and clean aftermath scoring.

## Key Positions

- Stuffed Primary Shot (Your Shot Stalls)

  - Your hands still connected to legs/hips or your tie is still meaningful.
  - Your head is up and your posture is not completely collapsed.
  - Opponent’s stance is compromised by their own sprawl/defence (feet wide, weight forward, hands posting).

- Defensive Conversion Shells (After You Defend Their Shot)

  - Sprawl shell: hips heavy, angled off-line.
  - Short offence: chest-on-back, knee inserted.
  - Front headlock corridor: head/arm controlled with posture, feeding snaps/spins.
  - Back angle: you have turned the corner and can claim rear body lock or go-behind.

- Broken Stance Window

  - The brief moment when opponent is:
    - Rising from a shot.
    - Rebuilding stance with feet square.
    - Posting hands to the mat.
    - Turning to face after a failed finish.
  - This is the green light for reshots.

## Key Cues

- Global Reshot Heuristics

  - “Shots are hard; reshots are easy.”
    - First shots attack a good stance; reshots attack a stance already broken.
  - “Head up, hands connected, then decide.”
    - If posture is good and grips are live, you are still in the exchange.
    - If posture is broken and grips are gone, exit and reset.
  - “Angle changes win reshots.”
    - A reshot is rarely the exact same shot on the exact same line; change angle, leg, or level of control.

- Your Shot Is Stuffed (Offensive Reshots)

  - “If you can pivot, you can reshoot.”
    - Pivot around their sprawl pressure to find a new lane.
  - “Chase the second leg or climb.”
    - If first leg is defended:
      - Drop to ankle/knee and catch the other leg (switch).
      - Or climb up to body lock/front headlock rather than forcing a dying grip.
  - “Reshoot before they rebuild stance.”
    - The best timing is as they sprawl and post; if they are standing tall again, reset.

- You Defend Their Shot (Defensive Reshots)

  - “Defend → convert → attack.”
    - Defence is not the end; it is the start of a counter sequence.
  - “Hands touch mat = short offence.”
    - When your defence forces their hands to post, chest slides to back and knee goes in.
  - “Standing up badly = reshot.”
    - If they rise with feet square, hips high, or hands extended, shoot immediately or climb to body lock.

- Exit Rules (Non-Negotiable)

  - Exit if:
    - Your head is driven down and cannot come up.
    - You are crossfaced/whizzered into broken posture.
    - You are losing balance and exposing back.
  - Exit means:
    - Clear grips.
    - Rebuild stance.
    - Re-enter via advantage ties (not random long shots).

## Drills & Games

- Offensive Reshot Drills (Your Shot Is Stuffed)

  - Double → Pivot → Double (Angle Reshoot)
    - A shoots double; B sprawls with controlled pressure.
    - A keeps head up, pivots to a side, re-penetrates on new line.
    - Finish to top and immediately run aftermath branch.

  - Single → Switch to Second Leg
    - A shoots single; B defends by turning knee out and sprawling.
    - A drops to ankle/knee, catches other leg (or backside double), then finishes.
    - Emphasise timing: reshoot while B is still “posted.”

  - Stuffed Shot → Climb to Body Lock
    - A shoots; B stuffs and starts to pummel or whizzer.
    - A abandons legs upward:
      - Head up.
      - Underhook/waist control.
      - Transition to body lock or rear body lock if corner won.

- Defensive Reshot Drills (After You Defend Their Shot)

  - Sprawl → Short Offence → Go-Behind
    - B shoots; A sprawls and forces hands to mat.
    - A slides chest to back, inserts knee, establishes double pits.
    - A circles to rear body lock and finishes.

  - Limp-Leg → Back Angle → Rear Body Lock
    - B shoots high single; A posts head down/outside, lifts knee, limp-legs free.
    - As leg clears, A turns corner to back angle and locks rear body lock.
    - A finishes with controlled trip/mat return.

  - Sprawl → Front Headlock → Snap → Reshot
    - B shoots; A sprawls and transitions to front headlock corridor.
    - A snaps B to hands, then:
      - Either converts to short offence, or
      - Hits immediate reshot as B rises into square stance.

- Constraint Sparring Games

  - “Reshots Only” Round
    - No primary shots from perfect stance allowed.
    - You may shoot only after:
      - A previous attempt was stuffed, or
      - You defended a shot, or
      - Opponent’s stance is clearly compromised.
    - Forces timing and angle sense.

  - “Two-Attack Rule”
    - Every takedown attempt must be followed by a second attack:
      - Reshot, climb, go-behind, or front headlock conversion.
    - If you stop after the first attempt, you lose the exchange.

  - “Exit Discipline” Round
    - Coach calls “exit” when posture breaks.
    - Athlete must clear grips and reset immediately (no stubborn dying shots).
    - Builds risk control under fatigue.

## Common Mistakes

- Dying on the First Shot

  - Symptom:
    - Athlete stays on a defended leg with head down and posture collapsed.
  - Consequences:
    - Guillotines, back exposure, fatigue, poor scramble outcomes.
  - Fix:
    - Install exit rules and “climb or reshoot” reflex.
    - Drill pivot reshoots as the automatic second beat.

- Reshooting on the Same Line

  - Symptom:
    - Athlete repeats the same shot down the same lane that just failed.
  - Consequences:
    - Predictable; defender easily repeats defence.
  - Fix:
    - Mandatory angle change: every reshot must involve pivot, switch leg, or climb to torso.

- Missing the Timing Window

  - Symptom:
    - Athlete delays until opponent has fully rebuilt stance.
  - Consequences:
    - Reshot becomes another low-quality first shot.
  - Fix:
    - Reshot while opponent is posted, rising, or square-footed.
    - Add drills where defender “locks out” stance after 2 seconds; if reshot is late, rep is failed.

- Confusing Reshots with Endless Shots

  - Symptom:
    - Athlete attacks repeatedly without structure, never climbing, never exiting.
  - Consequences:
    - Bad posture, high risk, chaotic scrambles.
  - Fix:
    - Define chain length:
      - Attack 1 → Attack 2 (reshot or climb) → finish or exit.
    - Treat “attack 3+” as an exception, not plan.

## Personal Notes

- Select your A-game reshot chains:
  - Offence:
    - “Stuffed double → pivot left → reshoot double → finish to strong half.”
    - “Stuffed single → switch to second leg → backside double → mat return.”
  - Defence:
    - “Sprawl → short offence → go-behind → rear body lock.”
    - “Limp-leg → turn corner → rear body lock.”

- Track your reshot timing:
  - Are you shooting while they are posted and compromised, or after they stand tall?
  - Do you reshoot with angle changes or repeat the same lane?

- Post-block review:
  - Count how many takedown scores in sparring came from reshots vs first shots.
  - If reshots are not producing scores, diagnose:
    - Is posture breaking (exit discipline problem)?
    - Is timing late (window recognition problem)?
    - Are you failing to upgrade to rear body lock/short offence after reshot (conversion problem)?
