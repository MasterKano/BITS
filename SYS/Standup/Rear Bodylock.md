# Standing Rear Body Lock

## Purpose

- Establish standing rear body lock as a primary “gold-standard” control shell in the stand-up phase, analogous to back control on the ground.
- Provide a structured set of entries, controls and finishes that convert rear body lock into low-risk, high-control takedowns and back-exposure outcomes for no-gi jiu-jitsu.
- Integrate rear body lock into the broader standing hierarchy so athletes seek it proactively from advantage ties, sprawls and scrimmage situations, not as a rare accident.

## Key Positions

- Core Rear Body Lock (Standard)
  - Your chest on opponent’s back, head near the back of the head/shoulder line.
  - Hands locked around the waist or lower torso (gable grip, S-grip or wrist-over-wrist).
  - Elbows close to your own ribs, forearms wrapping around their body rather than “hugging” high up on the chest.
  - Your stance slightly offset to one side (not perfectly centred), knees bent, hips close to their hips.

- High Rear Body Lock
  - Hands locked higher on ribs or chest when the waist is not yet available.
  - Transitional variant used while “walking the lock down” to the lumbar region.
  - More vulnerable to granby-style and turn-in escapes; treated as a short-lived intermediate.

- Side-Offset Rear Body Lock
  - Your chest slightly to one side of their spine, hips still lined up behind theirs.
  - Used to reduce their throwing and rolling options and set angles for reverse trips, side lifts and mat returns.
  - Often created deliberately by “steering” them with head and lock while circling your feet.

- Rear Body Lock to Hip Ride (Transitional)
  - Opponent begins to drop to turtle or four-point to avoid clean throw or back exposure.
  - Your lock opens and transitions to seatbelt, hip ride or waist ride with knees on the mat.
  - Treated as the link from standing rear body lock into short offence, breakdowns and back-take chains.

## Key Cues

- Acquisition Cues
  - “If you can see the back, you should be on it.”
    - Any time you angle behind the shoulder line, default intention is to close hands around the waist, not rest in side-clinch.
  - From arm drags/throw-bys:
    - “Step past the hip, then connect hands.”
    - Feet go first, hands second; don’t drag without turning the corner.
  - From limp-leg and defended shots:
    - “As your leg comes free, turn the corner and lock.”
    - Use their extended grip and square stance to claim the back line before disengaging.

- Structural Cues
  - “Lock low, head in line, hips close.”
    - Hands move down toward lumbar, not drift up towards the armpits.
    - Head stays roughly behind their head/shoulder, not hanging far to one side.
    - Your hips never wander far behind theirs; you sit into their stance.
  - “Long arm / short arm.”
    - One elbow more extended, one more bent, to create unequal pressure on their hips and reduce turn-in options.
    - Shoulders slightly rotated toward your “short arm” side.

- Control and Finish Cues
  - “Walk, off-balance, then drop.”
    - First, walk them a few steps to disrupt stance and read reactions.
    - Second, use small off-balances (shoulder bumps, lock twists) to put weight on one leg.
    - Third, select low-amplitude finish (reverse trip, reap, side lift) when their base is compromised.
  - “Hips over heels, not head over heels.”
    - Goal is to put their hips and shoulders behind their heels and let them fall or sit, not to throw them overhead.
  - After landing:
    - “Chest stays attached.”
    - Do not allow your upper body to separate from their back during the fall.

## Drills & Games

- Technical Entries Series (Low Resistance)
  - Arm-Drag to Rear Body Lock
    - From collar-and-wrist:
      - A gains wrist–elbow, drags across centre, steps outside near leg, and connects hands at waist.
      - B gives realistic posture and mild resistance to turning.
    - Variations:
      - Same-side and cross-wrist drags.
      - From moving stance, not static.
  - Throw-By / Slide-By to Rear Body Lock
    - From over/under or heavy collar tie:
      - A “opens the door” with a small step and throw-by, then immediately steps into back space and closes lock.

- Rear Body Lock Retention and Adjustment
  - Static retention rounds:
    - Start with A in full rear body lock, B tries to escape (hip heist, turn-in, granby) at 30–50% effort.
    - A’s task:
      - Keep chest on back and hands locked.
      - Walk lock down from high to low.
      - Adjust stance and head position to follow.
  - Angle and offset drill:
    - A begins behind B in square rear body lock.
    - On cue, A must step to offset stance (slightly left or right), then B tries a chosen escape.
    - A learns which offsets reduce each escape option.

- Finish Families (Isolated)
  - Reverse Trip Series
    - Start with A in rear body lock, small circle step to one side.
    - A blocks or reaps the near leg while twisting lock, guiding B to hands/hip rather than throwing.
    - Emphasise maintaining chest-to-back at landing.
  - Side-Lift and Knee-Drop Series
    - Start with B widening stance and leaning to avoid trips.
    - A closes hips, loads B slightly, then steps or knee-drops to gently put B down while riding the waist.
    - Landings must finish in either:
      - Hip ride / seatbelt / back exposure, or
      - Strong half/side with head-over-head, not loose top.

- Situational Games
  - “Three Seconds to Lock”
    - Start from various angles (e.g. post-sprawl, drag angle, limp-leg angle).
    - A has 3 seconds to close a rear body lock; if they fail, B resets to fully square stance.
  - “Rear Body Lock Only Takedowns”
    - Constraint: A may only attempt takedowns if they first achieve rear body lock.
    - Forces prioritisation of entries and control before finishing.

## Common Mistakes

- High, Loose Lock
  - Hands locked around chest or ribs with big gaps.
  - Leads to easy granby rolls, turn-ins, and arm-trap escapes.
  - Correction:
    - Immediately “walk the lock down” toward the waist.
    - Tighten elbows and stick chest to back before thinking about finishes.

- Crowding the Upper Body, Ignoring Hips
  - Squeezing upper torso while leaving hips far behind.
  - Opponent can drop hips, widen stance and peel grip.
  - Correction:
    - Focus first on closing hip distance; your belt line should be near theirs.
    - Use your feet and knees to track their hips, not just your arms.

- Throw Hunting
  - Trying high-amplitude suplex-style finishes or big backward arches.
  - Increases risk to neck, shoulders and positional loss if they scramble.
  - Correction:
    - Default to reverse trips, reaps and controlled side-lifts.
    - Rehearse low-amplitude finishes until they are automatic.

- Failing to Anticipate Turtle / Drop Escapes
  - Opponent dives to knees or sits to avoid being thrown; top player hesitates and loses connection.
  - Correction:
    - Expect drop escapes; as soon as their knees bend or hips lower, prepare to:
      - Follow to hip ride or seatbelt, or
      - Transition straight to short offence.

- Holding Without Progress
  - Staying in rear body lock for long periods without moving toward finish or back exposure.
  - Fatigues arms and wastes positional advantage.
  - Correction:
    - Use the “walk, off-balance, drop” cycle:
      - If no progress after a few steps, change direction or switch to seatbelt/hip ride breakdowns.

## Personal Notes

- Record your main rear body lock acquisition paths:
  - From advantage ties:
    - e.g. “Collar-and-wrist → arm drag → RBL (right side)”
    - e.g. “Over/under → throw-by → RBL (left side)”
  - From defence:
    - e.g. “High single defence → limp-leg → turn corner → RBL”
    - e.g. “Sprawl → short offence → go-behind → RBL”

- Define your A-game finishes:
  - “If they lean forward, I prefer __________.”
  - “If they stand tall or try to run, I prefer __________.”
  - “If they drop to knees/turtle, I flow into __________ (hip ride/seatbelt/short offence).”

- Post-block review prompts:
  - How often do you actually reach rear body lock in live rounds?
  - When you do, what typically happens:
    - Immediate escape?
    - Controlled finish to top?
    - Scramble with mixed outcomes?
  - Which specific escape or counter from training partners gives you the most trouble?
    - Note them here and plan focused retention and counter-drills around those reactions in the next block.
