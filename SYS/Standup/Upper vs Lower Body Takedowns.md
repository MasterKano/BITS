# Standup Strategy - Upper Vs Lower Body Takedowns

## Key Positions / Structures
- Leg-tackle endpoint: chest-to-thigh control with hands around the legs, head often low and spine extended.
- Scoring positions in Jiu Jitsu: chest-to-chest pin, chest-to-back/back exposure, or control over hips/back with opponent on their two hips or majority of back on the mat for ~3 seconds.
- Upper-body takedowns start and end in upper-body control: chest-to-chest or chest-to-back both before and after the takedown.

## Key Cues
- “Leg tackles start chest-to-thigh; scores come from chest-to-chest or chest-to-back.”
- “The scramble between legs and chest is where scores are lost.”
- “Begin in the position that scores, then throw from there.”
- “Upper body control comes first before the takedown.”

## Drills & Games
- Contrast drill:
  - Group A: Start from shot position (chest-to-thigh) and climb to chest-to-chest/back, trying to hold a clear 3-second pin.
  - Group B: Start from chest-to-chest clinch and execute simple forward throws into pin, then hold 3 seconds.
  - Afterwards, compare effort, reliability, and exposure in each path.

## Common Mistakes
 Treating “any knockdown” as equivalent to a scoring takedown, without controlling the 3-second criteria.
- Focusing on leg attacks without a clear plan for the transition from legs to chest/back control.
