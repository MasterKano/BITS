# Four-Point Breakdowns (Top)

## Purpose

- Provide a repeatable breakdown system from turtle, four-point and referee’s positions that converts chest-on-back control into:
  - Back exposure (hooks/seatbelt), or
  - Stable top control (side/strong half) for scoring.
- Establish four-point top as a primary scoring hub in no-gi jiu-jitsu, not merely a holding position.
- Integrate breakdowns with short offence, rear body lock mat returns and aftermath branches so the top player can keep opponents down and deny stand-ups.

## Key Positions

- Four-Point / Referee’s (Top Base)

  - Your chest over the opponent’s shoulder line (upper back), not directly over hips.
  - Your hips behind their hips, with at least one knee on the mat for anchoring.
  - Your head stays above or level with theirs to avoid being rolled or head-snapped.

- Spiral Ride

  - One hand controlling near hip/waist.
  - Other hand controlling far elbow/shoulder line.
  - Your knee (near-side) wedges near or between their knees to limit hip rotation.
  - Used to rotate shoulders and collapse posts.

- Shoelace / Ankle Control

  - Your instep hooks over or controls the opponent’s near ankle (“shoelace” style).
  - Combined with upper-body pressure to remove the near post and shorten their base.
  - Forces knee collapse or hip roll when applied correctly.

- Seatbelt / Claw Ride (Hip Ride)

  - Seatbelt: one arm over shoulder, one under armpit, hands connected.
  - Claw: hand cupping or clawing near shoulder/lat to steer posture.
  - Used to:
    - Prevent stand-ups.
    - Tilt hips.
    - Create safe back exposure without chasing hooks too early.

- Near-Hip Clamp to Pin Conversion (Transitional)

  - You collapse them to a hip/side, then immediately:
    - Slide your hips across belt line into strong half/side.
    - Or attach seatbelt and insert first hook.
  - Treated as the scoring bridge: breakdown is not complete until conversion is secured.

## Key Cues

- Global Breakdown Cues

  - “Break posts before you chase hooks.”
    - Remove hands/elbows from the mat first; hooks are easier once the base is gone.
  - “Shoulders lead hips.”
    - Turn their shoulders first; hips follow. If you push only hips, they can tripod and stand.
  - “Keep your chest on the upper back.”
    - If you float above hips or head, you lose leverage and give them space to stand or roll.

- Spiral Ride Cues

  - “Hip hand pulls; shoulder hand turns.”
    - Near hip hand draws hips in and down.
    - Far shoulder/elbow hand rotates shoulders to collapse the near post.
  - “Collapse the near elbow.”
    - The goal is to remove the near elbow/hand from the mat, not to muscle-roll the whole body.
  - “Steer them to a hip, not to their back immediately.”
    - Hip exposure is the intermediate; from hip you can either take back or settle top.

- Shoelace / Ankle Control Cues

  - “Trap the ankle, then drive hips forward.”
    - Your instep hooks the near ankle; your hip pressure moves forward to shorten their base.
  - “Remove the far post second.”
    - Once ankle is trapped, use upper body to peel or steer the far arm; they cannot post well when base is shortened.
  - “If they try to stand, mat return.”
    - Shoelace often triggers stand attempts; be ready to convert to seatbelt/hip ride and return them to four-point.

- Seatbelt / Claw Ride Cues

  - “Seatbelt first, hook later.”
    - Stabilise chest-to-back and hip alignment; only then hunt hook.
  - “Follow the hips, not the head.”
    - Their head can fake turns; hips tell the truth about stand-ups and escapes.
  - “Make them carry you.”
    - Use your weight and attachment so that any stand-up attempt becomes a burden.

- Conversion Cues (After Breakdown)

  - “Three-second rule.”
    - Once you break them to side/hip, immediately secure:
      - Stable top for count, or
      - Clear back exposure with seatbelt/hook.
  - “Legs first.”
    - Step over or staple a leg to block guard recovery before settling chest-to-chest.

## Drills & Games

- Spiral Breakdown Series (Isolated)

  - Static spiral drill
    - Start in spiral ride.
    - Goal: collapse near elbow and turn them to hip.
    - Freeze at end position; check:
      - chest on upper back, knee wedge, hip hand engaged.
  - Spiral to conversion
    - Same breakdown, but must finish with either:
      - Side control/strong half (≥3s), or
      - Seatbelt + first hook attempt.

- Shoelace Breakdown Series (Isolated)

  - Shoelace trap drill
    - Start with opponent on four-point.
    - Hook near ankle with instep.
    - Apply hip pressure forward and rotate shoulders to collapse.
  - Shoelace → mat return game
    - Bottom player’s only goal is to stand.
    - Top player’s goal is to keep shoelace/seatbelt contact and return them to four-point repeatedly.

- Seatbelt / Hip Ride Series

  - Ride to breakdown
    - Start with seatbelt and hip ride on turtle.
    - Goal: tilt them to hip and insert first hook or settle half/side.
  - Ride retention rounds
    - Bottom tries: stand-up, sit-out, granby.
    - Top scores:
      - +1 each successful mat return.
      - +2 each breakdown to hip.
      - +3 for hooks or 3s top.

- Constraint Sparring Games

  - “Posts are Points”
    - Bottom starts in four-point.
    - Every time bottom re-establishes a strong post (both hands planted firmly), they get a point.
    - Top scores by removing posts and converting to hook/top.
    - Forces top to prioritise post removal rather than “hanging.”

  - “One Breakdown, One Conversion”
    - Top is only allowed one breakdown attempt per exchange.
    - If breakdown fails, reset.
    - Builds precision and efficiency; reduces sloppy multi-attempt scrambles.

  - “No Hooks Until Hip”
    - Top cannot insert hooks until bottom is on a hip or elbow is collapsed.
    - Forces the correct order: breakdown → hip exposure → hooks.

## Common Mistakes

- Chasing Hooks Too Early

  - Symptom:
    - Top tries to insert hooks while bottom still has strong hands and elbows posted.
  - Consequences:
    - Bottom stands, shakes off, or rolls; top loses control.
  - Fix:
    - Install “posts before hooks” rule in drilling and sparring.

- Riding Too High (Over the Shoulders Only)

  - Symptom:
    - Top controls shoulders but does not control hips; bottom runs, stands or sits out.
  - Consequences:
    - Mat returns and breakdowns fail; exchange resets.
  - Fix:
    - Always include a hip connection (hip hand, seatbelt underhook, shoelace) before trying to turn.

- Pushing Hips Without Turning Shoulders

  - Symptom:
    - Top tries to shove hips sideways while shoulders remain square.
  - Consequences:
    - Bottom posts and resists; no collapse happens.
  - Fix:
    - Use spiral ride logic: shoulders lead, hips follow.

- Poor Knee Wedge

  - Symptom:
    - Top keeps both knees far away; bottom rotates hips freely and stands.
  - Consequences:
    - No control of base; breakdown attempts feel like “arm wrestling.”
  - Fix:
    - Insert near knee between or near their knees to block hip rotation and shorten base.

- Breakdown Without Conversion

  - Symptom:
    - Top gets them to a hip but then pauses or loses leg control; bottom re-guards or stands.
  - Consequences:
    - Breakdowns feel ineffective; scoring never happens.
  - Fix:
    - Drill breakdown + immediate conversion as a single unit:
      - Hip → step-over/staple → side/half or hook.

## Personal Notes

- Pick your primary breakdowns
  - Spiral: left and right.
  - Shoelace: left and right.
  - Seatbelt/hip ride: preferred side for hook insertion.

- Define your default conversion
  - “When I break them to hip, I default to __________ (strong half / side / hook).”
  - “If they stand, I default to __________ (mat return family).”

- Troubleshooting log
  - Which escape do partners hit most against you from four-point?
    - Stand-up? sit-out? granby? turn-in?
  - For each, record:
    - What grip or connection you were missing.
    - Which cue would have prevented it (knee wedge, hip hand, shoulders-first, etc.).
