# Hip Jousting

## 1. Purpose
- Use hip jousting as the second core training method to connect clinch ties to hip position and throw direction.
- Develop instinctive hip checks and shoulder–hip awareness so you never offer an “empty space” for the opponent to step into.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Base configuration
- One athlete with underhook or tight waist.
- Other with strong whizzer.
- Both in solid stance with mobile hips.

### Hip check
- As partner steps their hips into the space in front of you, your hip moves first to occupy and touch theirs.
- Shoulder–hip relationship defines whether you are set up for:
  - Forward throws (when their shoulders are forward over empty space).
  - Backward or lateral throws (when their hips drive in under their shoulders).

### Throw direction mapping
- Shoulders over toes / head forward:
  - Forward-direction throws (e.g. Sumi/Ude from front headlock, certain hip throws).
- Hips deeply under you / shoulders back:
  - Backward/lateral throws (e.g. Uki Waza, lateral drops).

### Underhook–whizzer engine
- Underhook player:
  - Uses hip checks to create leverage for hip throws and trips.
- Whizzer player:
  - Tries to drive hips in and force entries the other way.

## 3. Key Cues
- “Never present empty space in front of your hips.”
- “When they step in, your hip gets there first.”
- “Shoulders in front of hips = forward throw; shoulders behind hips = backward/lateral throw.”
- “Hip check is your upper-body sprawl.”
- “Throws start from where hips meet, not from the hands.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Static hip check drill
- Start in underhook–whizzer.
- Whizzer player repeatedly steps hips into the gap.
- Underhook player’s job:
  - Meet every step with a firm hip check.
  - Maintain balance and stance.

### Semi-live hip jousting
- Same tie, but both can move feet and adjust grips.
- Whizzer player hunts entries by stepping in and changing stance.
- Underhook player:
  - Hip checks each entry.
  - Starts to add small off-balances and directional steps (without throws at first).

### Direction decision game
- Partner alternates between:
  - Head and shoulders forward, hips back.
  - Hips in deep, shoulders slightly back.
- After a clean hip check, you must choose:
  - Forward-direction throw family when shoulders are forward.
  - Backwards/lateral-direction throw family when hips are in.
- Early on, just call the direction out loud; later integrate actual entries.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Leaving a big gap in front of the hips for the opponent to occupy.
- Leaning shoulders far over empty space, making yourself easy to launch.
- Trying to fight only with arms and grips while ignoring hip position.
- Letting hip jousting become another “loose warm-up drill” instead of a live decision-making exercise.
