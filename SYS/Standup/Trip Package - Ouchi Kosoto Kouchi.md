# Trip Package – Ouchi / Kosoto / Kouchi

## 1. Purpose
- Provide a low-impact, high-control set of trips that pair with upper body ties (over/under, pinch HL, front HL, body lock).
- Give older or smaller athletes a consistent way to finish clinch exchanges without big lifts or spins.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Shared upper-body requirement
- You must have:
  - A stable tie (over/under, pinch HL, front HL, body lock).
  - Head close to their chest/shoulder line.
  - Hips close – no long reach with the leg.

### Ouchi Gari (major inside trip)
- Your reaping leg:
  - Steps inside their stance line.
  - Hooks or reaps their inner thigh/calf from the rear.
- Body alignment:
  - Your chest turned slightly to throw side.
  - Upper body driving them straight back or on a slight diagonal.

### Kosoto Gari (small outer reap)
- Your reaping leg:
  - Contacts the outside of their heel/calf.
  - Reaps or “wipes” their foot off the mat.
- Body alignment:
  - Usually done when their weight is on that foot.
  - Upper body pulls or twists them over the reaped leg.

### Kouchi Gari (small inside trip)
- Your reaping leg:
  - Targets the inside of their foot/ankle.
  - Short, sharp reap travelling along the mat.
- Body alignment:
  - Works well when they step forward into you.
  - Upper body guides their weight onto the target leg just before reaping.

## 3. Key Cues
- “Trips come from upper body first, leg second.”
- “Close the hip gap before you reach with the foot.”
- “Load their weight onto the target leg, then reap.”
- “Ouchi: big inside line. Kosoto: outside wipe. Kouchi: small inside knife.”
- “Keep your chest over their chest; don’t lean away from your own trip.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Patterning drill – each trip alone
- From static over/under or body lock:
  - Ouchi:
    - Step in, close hip, inside reap their far leg; reset.
  - Kosoto:
    - Encourage them to step; time a small outside reap on their stepping leg.
  - Kouchi:
    - As they step forward, place your foot inside and reap the heel/ankle along the mat.
- Run each for 10–15 clean reps per side.
