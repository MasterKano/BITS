# Older Athlete Throwing Package

## 1. Purpose
- Package the lower-impact, structure-based throws and counters from the instructional into a coherent subsystem for older, less explosive, or injury-conscious athletes.
- Make sure this subsystem still connects directly to pins, back takes, and submissions.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Safe, structural ties
- Front headlock and cow catcher.
- Pinch headlock (head-and-arm, not pure headlock).
- Over/under with good stance and hip connection.
- Double unders/body lock with upright spine.

### Low-impact throw families
- Cow catcher (from HL).
- Sumi/Ude Gaeshi (from deep shots or front HL/lat control).
- Uki Waza (from overhook/over–under).
- Conservative trips (Kouchi, Ouchi, Kosoto) with strong upper-body control.

### Safe landings
- Emphasis on side-falls and rolling finishes rather than big hip elevation and rotation.

## 3. Key Cues
- “Let them drive into your structure; don’t chase huge lifts.”
- “Throw from strong ties, not from desperation reaches.”
- “Prefer sacrifice throws and trips where your body stays compact.”
- “Never take a high-risk throw if a low-risk pin from cow catcher is available.”
- “Build your plan around control → throw → 3-second hold, not around amplitude.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Older athlete menu drill
- From neutral clinch, only the following are allowed:
  - Cow catcher.
  - Sumi/Ude Gaeshi from shots.
  - Uki Waza from overhook.
  - Kouchi/Ouchi/Kosoto from stable ties.
- Practise chaining between them as the partner changes resistance.

### “Structural win” rounds
- Moderate-intensity standup.
- Score only counts if:
  - You used one of the package options.
  - You finished in a clear pin/back/HL control.
- No big amplitude hip throws for score; this keeps behaviour aligned with the package.

### Landings focus
- Start from mid-throw positions (half-completed sacrifice or trip).
- Practise safe transitions to top control:
  - Side falls.
  - Shoulder rolls where appropriate.
  - Immediate chest-to-chest/back attachments.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Trying to copy young, explosive hip throws when structural throws are available.
- Ignoring cow catcher and front HL as primary scoring tools.
- Over-rotating in sacrifice throws and exposing ribs/back to counters.
- Treating the “older athlete” package as a limitation rather than a highly efficient, low-risk option.
