# Leg Tackle Defence (Sprawl, Limp-Leg & Counter-Offence)

## Purpose

- Provide a structured defensive system against singles, doubles and high-crotch leg attacks in no-gi jiu-jitsu.
- Make it difficult for opponents to score clean takedowns or back exposure even when they have strong wrestling.
- Turn defence into offence by converting sprawls and limp-leg escapes into short offence, rear body lock and front headlock attacks.
- Integrate leg-tackle defence into the broader standing hierarchy and scrimmage/aftermath framework.

## Key Positions

- Defensive Stance & Head/Hands Shell

  - Weight-bearing wrestling stance:
    - Feet shoulder-width or slightly wider.
    - Knees bent, hips back, torso inclined but not folded.
  - Hands inside and in front of hips as “first line” against shots.
  - Head level lower than opponent’s but still structurally strong (not bent at waist).

- Sprawl Shell

  - Hips dropped sharply over opponent’s upper back/shoulders, not mid-spine.
  - Legs extended back and slightly to the side (angled sprawl), toes on the mat.
  - Chest off the head/neck, hands posting on shoulders/upper back or the mat for balance.
  - Head high and off-line, looking to a side rather than straight down.

- Limp-Leg Shell (vs Single / High Crotch)

  - Opponent controls leg high on thigh or above knee.
  - Your hands are on head/neck/shoulders, pushing their head down and to the outside.
  - Your knee is lifted above their grip line; your hip turned so the knee points out.
  - Your base leg is strong and bent; torso upright enough to support rotation.

- Short Offence & Go-Behind (Defence-to-Offence Transition)

  - After successful sprawl or limp-leg:
    - Chest moves from head to upper back.
    - At least one knee is inserted between/inside their knees.
    - Hands move to double pits, spiral ride or early rear body lock.

## Key Cues

- Global Defensive Cues

  - “See the shot early.”
    - Hands and head in front of hips; no long reaching for collars that open straight lines to legs.
    - Constant small level changes to avoid being a static target.
  - “First layer: stop penetration; second: win angle; third: counter.”
    - Do not jump straight to counters until penetration and angle are under control.

- Sprawl Cues

  - “Hips heavy, not chest heavy.”
    - Think of dropping your belt onto their upper back, not your chest onto their shoulders.
  - “Sprawl along a diagonal.”
    - Step/sprawl slightly to one side so their head and hips are forced off the original line.
  - “Chest off neck, onto back.”
    - Once shot is slowed, move chest from back of head to upper back; neck-hanging is transitional only.
  - “Head up, hands live.”
    - Keep your own head higher than theirs; hands free to post, crossface, spin or pummel.

- Limp-Leg Cues

  - “Head down, knee up, then rotate.”
    - Push their head down/outside with both hands.
    - Lift your knee above their grip line (thigh roughly parallel to floor).
    - Rotate knee outward and then down so lower leg “slips” free.
  - “Turn the corner as you free the leg.”
    - Do not simply drop the leg back; step it behind them or out to an angle.
    - Aim to land in rear body lock, two-on-one or strong stance, not square in front again.
  - “Time it as they rise or adjust.”
    - Limp-leg when they transition, not when fully set; catch them between base changes.

- Counter-Offence Cues

  - “Defence is a bridge, not a destination.”
    - After a good sprawl, short offence or spin-behind should follow immediately.
    - After a limp-leg, turn the corner to back/tie rather than just resetting to long distance.
  - “If their hands touch the mat, think short offence.”
    - Sprawl/snap until they post; as soon as they do, drop chest to back and insert knee.
  - “If they stand tall after a failed shot, think reshot.”
    - Use their bad stance and extended posture for your own leg entry or body lock.

## Drills & Games

- Technical Defence Drills

  - Sprawl Fundamentals
    - Partner shoots at 30–50% speed; defender focusses on:
      - Level drop (no jump-sprawls).
      - Hips over upper back.
      - Angled sprawl to a chosen side.
    - Add progression:
      - Static starts → moving stance → light hand-fight into shot.

  - Sprawl-to-Short-Offence
    - Same starting point, but every successful sprawl must end in:
      - Chest sliding from head to upper back.
      - Knee insertion between their knees.
      - Establishment of double pits or spiral ride.
    - Freeze and check body alignment each rep.

  - Limp-Leg Mechanics
    - From high single/higher leg control:
      - Defender posts on head/neck, lifts knee above grip line.
      - Rotates knee outward, then down; leg lands behind attacker or at an angle.
    - Begin static, then add movement and resistance on the grip.

  - Limp-Leg-to-Back-Take / Tie
    - Same limp-leg pattern, but every escape must finish with:
      - Rear body lock, OR
      - Two-on-one with strong stance, OR
      - Underhook + head position.
    - No reps ending in neutral square stance.

- Positional Sparring

  - “Shooter vs Defender” Rounds
    - A: only allowed to attack with singles/doubles/high crotch.
    - B: only allowed to defend and counter (no primary shots).
    - Goals:
      - B denies clean scores and back exposure.
      - B converts as many defences as possible into short offence or rear body lock.
    - Swap roles after each round.

  - Deep-Shot Defence Rounds
    - Start with B already deep on a single/double (worst-case entries).
    - A must:
      - Sprawl/hip-drop or limp-leg.
      - Then either:
        - Stand to neutral safely, or
        - Convert to short offence / rear body lock.
    - Helps train composure after mistakes.

  - “No Panic Submissions” Constraint
    - Same as previous rounds, but:
      - Defender cannot attack guillotines, kimuras or leg locks unless:
        - Shot is fully slowed.
        - Head and hips are structurally safe.
      - Coach calls out any “panic submission” attempts and resets with a penalty.

## Common Mistakes

- Sprawling with Hips Too High

  - Symptom:
    - Chest down, hips not fully committed; attacker continues driving and finishes on knees.
  - Consequences:
    - You get run down into takedown/back exposure.
  - Fix:
    - Focus drills on hip commitment: imagine trying to put belt on the back of their neck.
    - Keep a slight diagonal angle to reduce their driving lane.

- Diving Forward with Broken Posture

  - Symptom:
    - Defender throws chest forward without lowering hips, head drops below attacker’s hips.
  - Consequences:
    - Easy reshots for attacker.
    - Neck and back exposure.
  - Fix:
    - Practice level changes without upper-body collapse.
    - Emphasise “hips back first, then chest if needed.”

- Limp-Legging from the Wrong Grips

  - Symptom:
    - Trying to limp-leg when attacker’s grip is low on ankle/calf or when their head is in strong position.
  - Consequences:
    - Gets picked up, takes hard dumps or loses balance.
  - Fix:
    - Only attempt limp-leg when:
      - Grip is high on thigh or above knee.
      - You have meaningful head control (pushing head down/outside).
    - In other cases, prioritise sprawl/hip-drop and hand fighting.

- Escaping then Resetting to Raw Neutral

  - Symptom:
    - After a good sprawl or limp-leg, defender backs away to long distance instead of upgrading to attack.
  - Consequences:
    - Lost opportunities to exploit compromised stance.
  - Fix:
    - Build automatic follow-ups:
      - Sprawl → short offence or go-behind.
      - Limp-leg → back-take or strong tie.
    - Use scoring in training that rewards conversions, not just “not getting taken down.”

- Fishing for Submissions During Bad Defence

  - Symptom:
    - Defender jumps guillotines, kimuras or falls back on legs while being driven or with head/hips out of position.
  - Consequences:
    - High rate of conceded takedowns and back-takes; dangerous habits under pressure.
  - Fix:
    - Enforcement rule: if your head is below their hips, no submissions.
    - Drill submission layers only after establishing stable sprawl/short-offence/posture.

## Personal Notes

- Track which shots give you most trouble:
  - Head-inside singles?
  - Doubles with strong penetration?
  - High crotches or snatch singles from tie-ups?

- Define your default responses:
  - “When they shoot double from distance, I default to __________.”
  - “When they get high single, I default to __________.”
  - “When my first sprawl fails, my next move is __________.”

- Competition-oriented reflections:
  - In recent rounds or matches:
    - How many takedown attempts against you turned into clean scores?
    - How often did you turn defence into short offence or rear body lock?
  - Use these answers to adjust:
    - Volume of stance/defence drilling.
    - Time spent on deep-shot recovery vs early shot-stopping.
    - Degree to which you need to emphasise posture and guard-avoidance in aftermath.
