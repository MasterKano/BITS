# Entries – Legs to Upper Body

## 1. Purpose
- Systematise how leg attacks (your own and your opponent’s) feed into upper body grips.
- Turn every shot – successful, failed, or defended – into an opportunity for upper body control instead of a reset.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Your shot to upper body
- Initial chest-to-thigh contact with hands locked around legs.
- As opponent sprawls or stands:
  - Hands climb from legs → hips/waist → ribs/back.
  - Head rises to shoulder line.
  - Finish in over/under, body lock, or pinch headlock.

### Their shot to your upper body
- Sprawl or hip drop to deny penetration.
- Immediate use of:
  - Whizzer + wrist.
  - Lat + wrist.
  - Front headlock / chin strap.
- These grips then lead into:
  - Cow catcher.
  - Sumi/Ude Gaeshi.
  - Yoko Sumi, Ouchi, or front headlock follow-ups.

### High single / high double transitions
- When a leg is lifted high:
  - Shoulder pressure on their head.
  - Hands slide up the body.
  - Transition into body lock or front headlock.

## 3. Key Cues
- “Legs are just the gateway; finish at the torso.”
- “Never stay kneeling on a failed shot – climb up.”
- “Every defended shot is your entry to upper ties.”
- “Hands climb: legs → hips → ribs → chest/back.”
- “Turn towards the head on doubles, then climb to grips.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Shot-to-clinch chain
- Shooter:
  - Attacks single/double.
  - If stopped, must stand and convert to an upper body tie.
- Defender:
  - Provides realistic but controlled sprawl and hip pressure.
- Reset only once a clean upper body tie is established.

### Defended-shot conversion
- Partner shoots single or double.
- Defender:
  - Sprawls.
  - Immediately chooses one of:
    - Front headlock.
    - Whizzer + wrist into cow catcher/Sumi/Ude options.
    - Lat + wrist into Sumi/Ude.
- After establishing upper body control, either stabilise or throw.

### “No neutral after shots” game
- Rule set for standup rounds:
  - After any shot (yours or theirs), the sequence must end in:
    - A throw and 3-second control, or
    - A clear upper body tie you hold for a 2–3 count.
  - No pausing back in completely neutral stance.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Backing out after a failed shot and “starting fresh” instead of climbing to upper body.
- Sprawling and then disengaging instead of turning defence into attack.
- Hanging on the legs too long while the opponent posts and looks for chokes or counters.
