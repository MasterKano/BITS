# Sumi Gaeshi & Ude Gaeshi (Shot Counters)

## 1. Purpose
- Turn deep shots and body penetrations into sacrifice throws instead of pure sprawls.
- Give a reliable “older athlete” option that uses structure and timing more than speed.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Shared elements
- Opponent’s head and shoulders are driven into you under your centre of mass.
- You control:
  - Head or neck (chin strap/front HL).
  - An arm or lat line.
- One of your legs becomes a hook under or around their thigh/hip.

### Sumi Gaeshi
- Hook often placed between their legs or inside near thigh.
- You sit/fall backwards on a line, rolling them over your body.
- Ideal result:
  - You on top, often in mount or near-mount, or in strong passing position.

### Ude Gaeshi
- Similar sacrifice path but with heavier emphasis on arm control angle.
- Arm is “cut” or rotated across during the throw.
- Often yields strong pin with compromised shoulder line.

## 3. Key Cues
- “If they get deep, don’t only retreat – load them.”
- “Head and arm, then hook under the hip.”
- “Sit and roll through your shoulder, not straight down your spine.”
- “Throw them over your centre, not off to the side.”
- “Keep control through the landing – the throw is only halfway.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Static entry drills
- Start with partner on a controlled single/double, head high.
- Establish:
  - Head/neck control (front HL or strong collar control).
  - Arm or lat control.
  - Hook placement under thigh/hip.
- Run the Sumi/Ude path slowly, focusing on alignment and landing.

### Shot-to-sacrifice chain
- Partner shoots live but with moderate pace.
- Your task:
  - Decide early: sprawl-and-climb or Sumi/Ude.
  - If Sumi/Ude, commit to full throw and stabilise on top.

### Directional games
- Stand in front of partner.
- They alternate deep shots to each side.
- You must instantly choose:
  - Sumi/Ude to that side; or
  - Cow catcher/front HL follow ups.
- Emphasis on decision speed rather than maximal intensity.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Falling flat on the back instead of rolling through shoulder and side.
- Trying to sacrifice without establishing head-and-arm control.
- Leaving hooks too shallow so the opponent’s hips slide off instead of loading.
- Not following through to a strong top position, stopping mentally once they flip.
