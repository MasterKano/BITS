# Standing Positional Hierarchy (No-Gi Jiu-Jitsu)

## Purpose

- Provide a clear, repeatable map of the standing phase for no-gi jiu-jitsu so athletes always know “where they are” and where they should try to go next.
- Replace unstructured collar-tie brawling with a positional ladder that mirrors ground hierarchy logic: open neutral → advantage ties → top-tier standing positions → impact/aftermath → scoring.
- Give coaches and athletes a shared language for diagnosing stand-up problems, planning sessions and evaluating exchanges in sparring and competition.

## Key Positions

- Open Neutral
  - Both athletes in stance, roughly square, with no decisive grips or angles.
  - Hands and head in front of hips, but neither side has inside control or meaningful head-position advantage.
  - Baseline: safest but lowest-yield tier in the hierarchy.

- Advantage Ties
  - Face-to-face positions with a clear but not decisive advantage in grips or head position.
  - Typical examples:
    - 2-on-1 / Russian tie (wrist–elbow or full arm control).
    - Collar-and-bicep, collar-and-wrist with inside tie and better head position.
    - Underhook + wrist or underhook + collar.
    - Neutral front headlock with solid posture (not hanging).
  - Purpose: launch pad to move into back exposure, short offence or high-quality leg entries.

- Top-Tier Standing Positions
  - Standing Rear Body Lock:
    - Chest-to-back alignment, hands locked around waist or lower torso, head near shoulder line.
    - Opponent’s offence largely facing away; your takedown and back-take options expand.
  - Short Offence (chest-on-back, knee in):
    - Chest on upper back, attacker in front of opponent’s elbows, at least one knee between.
    - Arises from sprawls, snapdowns and front headlock spins; major breakdown and scoring hub.
  - Strong Front Headlock with Posts:
    - Head and arm controlled; your head and hips safe; opponent’s hands or knees posting.
    - A “corridor” position that feeds short offence, snaps and reshots rather than a final destination.
  - Dominant Leg-Control Shells:
    - Positions where you have strong control of one or both legs and posture (e.g. strong single / double shells) without sacrificing neck/back safety.
    - Used to feed reshots, body locks and finishes that land in favourable aftermath positions.

- Impact / Aftermath Positions (Entry into Ground Hierarchy)
  - Branch A – Opponent facing you:
    - They fall toward guard-facing shapes (open guard, half guard, seated).
    - You must immediately resolve leg pummels, hip coverage and head-over-head.
  - Branch B – Opponent turning away / turtle:
    - They go to hands and knees or partly turn to avoid clean top positions.
    - You attach to hips/back via hip rides, seatbelts, claws and mat returns.
  - Branch C – Opponent on side / seated:
    - They land on hip or seated with torso turned to side.
    - You clamp head and near hip and convert to strong half, side or back.

## Key Cues

- Hierarchy First, Techniques Second
  - “Which tier am I in right now: open neutral, advantage tie, top-tier standing, or aftermath?”
  - “Is my next move an upgrade in the hierarchy, a lateral move or a downgrade?”

- Open Neutral
  - “Leave neutral, don’t live there.”
  - Maintain stance (hips back, knees bent, head over lead knee) and head/hands in front of hips.
  - Use hand fighting to create inside ties and head-position wins, not to trade random slaps and posts.

- Advantage Ties
  - “Every tie must point somewhere.”
  - From any advantage tie, know your primary upgrade:
    - 2-on-1 → drag / throw-by to back.
    - Collar-and-bicep → snapdown or duck/drag to back.
    - Underhook + wrist → throw-by / snap to short offence or body lock.
  - If a tie does not have a clear path to back/short offence or high-quality shot, change the tie.

- Top-Tier Standing Positions
  - Rear body lock:
    - “Lock, walk, drop”:
      - Lock hands quickly.
      - Walk your lock down to hips.
      - Drop your level to sit into their stance while staying behind.
  - Short offence:
    - “Chest on back, knee in, hands in pits.”
    - As soon as they shoot or snap, move chest from head to upper back and insert knee between their thighs.
  - Strong front headlock:
    - “Head safe, hips safe, then headlock.”
    - Use it to move them to hands and knees or into short offence, not to hang from the neck.

- Impact / Aftermath
  - “The takedown isn’t finished at impact; it’s finished when aftermath is won.”
  - Immediate sequence after any takedown:
    - Legs: step over, pummel, or staple so you avoid neutral open guard.
    - Hips: put your hips over theirs, not behind or far away.
    - Head: keep your head at or above theirs, steering their chin and shoulder line.

## Drills & Games

- Map & Call Drill (Conceptual Orientation)
  - Partners lightly hand fight and move in stance.
  - Coach periodically calls a tier: “Neutral”, “Advantage”, “Top-tier”, “Aftermath A/B/C”.
  - Athletes must freeze and label where they currently are; if they cannot, they reset to neutral and start again.
  - Goal: build constant awareness of where you sit in the hierarchy.

- Tie Upgrade Chains
  - Start from open neutral.
  - Sequence:
    - Win advantage tie (e.g. 2-on-1).
    - Upgrade to top-tier standing (rear body lock or short offence).
    - Finish light takedown and hit a chosen aftermath branch.
  - Repeat on both sides; increase resistance gradually.

- Restricted Tier Sparring
  - Round 1: “No Neutral” – every exchange must leave neutral inside 3–5 seconds via a tie upgrade.
  - Round 2: “Top-Tier Only” – you may only attempt takedowns once you have rear body lock, short offence or strong front headlock.
  - Round 3: “Aftermath Only” – start rounds with one athlete mid-fall (impact already happening) and fight only for aftermath outcomes.

- Ladder Climb & Drop Game
  - Start both in open neutral.
  - Points:
    - +1 for reaching advantage ties.
    - +2 for reaching top-tier standing.
    - +3 for achieving clear aftermath control (3-second top or back exposure).
  - -2 if you voluntarily drop from a higher tier to a lower one without being forced (e.g. pulling guard from advantage ties with no clear attack).

## Common Mistakes

- Treating Neutral as the Default Game
  - Spending whole rounds in collar-tie slap-fights with no attempt to upgrade position.
  - Fix: impose time or touch limits in neutral before a mandatory upgrade attempt.

- Shooting from Raw Neutral
  - Firing long-range doubles/singles with no prior grip or head-position advantage.
  - Fix: require advantage ties or obviously compromised stance before any leg attack.

- Ignoring Back and Short Offence Opportunities
  - Seeing the back or gaining chest-on-back contact but failing to lock rear body lock or establish short offence.
  - Fix: drill “back-on-sight” habit – any glimpse of back triggers an automatic attempt to attach and lock.

- Treating Takedown Impact as the End
  - Relaxing after the opponent hits the mat, allowing guard recovery, stand-ups or reversals.
  - Fix: drill impact-start scenarios; only score exchanges based on aftermath positions, not on who completed the entry.

- Over-Focusing on Front Headlock
  - Hanging on the head from poor posture, hunting guillotines instead of using front headlock as a corridor to better positions.
  - Fix: enforce rule that any front headlock must be converted to short offence, back or clear aftermath branch within a few beats.

## Personal Notes

- Capture here how this hierarchy currently shows up in your rounds:
  - Which tier do you spend most time in (neutral, advantage ties, top-tier, aftermath)?
  - Which specific ties feel natural for you (2-on-1, collar-bicep, underhook + wrist, front headlock)?
  - Which top-tier standing position are you best at reaching: rear body lock or short offence?
- Define your current A-game ladder:
  - “From neutral I want to reach [advantage tie], then [top-tier position], then usually [aftermath branch] into [preferred ground system].”
- Revisit after each 12-session block:
  - Note which tiers you almost never touch (e.g. rarely hitting rear body lock).
  - Note which aftermath branches you routinely lose (e.g. always losing when they turtle – Branch B).
  - Use those observations to decide the next system page to refine (rear body lock, short offence, four-point breakdowns, stand-ups, etc.).
