# Short Offence (Chest-on-Back Standing Control)

## Purpose

- Establish short offence (chest-on-back with knee in) as a primary standing control shell for turning shot defence and snapdowns into scoring opportunities.
- Provide clear mechanics for entering, stabilising and progressing from short offence into go-behinds, breakdowns, mat returns and back takes in no-gi jiu-jitsu.
- Integrate short offence into the overall standing hierarchy so that sprawls and front headlocks consistently upgrade to chest-on-back dominance rather than resetting to neutral.

## Key Positions

- Core Short Offence Position

  - Your chest is on the opponent’s upper back (shoulder blades), not on the head or neck.
  - At least one of your knees is on the mat between or just outside their knees; the other leg can be posted or kneeling for balance.
  - Your body line is in front of their elbows: their arms and hands are framed in front of you, not wrapped around your legs.
  - Your head is roughly over or slightly to the side of their spine; your hips are behind your head (no “face-dive” posture).

- Double Pits Variant

  - Both arms threaded deep into the opponent’s armpits (“double pits”), hands resting on or near their upper back.
  - Elbows tight to your ribs, forearms acting as posts that prevent their upper body from rising.
  - Very stable position for controlling posture and killing explosive stand-ups but with limited direct choking threats.

- Spiral Ride Variant

  - One hand controlling near hip or waist, the other hand on far elbow/shoulder.
  - Your near-side knee between their knees; far leg posted for mobility.
  - Used to turn their shoulders and collapse posts to one side, often feeding breakdowns and go-behinds.

- Short Offence to Hip Ride / Seatbelt

  - Opponent’s hips start to rise or they try to stand; your chest stays on back while one arm slides to waist/seatbelt.
  - Often transitions directly into hip rides, mat returns and four-point breakdowns.
  - Treated as the bridge from short offence into classical “on-the-mat” top game (four-point, referee’s, back).

## Key Cues

- Acquisition Cues

  - From Sprawl:
    - “Chest off the head, onto the back.”
    - After sprawling, slide your chest up from the back of their head/neck to their upper back; do not hang over the neck.
    - Insert a knee between their thighs as soon as possible to block stand-ups and rolls.
  - From Snapdown:
    - “Hands to mat, then chest replaces hands.”
    - Walk them forward with snaps until palms touch the mat; once hands post, step your feet back and drop chest onto upper back, knee inside.
  - From Front Headlock:
    - “Headlock to short offence, not headlock forever.”
    - When they base on hands/knees, release pure neck hang and slide to chest-on-back with at least one arm entering the pits or hip ride.

- Structural Cues

  - “Chest on back, not over head.”
    - Your sternum should be between their shoulder blades, not on the back of their head.
  - “One knee in, one knee out.”
    - One knee between or tight beside their knees to control hips.
    - Other leg posted out for base and angle changes.
  - “Hands in pits before hands on neck.”
    - Prioritise double pits/spiral rides to control posture; submissions and front headlocks are secondary layers.

- Progression and Finish Cues

  - “Break them before you pass them or take their back.”
    - Use spiral and shoelace breakdowns to remove posts before chasing hooks or side control.
  - “If they try to stand, ride the hips.”
    - As they build to feet, follow with hip ride/seatbelt and mat returns rather than letting them stand into neutral.
  - “Spin behind when arms are long and posts weak.”
    - When their arms are extended and weight is forward, use knee slides and hip circles to take the back into standing rear body lock.

## Drills & Games

- Entry Drills (Low to Moderate Resistance)

  - Sprawl-to-Short-Offence Drill
    - B shoots controlled single/double.
    - A sprawls, then:
      - Slides chest from head to upper back.
      - Inserts near knee between B’s knees.
      - Establishes double pits or spiral ride.
    - Freeze and check:
      - Chest on back, body in front of elbows, one knee in, head not diving over.

  - Snapdown-to-Short-Offence Drill
    - From collar-and-wrist / collar-and-bicep:
      - A snaps B to hands.
      - When B’s hands post, A steps back and drops chest to upper back, knee in.
    - Progression:
      - Start static.
      - Add movement and stance.
      - Add light resistance to snaps and entries.

  - Front-Headlock-to-Short-Offence Conversion
    - Start in front headlock (head-and-arm).
    - A walks B to hands and knees, then:
      - Releases heavy neck hang.
      - Slides chest to back.
      - Inserts knee and transitions to double pits or spiral ride.

- Control and Transition Drills

  - Double Pits Retention Rounds
    - Start with A in short offence (double pits), B at 30–50% effort trying to:
      - Build up to stand.
      - Roll to guard/turtle.
    - A’s tasks:
      - Maintain chest-on-back and knee inside.
      - Adjust head and hips to follow.
      - When B posts hands high, drill go-behind to rear body lock.

  - Spiral Ride to Breakdown Series
    - Start in short offence with spiral configuration.
    - A uses spiral + knee pressure to:
      - Collapse near post.
      - Turn B’s shoulders to one side.
      - Break B to a hip (four-point breakdown).
    - Repeat to both sides.

- Positional Sparring Games

  - Short-Offence Only Top
    - Start: A in short offence, B on hands and knees.
    - A may only score by:
      - Go-behind to rear body lock, or
      - Breakdown to four-point and then hooks or 3-second top.
    - B scores by:
      - Standing safely.
      - Recovering guard without conceding hooks/3-second control.

  - “Sprawl Must Become Short Offence”
    - B shoots light/mid-level.
    - A must:
      - Sprawl.
      - Convert to short offence within 3 seconds.
    - If A only sprawls and resets without short offence, reset and give point to B (for “escaping” the system).

## Common Mistakes

- Hanging on the Head Instead of Taking the Back

  - Symptom:
    - A sprawls or snaps but keeps chest over the head, pulling on neck rather than sliding to back.
  - Consequences:
    - Fatigue in arms and neck, limited control, easy guillotine/kimura trading.
  - Fix:
    - Enforce cue: “Head first, then back.”
    - Drill chest slides from head to back as a discrete skill.

- No Knee Inside (Floating Over Turtle)

  - Symptom:
    - A hovers chest over back with both knees off-line; B easily stands or rolls through.
  - Consequences:
    - Weak hip control; poor leverage for breakdowns and mat returns.
  - Fix:
    - Make “one knee in” non-negotiable in technical and positional work.
    - Check knee position at the end of every entry rep.

- Chasing Submissions Too Early

  - Symptom:
    - A immediately grabs guillotines or front chokes from half-built short offence, often sliding off and losing position.
  - Consequences:
    - Lost back exposure opportunities; giving up scrambles.
  - Fix:
    - Impose rule: no submissions from short offence until:
      - Chest is firmly on back.
      - Knee is inside.
      - B’s posture is clearly broken.
    - Emphasise breakdown → position → submission order.

- Failing to Use Short Offence as a Hub

  - Symptom:
    - A treats short offence as a brief stop then resets to neutral, rather than a hub to back, breakdowns and mat returns.
  - Consequences:
    - Wasted defensive wins; low conversion to scoring positions.
  - Fix:
    - In positional games, require A to either:
      - Take back (rear body lock / hooks), or
      - Establish 3-second top from breakdowns.
    - No credit for simply “holding” short offence without progression.

- Over-Committing Weight Forward

  - Symptom:
    - A leans far over B’s back with hips too high; B can sit through, grab legs or roll.
  - Consequences:
    - Lost balance, leg entanglements, reversals.
  - Fix:
    - Cue: “Hips behind head, not above head.”
    - Ensure your hips are not stacked over your head and maintain a slight angle, not full parallel alignment.

## Personal Notes

- Document your main short-offence entries:
  - From defence:
    - e.g. “Sprawl vs double → slide to short offence (left knee in).”
  - From ties:
    - e.g. “Collar-and-bicep snap → short offence (right knee in).”
  - From front headlock:
    - e.g. “Front headlock off shot → chest-on-back, double pits.”

- Define your short-offence progression preferences:
  - “When they stay low and static, I prefer __________ breakdown.”
  - “When they try to stand, I prefer __________ mat return.”
  - “When they reach far with arms, I prefer __________ go-behind to rear body lock.”

- After each 12-session block, note:
  - How often you successfully convert sprawls into short offence in live rounds.
  - Which escapes from training partners you struggle most to contain (stand-up, guard roll, peek-outs).
  - Which short-offence sequences convert most consistently to back exposure or 3-second top; mark those as candidates for promotion into your A-game chains and into the unified `SYS/standup/` library.
