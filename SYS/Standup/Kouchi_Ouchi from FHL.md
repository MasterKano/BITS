# Kouchi/Ouchi from Front Headlock

## 1. Purpose
- Turn front headlock into a tight, low-impact finishing system using small trips rather than big amplitude throws.
- Provide clean, repeatable finishes for older or less explosive athletes once front HL is secured.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Front HL base
- Chin strap:
  - Forearm under jaw/neck, palm cupping chin.
- Shoulder:
  - On top of upper spine/back of neck.
- Secondary control:
  - Near triceps, elbow, or lat – arm cannot freely post.

### Foot and hip relationship
- Your hips close enough that you can feel their hip line.
- Your head and chest slightly off to one side, not directly square in front.
- Your legs staggered:
  - One leg free to trip inside (Kouchi) or outside (Ouchi).

## 3. Key Cues
- “Head down, arm blocked, then trip.”
- “Front HL gives posture; trips give the finish.”
- “Load their weight onto the target leg before you reap.”
- “Kouchi – small inside knife; Ouchi – big inside reap.”
- “Stay tight with chest over their upper back; don’t lean away.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Static Kouchi from HL
- From stable front HL (standing):
  - Use chin strap and shoulder pressure to bend them.
  - As they step forward to regain base:
    - Guide their weight onto that leg.
    - Use inside of your foot to sweep/reap behind their heel (Kouchi).
  - Follow to top, securing chest-to-chest or chest-to-back.

### Static Ouchi from HL
- From slightly more upright HL:
  - Step deeper between their legs.
  - Reap their inner thigh/calf from behind (Ouchi).
  - Drive with chest and shoulder to take them straight back.

### HL trip chaining drill
- Start in front HL.
- Partner:
  - Tries to recover posture by stepping and turning.
- You:
  - Alternate Kouchi and Ouchi depending on where they step.
  - Always aim to land in a clear scoring position.

### HL-based finishing game
- Rule set:
  - You start in front HL.
  - You may only finish using trips (Kouchi/Ouchi) and follow-ups to pins/back.
  - No sacrifice throws in this game – focus on footwork and posture control.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Trying to trip from too far away with no hip contact.
- Reaping without first loading their weight onto the target leg.
- Bending your own spine heavily forward, losing ability to adjust or defend.
- Letting go of HL during the trip and giving them a chance to roll or scramble.
