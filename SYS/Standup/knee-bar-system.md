# System: Knee Bar (Lat / Heel-Knee-Bar Structures)

## 1. Purpose
Knee bars are treated as a **straight-line breaking family** that becomes high-percentage when:
- the defender’s rotation is constrained,
- the knee line and hip line are controlled,
- and the structure prevents free spinning.

In this instructional context, knee bars are often reached via dilemmas:
- Toe Hold ↔ Knee Bar
- Heel pressure ↔ extension reactions
- Two-leg control structures (Double Trouble / lace) that remove spin.

## 2. When to Use It
Use knee bars when:
- the defender extends the leg to defend toe hold or heel attacks,
- you have strong two-leg control and can align hips to the knee,
- heel exposure is difficult but the leg is straight-line available,
- ruleset makes heel hooks undesirable/illegal.

Avoid low-control knee bars where:
- only the foot is controlled and the rest of the chain is free to spin.

## 3. Core Structural Requirements
1) **Hip line alignment**
   - Your hips must align with the defender’s knee joint for real extension power.
2) **Rotation constraint**
   - A knee bar without spin control is often an escape race.
3) **Knee line awareness**
   - Even in knee bars, knee line and leg isolation remain essential.

## 4. Primary Structures
### 4.1 Lat Knee Bar (high-control preference)
- The defender’s leg is draped and wedged so friction + alignment constrain rotation.
- Often higher-percentage because it reduces “free spin” escapes.

### 4.2 Heel-Knee-Bar Hybrid
- Uses heel control mechanics to limit rotation while applying knee-bar hip extension.
- Valuable when the defender’s primary escape is spinning out.

## 5. Primary Dilemmas
### 5.1 Toe Hold ↔ Knee Bar
- Toe hold forces extension/turning.
- That reaction often presents the knee bar if your hips are aligned.

### 5.2 Heel Threat ↔ Knee Extension
- Defensive attempts to clear heel line frequently straighten the leg.
- If you can trap rotation, knee bar becomes available.

## 6. Entry Contexts
- From Double Trouble / two-leg control
- From Top Ushiro after toe-hold reaction
- From 50/50 / mutual when defender extends to escape toe hold/separation games
- From Cross/Inside transitions when heel hook path is denied but leg extends

## 7. Defensive Responsibilities
- Knee bars can still injure quickly; apply progressively in training.
- Do not accept a spinning escape that turns into a pass/back take—if spin begins and you cannot constrain it, transition rather than force.

## 8. Transition Map
- Knee Bar attempt → Heel control (to re-constrain spin)
- Knee Bar → Backside/Far-Hip (if rotation carries you into safer asymmetry)
- Knee Bar → Top dominance (if defender over-rotates and gives position)
- Knee Bar → Reset (if alignment is lost)

## 9. Drilling Progressions
### 9.1 Technical
- Hip alignment reps: “find the knee line, align hips, freeze.”
- Toe hold reaction → knee bar entry (scripted).

### 9.2 Progressive resistance
Defender:
1) tries to spin,
2) tries to retract leg,
3) tries to stand.
Attacker:
- must constrain rotation and finish or transition immediately.

### 9.3 Positional rounds
Start in a knee-bar-ready structure with controlled intensity.
Attacker wins by:
- controlled finish or safe conversion.
Defender wins by:
- clean spin-out + disengage without giving dominant position.

## 10. Common Failure Patterns
- “One-leg-only knee bar” with no rotation control
  - Fix: add two-leg constraint or heel control.
- “Hips misaligned”
  - Fix: alignment first; do not extend from a bad line.
- “Getting passed while chasing extension”
  - Fix: transition or reset when base is compromised.
