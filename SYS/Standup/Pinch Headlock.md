# Pinch Headlock

## 1. Purpose
- Use pinch headlock as a powerful but controlled head-and-arm tie from which to generate throws, trips, and transitions to the back.
- Provide a structured alternative to loose headlocks that often give up the back.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Base pinch HL
- One arm around the neck, one around the near arm, compressing them together (head-and-arm).
- Hands connect (gable, S-grip, or palm-to-wrist), squeezing the head and arm as a unit.
- Your ribs and chest clamp the trapped arm against their torso.

### Body alignment
- Hips close to theirs, no big gap.
- Head positioned so you can see past the far side of their body.
- Spine relatively straight; avoid bent-over “football” headlock posture.

### Lower body
- Feet in a stance that allows:
  - Inside and outside trips.
  - Rotational throws.
  - Sacrifice options when they drive in.

## 3. Key Cues
- “Head and arm together – never isolate the head alone.”
- “Clamp with your ribs as much as with your arms.”
- “Your hip must touch before you throw; no long-distance headlocks.”
- “Turn your chest to face the direction of the throw.”
- “From pinch headlock: throw, trip, or take the back – don’t hang out.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Entry and clamp drill
- From pummelling and over/under:
  - Practise slipping to head-and-arm.
  - Close grip and clamp arm to ribs.
  - Stabilise for a 2–3 second count.

### Trip menu
- From stable pinch HL:
  - Practise inside trip.
  - Practise outside trip.
  - Practise simple turn-down to back exposure when they spin.
- Emphasise controlled falls, side landings, and immediate chest control.

### Headlock positional rounds
- Start in pinch HL.
- Attacker:
  - Can win via pin, back exposure, or controlled submission transitions.
- Defender:
  - Can win by:
    - Turning and escaping.
    - Getting behind the attacker safely.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Using a “schoolyard headlock” with no arm trapped, exposing your own back.
- Standing too far away, relying only on arm strength.
- Throwing with no hip connection, leading to big slips or getting reversed.
- Ignoring the back-take opportunities when the opponent turns to escape.
