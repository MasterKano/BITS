# Double Unders & Body Lock

## 1. Purpose
- Make double underhooks and body lock a high-value, high-control tie that reliably leads to takedowns and pins.
- Provide a structured way for smaller/older athletes to dominate clinch without relying on explosiveness.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Double underhooks
- Both arms inside, elbows tight to ribs.
- Hands connected behind opponent’s waist, hips, or lower ribs.
- Head high, positioned under their jawline or against chest.

### Body lock variants
- Low body lock (around hips).
- Mid body lock (around lower ribs).
- High body lock (around upper ribs/shoulder line).

### Hip relationship
- Your hips close enough that you can bump or lift.
- Feet staggered to allow level changes and directional steps.

## 3. Key Cues
- “Hands low to lift the hips; hands high to disturb posture.”
- “Elbows glued to ribs, not floating.”
- “Lift with legs and hips, not lower back.”
- “Use your steps to turn corners, not just straight drives.”
- “Double unders are not neutral; they’re a finishing tie.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Double-under acquisition from pummelling
- Standard pummelling.
- Task: close elbows and sneak inside for second underhook.
- Once achieved, hold double unders for 2–3 seconds, then release and restart.

### Body lock step-and-bump
- From double unders:
  - Move through:
    - Lifts (off-balances).
    - Side bumps.
    - Direction changes.
  - No throw yet; just making partner walk and lose balance.

### Finish menu drill
- From strong body lock, cycle through:
  - Simple knee-pick/inside trip style takedown.
  - Lift and twist to side, landing chest-to-chest.
  - Back-taking option when they turn away.
- Always finish with a 3-second chest-to-chest or chest-to-back control.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Getting double unders and then freezing, treating it as “just a good position”.
- Letting elbows flare, making it easy for them to pummel back inside.
- Bending at the waist to lift instead of driving with legs and hips.
- Driving straight forward only, never turning corners when they resist.
