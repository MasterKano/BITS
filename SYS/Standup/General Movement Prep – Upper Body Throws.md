# General Movement Prep – Upper Body Throws

## 1. Purpose
- Define the minimum movement capacity required to safely and effectively perform the throwing systems in this instructional.
- Provide a small, repeatable warm-up sequence that directly supports the throws (rather than generic conditioning).

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Forward flexibility base
- Knees locked, back flexed, hands touching (or close to) the floor.
- Tells you if you can safely hinge and fold into sacrifice and hip-throw positions.

### Back-step pattern
- Classic “one, two, three” step:
  - Step in.
  - Step back.
  - Step across.
- Mirrors Tai Otoshi and many hip throw turning patterns.

### Inside-step pattern
- Foot “stabs” inside the opponent’s stance.
- Torso turns and gaze rotates in the throw direction.
- Body weight shifts over the stepping foot.

### One-leg balance hinge
- Standing on one leg while opposite hand touches the floor.
- Trains balance for Ken Ken Uchi Mata, lateral drops, and hip turns.

### Side-fall posture
- Falling onto your side with shoulder-hip alignment (not flat back).
- Protects ribs and shoulders during sacrifice entries.

## 3. Key Cues
- “These are minimum requirements, not gymnastic tricks.”
- “Step in, step back, step across.”
- “Step inside, look where you want them to land.”
- “Fall on your side, not your spine.”
- “If you can’t control one-leg balance, smooth sacrifice entries will be hard.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Solo prep sequence (3–5 minutes)
- 1 minute: locked-knee toe touches, relaxed bouncing in and out of end range.
- 1–2 minutes: shadow back-step footwork, focusing on smooth, rhythmic turns.
- 1–2 minutes: inside-step with torso/gaze rotation, imagining a partner.

### Balance and fall practice
- One-leg stand with opposite hand-to-floor touch; return to stance without hopping.
- Static side-fall practice:
  - Sit/fall to side, shoulder and hip taking the contact, knees slightly bent.
  - Recover back to standing with simple technical stand-ups.

### Assisted entry drill
- Partner supports upper body in clinch.
- You practise:
  - Stepping in / stepping across.
  - Falling to side under control.
  - Returning to stance.
- No full throws; just entries and landings.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Skipping movement prep and going straight to high-amplitude throws.
- Over-rotating into back landings rather than controlled side-falls.
- Trying to hop-drive throws (Ken Ken, Uchi Mata variants) without basic one-leg balance.
