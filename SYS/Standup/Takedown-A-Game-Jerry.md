# SYSTEM – Takedown A-Game – Jerry

## 1. Purpose
- Define Jerry’s personal standup A-game, aligned with robust but older athlete profile and preferences.
- Provide a simple, repeatable decision tree that connects the main systems into a coherent plan.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Primary starting intentions
- Stand in solid stance, ready to:
  - Hand fight to upper ties.
  - Defend shots structurally (whizzer/lat/HL), not by outrunning.

### Core hubs for Jerry
- Front headlock:
  - From sprawls, snaps, and misdirected shots.
- Over/under clinch:
  - From pummelling and grip fighting.
- Strong overhook & whizzer:
  - Especially versus single-leg attempts and underhook hunters.

### Preferred finishing families
- From front HL:
  - Cow catcher.
  - Yoko Sumi.
  - Kouchi/Ouchi trip finishes.
- From over/under/overhook:
  - Uki Waza.
  - Inside/outside trips (Ouchi/Kosoto/Kouchi) when posture is broken.
- From shots (yours or theirs):
  - Sumi/Ude Gaeshi when they come in deep and heavy.
  - Climbing from shots to upper ties instead of forcing every leg finish.

## 3. Key Cues
- “Use structure, not speed – make them push into your frames.”
- “Every shot they take is a potential throw for you.”
- “Prefer head-and-arm and overhook-based systems when in doubt.”
- “If front HL appears, prioritise cow catcher / Yoko Sumi over big hip throws.”
- “Trips and sacrifice throws first; high-amplitude hip throws are optional extras.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### A-game flow rounds
- Rounds where you are explicitly trying to:
  - Draw shots and counter with front HL → cow catcher/Yoko/Sumi.
  - Win over/under from hand fighting → Uki Waza / trips.
- Sam’s role:
  - Give realistic but appropriate intensity.
  - Feed representative reactions while protecting your joints/neck.

### A-game decision-tree rehearsals
- Starting from neutral:
  - Run multiple “if–then” chains at low intensity:
    - If they shoot → sprawl + HL → cow catcher.
    - If no HL but strong whizzer → Sumi/Ude or climb to HL.
    - If over/under → Uki Waza or trips.
  - Focus on recognition and sequencing, not speed.

### “Jerry wins only with his A-game” rounds
- Constraint:
  - You only score if you use an A-game pathway (no random throws).
- This cements which branches you truly trust.

## 5. Common Mistakes (for Jerry)
- Getting tempted into “young man” hip throws when a safe cow catcher or trip is available.
- Staying in loose headlocks instead of tight head-and-arm structures.
- Failing to climb from defended shots to upper ties, giving neutral resets instead of control.
- Under-using trips, especially when Sam’s stance is already compromised.
