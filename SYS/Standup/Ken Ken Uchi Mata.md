# Ken Ken Uchi Mata

## 1. Purpose
- Turn body lock/over–under ties into a reliable inside-reaping throw that does not rely on big explosive hip rotation.
- Give a “hopping” version of Uchi Mata that suits older or less explosive athletes while remaining high-percentage in clinch.

## 2. Key Positions / Structures
### Starting ties
- Over/under:
  - Strong underhook on throwing side.
  - Overhook or clamp on opposite side.
  - Hips close – no arm’s-length gap.
- Double unders / body lock:
  - Both arms inside, elbows tight, hands connected around hips/waist.
  - Head close to their chest/shoulder line.

### Body alignment before entry
- Your inside (throwing-side) leg is between their legs, knee slightly bent.
- Your hips are slightly outside and ahead of theirs, ready to turn.
- Upper body:
  - Underhook/lock lifting and rotating their trunk.
  - Head looking in the direction you intend to throw, not down.

### Reaping leg & “Ken Ken” action
- Throwing leg (inside leg):
  - Initially inserted between their legs, thigh in contact with their inner thigh.
  - As you turn, your reaping leg lifts and reaps their inner thigh upward and slightly backward.
- “Ken Ken” (hopping) foot:
  - Your non-throwing leg hops on the mat to:
    - Maintain balance.
    - Adjust angle.
    - Chase their base as they resist.

## 3. Key Cues
- “Close the hip gap, then insert the inside leg.”
- “Lift with your underhook/body lock as your thigh lifts theirs.”
- “Hop to follow, don’t try to finish in a single huge swing.”
- “Turn your eyes and chest in the throwing direction.”
- “End with their weight off their heel, not just nudged sideways.”

## 4. Drills & Games
### Entry pattern drill
- From over/under or body lock:
  - Step your inside leg between theirs, thigh lightly touching.
  - Turn your hips and shoulders to align for Uchi Mata.
  - Lift slightly with upper body and thigh, then reset.
- Focus:
  - Clean hip–leg–upper body alignment.
  - No wild swinging or over-rotation.

### Ken Ken balance and chase drill
- From a static clinch:
  - Insert inside leg and begin small reaps.
  - Use non-throwing leg to “Ken Ken” hop around them.
  - Goal: keep their weight on one leg and off-balance without finishing.
- Emphasise:
  - Controlled hops.
  - Constant upper-body lift and rotation.

### Controlled finish drill
- From body lock/over–under:
  - Enter Ken Ken Uchi Mata and complete the throw.
  - Land with:
    - Your chest facing them.
    - Knees bent.
    - Immediate move to chest-to-chest or chest-to-back control.
- Start at 30–40% power, then build.

### Ken Ken vs base game
- Partner’s job:
  - Maintain base by stepping, posting, and turning.
- Your job:
  - Continuously adjust with hops and reaps to break their base and finish them to the mat.
- Limit rounds to 30–45 seconds for quality.

## 5. Common Mistakes
- Entering from too far away – no hip contact, reaping leg just swings in space.
- Trying to “big throw” with one huge lift instead of small, controlled hops.
- Dropping head and bending at the waist, losing ability to lift their trunk.
- Neglecting the non-throwing leg – no Ken Ken footwork, just static balance.
- Finishing with them on all fours while you are off-balance, instead of guiding them into a side/back landing you can control.
