# Scrimmage Wrestling & Aftermath Control

## Purpose

- Define the “scrimmage phase” that begins once a takedown is attempted and someone’s base breaks, and ends when scoring or clear escape is achieved.
- Provide a structured map for the aftermath of takedowns: who really wins once someone hits the mat (points, back exposure, escapes).
- Give athletes repeatable behaviours from key aftermath branches (facing you, turning away/turtle, on side/seated) so they stop winning entries but losing scores.

## Key Positions

- Four-Point / Referee’s (Bottom)

  - Athlete on hands and knees (or variants with one knee up).
  - Hips roughly in line with or slightly above knees.
  - For top: primary breakdown hub for back-takes and mat returns.
  - For bottom: launch pad for stand-ups and Granby/sit-out escapes.

- Four-Point / Referee’s (Top)

  - Chest over upper back or shoulder line, not directly over hips.
  - One or both knees on the mat, often straddling or just behind opponent’s hips.
  - Control shells:
    - Spiral ride (hip + far shoulder/elbow).
    - Shoelace / ankle control.
    - Seatbelt / claw ride.
  - From here: breakdowns to hips/side, mat returns, hook insertion.

- Hip Ride / Seatbelt on Turtle

  - Opponent turtled or in compact referee’s; your chest on back, hips behind theirs.
  - One arm around waist or across chest (seatbelt), the other posting or controlling near arm.
  - Used to:
    - Prevent full stand-up.
    - Rotate them to hip/side.
    - Insert hooks or transition to strong top (side/half).

- Seated / On-Side Scramble

  - Opponent on a hip or seated with torso partially turned (not fully flat, not on knees).
  - For top:
    - One arm on head/neck or upper back.
    - One arm controlling near hip or far post.
    - Hips close enough to clamp and drive, not hanging back.
  - For bottom:
    - Guard-building or stand-up options depending on angle and distance.

- Impact Branches (Outcome Categories)

  - Branch A – Facing You:
    - Opponent falls toward guard-facing shapes (open guard, half guard, seated guard).
  - Branch B – Turning Away / Turtle:
    - Opponent turns away, drops to knees or turtled to avoid clean top positions.
  - Branch C – On Side / Seated:
    - Opponent lands on hip/side with option to turn in (guard) or away (turtle).

## Key Cues

- Global

  - “The takedown is not finished at impact; it is finished when aftermath is won.”
  - Immediately identify which branch you are in (A/B/C) and run the appropriate script:
    - A: legs first, then hips, then head.
    - B: hips first (ride/seatbelt), then breakdown, then hooks/top.
    - C: clamp head + hip, then decide guard vs back.

- Branch A – Opponent Facing You

  - Top cues:
    - “Legs, hips, head – in that order.”
      - Leg pummel or step-over to avoid neutral open guard.
      - Put at least one hip above theirs; your belt over their belt.
      - Keep head above theirs, steering chin/shoulder away from strong guard frames.
    - “No lounging in double-guard.”
      - Do not sit back into symmetrical entanglements; either stand to headquarters or step-over to strong half/side.
  - Bottom cues:
    - “Frame, angle, then guard or stand.”
      - First: frames at hips/shoulders, not grips for submissions.
      - Then: angle hips away from pressure.
      - Then: either build guard or stand; do not stay square on your back.

- Branch B – Opponent Turning Away / Turtle

  - Top cues:
    - “Attach to hips before you chase hooks.”
      - Hip ride or seatbelt first, then breakdowns and hooks.
    - “Break them before you back-take them.”
      - Use spiral/shoelace/gut-wrench style actions to remove posts and collapse them to a hip or into 4-point.
  - Bottom cues:
    - “Turtle is a pit-stop, not a parking spot.”
      - Use four-point stand-ups and sit-outs; do not remain static.
      - Elbows tight, hands short; no long posts that can be spiral-ridden.

- Branch C – Opponent On Side / Seated

  - Top cues:
    - “Clamp the head and near hip.”
      - One arm controlling head/neck/shoulder, one controlling near hip or thigh.
      - Deny both full turn-in and full turn-away.
    - “Choose: strong half/side or back.”
      - If they turn in: slide into strong half/side.
      - If they turn away: chase hip ride/back takes.
  - Bottom cues:
    - “Decide early: guard or stand.”
      - Use seated guard frames to either:
        - Build robust guard (knee/shin shields, inside ties), or
        - Create space for technical stand-up.
      - Avoid half-committed attempts that give easy passes and mat returns.

## Drills & Games

- Impact-Start Branch Drills

  - Branch A (Facing You)
    - Start: B on back/hip, legs between; A kneeling or standing over.
    - A’s goal:
      - Immediate leg pummel/step-over → hip coverage → head control → 3s top.
    - B’s goal:
      - Deny 3s control; either re-guard to safe structure or stand.
    - Rotate roles and sides.

  - Branch B (Turning Away / Turtle)
    - Start: B on hands and knees; A in hip ride or short offence.
    - A’s goal:
      - Apply spiral/shoelace breakdowns to put B on hip/side and:
        - Insert hooks, or
        - Stabilise in strong top (side/half) for count.
    - B’s goal:
      - Four-point stand-ups, sit-outs, Granby/switch to avoid hooks and 3s control.

  - Branch C (On Side / Seated)
    - Start: B seated or on hip; A has one hand on head/neck, one on near hip.
    - A’s goal:
      - Clamp head + hip → pick side:
        - Collapse to strong half/side, or
        - Slide to back exposure.
    - B’s goal:
      - Build seated guard with frames and angle, or stand without conceding back/top.

- Four-Point / Referee’s Breakdown Series (Top)

  - Spiral Breakdown Chain
    - From spiral ride:
      - Turn shoulders with far arm while driving near hip.
      - Collapse near elbow/post.
      - Finish with opponent on hip/side; transition to side/back.
  - Shoelace & Ankle Breakdown:
    - Trap near ankle with instep.
    - Drive hips forward; pull ankle in; peel hands from mat.
    - Use collapse to flow into hooks or side control.

- Stand-Up & Escape Series (Bottom)

  - Four-Point Stand-Up Drill
    - Start: B at four-point, A with moderate top pressure.
    - B’s sequence:
      - Elbows tight, inside hands.
      - Knee under chest, head up.
      - Base foot, post hand, technical stand to stance.
    - A’s role:
      - Realistic but controlled ride; attempts mat returns but allows B to finish stand-up under good structure.

  - Granby / Sit-Out Chain
    - From heavy hip/waist control:
      - B practises Granby rolls and sit-outs to recover neutral or underhook.
    - Emphasise: re-facing at the end, not rolling blindly away.

- Scrimmage Rounds

  - “Takedown Event Ignored” Rounds
    - Start standing; allow normal entries.
    - Scoring and feedback only consider aftermath:
      - Who achieved 3-second top or back?
      - Who escaped or denied both?
    - Coach ignores “nice doubles”; only aftermath outcomes count.

  - “Mat Return vs Stand-Up” Rounds
    - Start from mid-stand (B on one knee/one foot, A attached to hips).
    - A’s goal: mat return → breakdown → hooks/3s top.
    - B’s goal: complete stand with safe stance or guard pull on their terms.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating Impact as the Finish Line

  - Symptom:
    - Relaxing after takedown; opponent immediately stands, re-guards or reverses.
  - Fix:
    - Always trigger “branch identification” at impact.
    - Drill impact-start scenarios until the first 3–5 seconds become automatic.

- Chasing Submissions Before Control

  - Symptom:
    - Jumping on guillotines/leg locks in chaotic aftermath before establishing basic head/hip dominance.
  - Fix:
    - Enforce rule in training: no submissions in aftermath until:
      - Legs are handled (no clean entanglement against you).
      - Head and hips are structurally winning.

- Ignoring Turtle / Four-Point as Scoring Hubs

  - Symptom:
    - Accepting turtle as “they escaped,” backing away or lazily hanging over back.
  - Fix:
    - Treat turtle/four-point as premium scoring positions:
      - Use breakdowns and mat returns as the main weapons.
      - Only disengage intentionally; no passive resets.

- Static Turtle or Four-Point from Bottom

  - Symptom:
    - Bottom player staying frozen in turtle/four-point waiting to be broken down.
  - Fix:
    - Make stand-ups mandatory goals in positional rounds:
      - Bottom can only “win” via stand-up or structured guard, not by stalling.

- Failing to Recognise Losing Branches

  - Symptom:
    - Athlete repeatedly loses the same aftermath scenario (e.g. every time opponent turtles, they escape; every time branch A happens, you fall into guard).
  - Fix:
    - After sparring, label exchanges by branch:
      - “I keep losing Branch B (turtle).”
    - Target that branch with focused drills and positional rounds.

## Personal Notes

- Note your typical aftermath patterns:
  - When you take people down, which branch do you see most often (A/B/C)?
  - When opponents take you down, which branch do you most often fall into?

- Identify your strengths and weaknesses:
  - “I usually win when they turtle, but I lose when they land facing me.”
  - “I almost never convert seated/side scrambles to strong top.”

- Set one branch focus per block:
  - Example:
    - Block 1: Fix Branch A (facing-you aftermath – leg pummels and hip coverage).
    - Block 2: Fix Branch B (turtle/four-point breakdowns and mat returns).
    - Block 3: Fix Branch C (seated/side clamps and conversions to strong half/back).

- Log specific problems from live rounds:
  - Opponents you cannot hold down (what branch, what exact escape?).
  - Takedowns where you always “almost score” but lose aftermath.
  - Use these notes to choose your next specialised standup system page (e.g. four-point breakdowns, stand-ups, leg pummels) to refine.
