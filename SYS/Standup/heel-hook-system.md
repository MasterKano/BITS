# System: Heel Hook (Inside vs Outside Mechanics + Priorities)

## 1. Purpose
Heel hooks are treated as the **highest-leverage rotational submission family** in the system, with clear prioritisation:
- **Inside heel hooks** are generally preferred for mechanical strength and tolerance of minor errors.
- **Outside heel hooks** remain essential, especially from Outside Ashi and many standing/transition contexts, but demand tighter positional detail.

This system frames heel hooks as the endpoint of a larger positional process:
- win knee line,
- establish wedges and hip control,
- expose heel,
- apply controlled rotational mechanics.

## 2. When to Use It
Use heel hooks when:
- ruleset permits,
- heel exposure is clean and you have knee-line control,
- you can deny the defender’s primary rotation escape routes.

Do not use heel hooks as:
- “panic attacks” from collapsing positions,
- or in symmetric positions where your own heel is not protected.

## 3. Core Structural Requirements
1) **Knee line ownership**
   - Non-negotiable for catastrophic rotational breaking.
2) **Hip control and wedges**
   - Your legs should prevent their hips from freely turning.
3) **Heel exposure is real**
   - Do not confuse “touching the heel” with controlling the heel line.
4) **Your heel safety (in symmetry)**
   - In 50/50/mutual, heel safety precedes offence.

## 4. Mechanics: Shared Principles
- Heel hooks are coupled-force rotational submissions:
  - your torso/hips generate rotation,
  - arms/forearm act as the controlling wedge around the heel,
  - legs prevent the knee and hip from turning out of danger.

Key cue:
- if you feel like you must “crank with arms,” your structure is not doing its job.

## 5. Inside vs Outside: Strategic Roles
### 5.1 Inside heel hook (preferred when available)
- Typically higher finishing leverage and more forgiving alignment.
- Often appears from:
  - Cross/Inside Ashi,
  - Backside 50/50,
  - certain Far-Hip transitions.

### 5.2 Outside heel hook (essential competence)
- Common from:
  - Outside Ashi,
  - Mutual Ashi exchanges (when you are structurally safe),
  - standing/transition scenarios.
- Requires more disciplined hip pinning to stop the defender from rotating out.

## 6. Exposure and Entry Logic (System View)
Heel hooks should be reached through a procedure:
1) establish Ashi hub (Irimi/Outside/Cross/Inside/Backside/Far-Hip),
2) stress-test control (can they back out, stand, roll, pummel?),
3) use tether/dilemma to force reaction (Achilles/toe hold when appropriate),
4) expose heel line,
5) finish only when rotation is constrained.

## 7. Dilemmas and Chains
### 7.1 Achilles ↔ Heel Hook
- Achilles tethers and forces turns/rolls that expose heel.

### 7.2 Toe Hold ↔ Heel Hook
- Toe hold forces rotation/unlocking that reveals heel line.

### 7.3 Heel Hook ↔ Follow-the-roll
- If defender rolls, you follow and land in:
  - Backside 50/50,
  - Far-Hip,
  - or a re-established Outside/Cross hub.

## 8. Defensive Responsibilities
- Apply progressively in training; rotational breaks are high risk.
- In symmetric positions:
  - protect your own heel first (“attack until you’re defending” logic still assumes heel safety is addressed).
- If knee line is slipping, abandon the finish and recapture or exit.

## 9. Transition Map
- Heel hook attempt → Backside 50/50 (common roll-follow endpoint)
- Heel hook attempt → Far-Hip (safety + continued offence)
- Heel hook attempt → Toe hold / Achilles (when heel slips but leg control remains)
- Heel hook attempt → Sweep/top/back (if defender over-rotates)

## 10. Drilling Progressions
### 10.1 Technical
- Heel exposure reps from each hub (Outside/Cross/Backside/Far-Hip).
- “Stress test first” reps: exposure only after control check.

### 10.2 Progressive resistance
Defender cycles:
1) roll,
2) spin/turn,
3) back-out,
4) pummel into symmetry.
Attacker:
- must maintain knee line and land in a planned hub after each defence.

### 10.3 Positional rounds
- Start in a hub with heel exposure available.
- Goal: controlled finish or controlled dominant transition; no reckless cranking.

## 11. Common Failure Patterns
- “Chasing heel without wedges”
  - Fix: re-wedge hips/knee line; heel comes after.
- “Losing knee line mid-finish”
  - Fix: stop and recapture; do not pull harder.
- “Attacking first in symmetry with exposed heel”
  - Fix: heel safety first; then offence.
