SYSTEM – Yoko Sumi Gaeshi

1. Purpose
- Provide a side-direction sacrifice throw from front headlock or strong overhook ties.
- Give a lower-impact alternative to big forward hip throws that still produces powerful off-balances and direct paths to pins.

2. Key Positions / Structures
- Starting ties
  - Front headlock:
    - Chin strap with shoulder on back of neck/upper spine.
    - Secondary control on near triceps/lat to limit posting.
  - Strong overhook:
    - Overhooked arm tight to your ribs.
    - Shoulder heavy on their shoulder, elbow down.
- Body alignment
  - Your hips close to theirs; no long-distance “jump”.
  - Your throwing-side hip slightly behind them, ready to sit to that side.
  - Head facing slightly across their back/shoulder in the intended throw direction.
- Sacrifice path
  - As they push into you or you pull them forward:
    - You sit/roll to your throwing-side hip, not straight back.
    - Your hooked leg (near or far leg, depending on variation) blocks or lifts near their thigh/hip.
    - Upper body steers their head and shoulder over your side.
  - Ideal landing:
    - They go over the top, landing on their back or near back.
    - You follow to top, finishing in mount, side control, or strong upper-body pin.

3. Key Cues
- “Side sacrifice, not straight back.”
- “Head and arm together; don’t throw with a loose headlock.”
- “Sit towards the side you want them to fall, not directly under them.”
- “Keep your leg as a ramp/obstacle, not a low, floppy hook.”
- “As they go, chase with your chest to stop roll-through.”

4. Drills & Games
- Static entry drill
  - Start from kneeling front HL or tight overhook.
  - Partner provides light forward pressure.
  - You:
    - Angle your hips.
    - Sit to throwing-side hip.
    - Gently guide them over your side, focusing on path and control.
  - Build up amplitude gradually.
- Direction-awareness drill
  - From front HL:
    - Partner alternates:
      - Driving straight in.
      - Turning slightly to one side.
    - You choose:
      - Cow catcher when they drive straight and low.
      - Yoko Sumi when angle opens for the side fall.
  - Early rounds: call the choice out loud before executing.
- Positional landing follow-ups
  - Start with them already thrown (on back/side) and you in various top positions.
  - Practise:
    - Converting messy landings into stable side control/mount.
    - Preventing them from rolling to turtle or standing.

5. Common Mistakes
- Falling straight backwards instead of to the side, ending in weak guard positions.
- Trying to sacrifice without first breaking posture or loading their weight.
- Using only arm strength on the neck with no shoulder/torso involvement.
- Failing to follow up after the throw and allowing easy scrambles or roll-throughs.
