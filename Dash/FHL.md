SYSTEM – Front Headlock

1. Purpose
- Make front headlock a central hub for controlling shots, snaps, and level changes.
- Connect front headlock to a reliable menu of takedowns (cow catcher, Yoko Sumi, Ouchi), transitions to back, and submissions.

2. Key Positions / Structures
- Base front HL:
  - Chin strap:
    - Palm cupping underside of chin, forearm under neck.
  - Shoulder contact:
    - Your chest/shoulder resting on back of their neck or upper spine.
  - Secondary control:
    - Near triceps, elbow, or lat to limit posts.
- Head position:
  - Their head below your chest line.
  - Their spine flexed; hips often behind them.
- Standing vs kneeling:
  - Standing:
    - Your feet staggered, hips back, spine straight.
  - Kneeling:
    - One knee near their head, other leg posted for base.

3. Key Cues
- “Head below your chest, not level with it.”
- “Chin strap plus shoulder; don’t just use the arm.”
- “Control at least one arm so they can’t post freely.”
- “From front HL: pin, throw, or take the back – don’t stall.”

4. Drills & Games
- Snap-to-HL entries:
  - From collar ties and pummelling, practise:
    - Snapping the head down.
    - Sliding into chin strap + triceps.
    - Stabilising for 2–3 seconds before releasing or attacking.
- HL takedown menu drill:
  - From stable HL, cycle through:
    - Cow catcher.
    - Yoko Sumi Gaeshi (side sacrifice throw).
    - Ouchi Gari when the leg is available.
  - Run each option as a mini-chain: entry → throw → 3-second control.
- HL positional rounds:
  - Start in front HL (standing or kneeling).
  - Attacker can win by:
    - Pin/back exposure from takedown.
    - Clean back take.
  - Defender can win by:
    - Standing up to neutral.
    - Breaking HL and disengaging without conceding score.

5. Common Mistakes
- Letting their head rise to chest level (HL becomes weak and defensive).
- Using only arm strength with no shoulder support.
- Never controlling an arm, allowing easy posts and stand-ups.
- Snapping head with no plan – just yanking the neck without linking to finishes.
