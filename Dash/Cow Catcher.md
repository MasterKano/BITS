SYSTEM – Cow Catcher

1. Purpose
- Turn front headlock attacks into a high-percentage, low-risk takedown that lands directly into a pinning position.
- Provide a simple counter to shots and level changes that works well for older or less explosive athletes.

2. Key Positions / Structures
- Starting hub:
  - Front headlock or strong chin strap:
    - Your forearm under their jaw/neck, palm cupping chin.
    - Your other arm controlling near triceps or lat.
    - Their head lower than your chest, spine flexed.
- Core structure:
  - Your arm wraps around their head and far arm (head-and-arm).
  - Their near elbow is blocked or elevated so they cannot post.
  - Your hips close enough that their weight is partially on you, not fully under them.
- Finishing alignment:
  - You step and rotate them to the side, pulling head-and-arm across.
  - You land chest-to-chest or chest-to-shoulder with:
    - Head on the far side of their head.
    - Knees wide for base.
    - Their arm still trapped across their body or above the head.

3. Key Cues
- “Control the head and one arm; two posts are too many.”
- “Snap the head below your chest before you go.”
- “Step across and rotate, don’t just yank sideways.”
- “Land with chest heavy and head on the far side.”
- “Keep the head-and-arm until control is secure – don’t let go early.”

4. Drills & Games
- Static entry drill:
  - Start from kneeling front headlock.
  - Build cow catcher step-by-step:
    - Wrap head-and-arm.
    - Block/eliminate near post.
    - Step across and rotate to side.
    - Land and adjust to chest-to-chest pin.
- Shot-to-cow-catcher chain:
  - Partner shoots at 40–60%.
  - You sprawl to front HL, then:
    - Establish head-and-arm.
    - Run the cow catcher to side pin.
  - Focus on clean head position and controlled landings.
- Positional sparring – front HL:
  - Start in front headlock (standing or kneeling).
  - Attacker aims to hit cow catcher to stable side pin.
  - Defender tries to stand, limp arm, or roll.
  - Rotate roles frequently.

5. Common Mistakes
- Trying to throw with only a chin strap and free near arm (they post and escape).
- Pulling sideways with no step/rotation, ending up underneath a roll-through.
- Letting go of the head-and-arm mid-throw, giving them an easy scramble.
- Landing with head on the wrong side, making it easy for them to turn to knees.
